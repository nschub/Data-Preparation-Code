"UBS chief Ermotti hints at keeping Credit Suisse domestic bank ","Shotgun marriage between lenders has attracted criticism within Switzerland","UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti has given the clearest indication yet that his bank intends to keep hold of Credit Suisse’s domestic business in spite of fierce opposition within the country. Speaking at a company-wide meeting this week, Ermotti told Credit Suisse staff that retaining the Swiss bank and merging it with UBS’s domestic business was still the “base case scenario”, according to people who were present. He added: “I don’t think that there is any meaningful value creation [from a spin-off] for clients because the combined organisation can already address all of their needs.”  The fate of Credit Suisse’s domestic business has emerged as one of the most contentious elements of UBS’s takeover of its stricken rival, which was finalised this week. The shotgun marriage between the banks has attracted criticism within Switzerland. A poll published shortly after the deal showed that three-quarters of voters wanted the mega bank to be split up. A month later, Swiss parliamentarians voted against the government’s SFr109bn financial package that underpins the deal in a symbolic protest. A potential merger between the domestic businesses of UBS and Credit Suisse has become a thorny issue ahead of Swiss national elections in October, with politicians warning about the potential for branch closures and job cuts. A combined UBS-Credit Suisse Swiss business would account for 29 per cent of domestic deposits — the same proportion as the total for the 24 government-owned cantonal banks. It would also hold 31 per cent of corporate loans, just behind the 34 per cent for the cantonal banks. When it comes to mortgages, UBS-Credit Suisse would account for 26 per cent of household and 20 per cent of corporate domestic loans, compared to 38 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, for the cantonal banks. Because of the complexity of the Credit Suisse takeover, UBS has pushed back its second-quarter results from July 25 to August 31, when it is expected to announce its final decision over the future of the Swiss business.  During the company town hall on Thursday, Ermotti was asked why the decision on Credit Suisse’s domestic bank was taking so long. He said that the three main considerations for deciding on whether to split off the business were if doing so would benefit customers, create value for UBS shareholders or save jobs. He added that UBS had no intention of running both banks as separate brands under the same corporate umbrella. “That’s not even imaginable, let’s be very clear,” he said. ","17.06.2023"
"UBS sets ‘red lines’ for Credit Suisse staff as it completes takeover ","Diktat is designed to reduce risks of the transaction that was orchestrated by Swiss government","UBS has imposed tight restrictions on Credit Suisse bankers including a ban on new clients from high-risk countries and on complex financial products after completing the takeover of its ailing rival on Monday. UBS executives have drawn up a list of nearly two dozen “red lines” that prohibit Credit Suisse staff from a range of activities from the first day the two banks are combined, according to people with knowledge of the measures. Prohibited activities include taking on clients from countries such as Libya, Russia, Sudan and Venezuela and launching new products without approval from UBS managers.  Ukrainian politicians and state-owned enterprises will also be blocked to prevent potential money laundering. “We are worried about ‘cultural contamination’,” UBS chair Colm Kelleher said last month over taking on Credit Suisse staff. “We are going to have an incredibly high bar for who we bring into UBS.” The prohibitions, written by UBS’s compliance department, are designed to reduce the risks involved in the transaction, which was orchestrated by Swiss authorities three months ago to save Credit Suisse from collapse. UBS confirmed early on Monday that it had completed the takeover. In an open letter, Kelleher and chief executive Sergio Ermotti said: “We will never compromise on UBS’s strong culture, conservative risk approach or quality service.”  UBS executives fear they are taking on a bank that has traditionally been much more willing to accept risky clients and offer them high-stakes products. Credit Suisse’s final few years as an independent company were marked by a series of scandals and crises, which one internal report said were a result of its “lackadaisical attitude towards risk”. UBS finalised an agreement with the Swiss government on Wednesday that will provide the bank with up to SFr9bn ($10bn) to protect it from losses on the rescue. The government assistance would kick in after UBS covered the first SFr5bn of losses.   The loss protection agreement was the final hurdle for UBS to cross before completing the takeover. The list of restrictions — which UBS executives have named “red lines” — cover 11 financial risks and 12 non-financial risks.  While many of the risks are operational — concerning issues such as the distribution of research and use of offices — other decrees affect areas of Credit Suisse’s business more directly. Under the rules, Credit Suisse bankers are unable to trade in a range of arcane financial products, including Korean derivatives and options of certain quantitative indices.  In 2006, Credit Suisse lost $120mn on Korean derivatives, leading to a shake-up of the unit’s management team. But the bank has continued to operate in the market. Credit Suisse employees must also ask UBS executives for permission to extend loans backed by assets such as yachts, ships and real estate of more than $60mn.  As banker to some of the world’s richest people, Credit Suisse has long provided loans to fund billionaires’ private jet purchases, while it has also engaged in yacht finance. Last year, Credit Suisse asked hedge funds and other investors to destroy documents relating to its richest clients’ yachts and private jets following revelations in the Financial Times of a securitisation deal involving loans it made to oligarchs who were later sanctioned. Staff at Credit Suisse’s Swiss bank must ask permission from UBS to extend loans to borrowers outside the country and for foreign property. To limit the risk of money laundering, bribery and corruption, Credit Suisse bankers are also barred from bringing on new clients from a range of high-risk countries. These include Afghanistan, Albania, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Moldova, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Palestine, Russia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe. Credit Suisse staff were sent a company-wide memo on Thursday, telling them to expect new “red lines” on the day the deal closed, though details of the rules were not included.  UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the rules. Separately, Swiss parliamentarians on Thursday voted to empower a special parliamentary commission of inquiry into the downfall of Credit Suisse. ","12.06.2023"
"UBS considers delaying results after Credit Suisse rescue deal ","Pushing second-quarter results until the end of August would buy the bank time to work through complex takeover","UBS is considering delaying its second-quarter results as long as possible as the bank wrestles with the financial and political complexities of its rescue of Credit Suisse, according to people familiar with the matter.  The bank is due to report its results on July 25, but executives are weighing delaying the publication until the end of August when they may also provide investors with an update on their plans for Credit Suisse’s domestic business, the people said. The rescue of Credit Suisse, which was engineered by Swiss authorities in March, is expected to be the most significant and complicated banking merger since the financial crisis. Parts of the deal have already been challenged by politicians and lawyers.  UBS executives had hoped to complete the deal by the start of June — it has already been signed off by the EU’s competition authorities. But the details of Swiss government support are still to be finalised, which means it will not be completed until this week at the earliest, according to people involved in the planning. A further complexity facing UBS’s finance team is combining the two banks’ accounting systems, which each follow different standards. UBS follows the International Financial Reporting Standards, while Credit Suisse uses the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which are more common among US companies. Under IFRS, companies are encouraged to publish their interim results no later than 60 days after the end of the reporting period. The shotgun marriage between the banks has attracted criticism within Switzerland; a poll published shortly after the deal showed that three-quarters of voters wanted the mega bank to be split up. A month later, Swiss parliamentarians voted against the government’s SFr109bn financial package that underpins the deal in a symbolic protest.  Last week, the country’s left-leaning Social Democratic party said it had drawn up plans to halve the bank’s post-merger balance sheet, bringing it down from SFr1.5tn to closer to the country’s gross domestic product of SFr734bn. With Swiss federal elections due in October, politicians have vented their anger over the SFr9bn of support the government has agreed to provide UBS to absorb losses if they run beyond an initial SFr5bn that the company will bear itself. But UBS executives are at pains to show investors they will try to limit their dependence on the state and avoid using the government’s support. Recently returned chief executive Sergio Ermotti has insisted that Swiss taxpayers are “exceptionally unlikely” to suffer losses on the takeover. Ermotti has also dismissed fears that the size of the bank will be a problem for Switzerland, saying it was more important that UBS had agreed to take over a failing institution.  UBS’s original plan to merge its domestic bank with Credit Suisse’s has caused alarm within Switzerland due to fears over branch closures and job cuts. UBS executives have since said that “all options are on the table” over its plans for the Credit Suisse business, with a final decision expected by the end of August. UBS declined to comment on its discussions over delaying its second-quarter results.  Credit Suisse has enlisted its longtime adviser Deloitte to help prepare its accounts for UBS to complete the deal.","04.06.2023"
"UBS prioritises Credit Suisse investment bank integration and cost cuts","Decision on Swiss domestic unit expected within months","UBS has prioritised integrating Credit Suisse’s investment bank and accelerating cost-cutting, while a decision on the future of its Swiss domestic business is expected within months, according to people involved in the planning. UBS’s takeover of its ailing rival is due to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point its newly refreshed senior management team will set about overseeing the biggest bank integration project since the financial crisis. Executives will move first on bringing the two investment banks together to “create clarity on day one” and avoiding “two people going out and calling institutions to sell the same products”, said a person with knowledge of the plans.  In a memo this week, seen by the Financial Times, UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti urged staff to refrain from viewing Credit Suisse workers as competitors.  “Our rivals are those outside of the combined firm who are actively trying to take advantage of the current situation to poach clients, business and talent,” he wrote. UBS plans to wind down much of Credit Suisse’s investment bank, with many of the division’s 17,000 staff likely to be let go.  But UBS is attempting to hold on to bankers who specialise in growth areas such as pharmaceuticals, technology, media and telecoms, because the owners of the businesses could be persuaded to become wealth management clients. The investment bank will continue to be led by Rob Karofsky under the revamped leadership team announced by UBS this week, though the wind-down efforts will be overseen by new head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Beatriz Martin Jimenez. The integrations of Credit Suisse’s wealth management and investment arms will follow, while UBS is planning to make a decision over the fate of its domestic business by the end of the summer, according to a person involved in the plans.  Although UBS had originally intended to keep hold of Credit Suisse’s profitable Swiss universal bank, executives are now open to other options for the business — including a potential carve-out or listing — as a means of preserving thousands of jobs and protecting shareholder value, the person said. The ultimate decision will seek to balance the broad set of moral, social and fiduciary obligations the merger has presented UBS, they added. The bank hopes to make a decision by the end of the summer to avoid it turning into a contentious saga, having already become a subject of intense political debate ahead of October’s Swiss federal election. The domestic Credit Suisse business will continue to be run by André Helfenstein, though he will report into outgoing Credit Suisse chief executive Ulrich Körner, who will join the UBS executive board to oversee the integration process. All current Credit Suisse executives will report to Körner while also reporting to their equivalent head at UBS after the deal completes, which is expected to happen in the coming weeks once regulatory and antitrust approvals have been granted. UBS is also planning to increase cost-cutting after the takeover is done. Credit Suisse executives were already attempting to strip out $2.8bn of costs over three years, but UBS bosses believe those efforts need to go deeper and faster to reflect the plunging revenues in the business since those targets were set last year. Credit Suisse was rescued from collapse after it suffered a second heavy spell of client defections in less than six months.  The cost-cutting efforts will come under the purview of Stefan Seiler, who will be installed as head of human resources and corporate services — responsible for employees, real estate and vendor management. UBS has sent in up to 100 bankers to assess Credit Suisse clients, staff and business lines. The so-called clean team, which was first reported by Bloomberg, has been tasked with determining which relationships should be ended, which workers should be retained and which divisions should be wound down. UBS declined to comment on the plans to integrate Credit Suisse.","12.05.2023"
"Credit Suisse’s lawsuit against SoftBank thrown into doubt after UBS takeover","Japanese conglomerate is client of Swiss bank which recently took over its rival","Credit Suisse’s London High Court lawsuit against SoftBank has been thrown into doubt following the Swiss bank’s rescue by rival UBS, which counts the Japanese conglomerate as a client, according to people with knowledge of the relationship. Since the takeover was completed last week, UBS’s top legal team has been assessing the numerous lawsuits that Credit Suisse is embroiled in to weigh the merits of pursuing them against the potential damage to its business interests and reputation. The deliberations came as SoftBank began its defence in the case brought by Credit Suisse over $440mn of losses tied to Greensill Capital, accusing the Swiss bank of trying to shift the blame for its own failings.  Credit Suisse, which was forced to close $10bn of client funds two years ago after specialist finance firm Greensill imploded, launched formal proceedings against SoftBank in April as part of its long-running attempts to reclaim money on behalf of its wealthiest clients. About 1,000 Credit Suisse clients were left with hundreds of millions of dollars of losses after investing in a suite of supply-chain finance funds tied to Greensill that the Swiss bank marketed as low risk. Credit Suisse has alleged that SoftBank masterminded a financial restructuring of Katerra — a Californian construction company funded by SoftBank’s Vision Fund that was also a client of Greensill — that benefited the Japanese group at the expense of the Swiss bank’s clients. “In an effort to deflect responsibility for its own failings — which Swiss regulators extensively and damningly documented — [Credit Suisse] is now claiming that the SoftBank defendants orchestrated a transaction in late 2020 that was designed to harm [Credit Suisse],” SoftBank’s lawyers wrote in their defence filing, which was lodged last week. “That is categorically false.” The lawsuit centres on $440mn owed to the Swiss bank’s customers by Katerra, which went bankrupt following the collapse of Greensill. Katerra had received the money via Credit Suisse’s supply-chain finance funds. Late in 2020, SoftBank agreed to provide an emergency cash injection into Greensill, which was intended to cover the debts at Katerra. The Financial Times has previously reported that the money never reached the Credit Suisse funds.  “The fact that the Greensill Group subsequently misused the funds for another purpose — which was not discovered by the SoftBank defendants until after the transaction was complete — does not make the SoftBank defendants liable for [the Credit Suisse fund]’s losses,” SoftBank’s defence states. Credit Suisse has 21 days to respond to the SoftBank defence statement. In February, Swiss financial regulator Finma concluded its two-year investigation into Credit Suisse’s failings around the collapse of Greensill and found there had been a “serious breach of Swiss supervisory law”. Of the $10bn locked in the supply-chain funds when they closed, Credit Suisse has reclaimed $7.4bn, with the remaining assets much harder to recoup. It has stated that it could take up to 10 years to resolve the matter through a litany of lawsuits and insurance claims. The bank’s state-orchestrated rescue by UBS has raised questions about whether its new owner will continue with the lawsuit, given its relationship with SoftBank, which is a client of its investment bank, according to two people. Last year UBS was one of several banks involved in the sale of 213mn Alibaba shares as SoftBank raised as much as $22bn in cash by reducing its stake in the Chinese ecommerce giant.  Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. Several other legal cases following on from the collapse of Greensill Capital are coming to a head. This month, the FT reported that Lex Greensill, founder of Greensill Capital, and four former Credit Suisse bankers have been named as suspects in a Swiss criminal case that is due to be formally opened next week. In a separate case, US-based private finance group White Oak has started legal action against Marsh for $143mn in relation to its work for Greensill, arguing the insurance broker failed to pass on crucial information regarding problems with the firm’s insurance cover.

"UBS shortlists four consultants for Credit Suisse integration","Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey and Oliver Wyman in running for lucrative contract","UBS has whittled down its shortlist to four management consultants to advise on its integration of rival Credit Suisse, in what is expected to be one of the most lucrative financial services advisory contracts in recent years. Swiss bank UBS is set to decide whether to award the contract to Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey or Oliver Wyman in the coming days, according to people involved in the process. Smaller contracts could be awarded at later dates for more specialist work, said the same people who warned UBS could decide to reopen the process. UBS executives invited bids from management consultants in the days following its agreement to rescue Credit Suisse in a historic $3.25bn deal that was orchestrated by Swiss authorities.  The task of bringing together for the first time two global systemically important financial institutions is expected to take several years and be fiendishly complicated. The combined group will have 120,000 staff globally, but tens of thousands of job cuts are expected. This week, UBS chair Colm Kelleher replaced chief executive Ralph Hamers with his predecessor Sergio Ermotti in recognition of the scale of the challenge of making the transaction a success. “This is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008,” Kelleher told reporters. “That brings with it significant execution risk.”  Ermotti, who officially starts on Wednesday, is expected to have a say on which consultant is chosen, though the integration process is being led by chief information and digital officer Mike Dargan. Claiming the contract will be a boon for the winning bidder, at a time when banks are generally cutting back on their spending on outside consultants.  Last year, UBS targeted reducing its spending on external advisers as part of a pre-takeover drive to cut $1bn of costs by the end of this year. In recent years, UBS has employed McKinsey to help Hamers develop his strategy for the bank, which was unveiled last year, and to implement an agile working strategy, which is aimed at speeding up decision-making. Some senior bankers have expressed concern about UBS developing an over-reliance on the firm. Similarly, the bank used consultants from Oliver Wyman to advise on its risk management operations and BCG for some smaller projects, according to people familiar with internal workings. Credit Suisse had also been attempting to reduce its use of external advisers, which included a plan to halve spending on consultants last year. It reduced its external consultant headcount by a fifth in the final quarter of 2022. It relied on advice from McKinsey for its two recent restructuring plans — one under former chair António Horta-Osório and the other from last year that aimed at radically reforming the business. As part of the accompanying cost-cutting plans, Credit Suisse sought advice from Oliver Wyman and BCG, while Deloitte provided input on the bank’s pay policy, according to people with knowledge of their involvement. UBS, Bain, BCG, McKinsey and Oliver Wyman declined to comment.  Additional reporting by Michael O’Dwyer ","01.04.2023"
"Putting the BS into UBS","Everything’s going to be fine by 2025; forget 2008-2023","There’s an old joke about how the Swiss have four languages and no intention to be understood, so when required to speak to outsiders they prefer to vandalise a fifth. Keep it in mind while reading this disclaimer now attached to Credit Suisse research: As a result of the recent merger with UBS Group AG, we have refined our multi-asset class investment perspectives to now form our combined House View. Unlike in the past, when our investment perspectives were formed exclusively by the analyses of our investment strategists and research analysts, we have adopted an integrative approach and expanded our intellectual horizon, moving from 3 to 6 months to 12 months. In our ongoing effort to provide the highest quality insights, the new trajectory of investment views will be crafted by the confluence of knowledge from both UBS and Credit Suisse investment professionals. This amalgamation of expertise is intended to enhance your understanding and provide you with an even more robust and diverse lens into the ever-evolving investment landscape.We look forward to sharing this refined perspective with you, and we appreciate your continued readership and engagement. An antidote to all those words comes from Twitter’s Dan Davies, who has an excellent op-ed in today’s MainFT on Switzerland’s approach to banks regulation. When you’re a state-backstopped nation of bankers that’s down to its last G-Sib, there’s not much point in mucking around with the definitions of regulatory capital, he says: [E]ven under the existing rules, Credit Suisse managed to survive a bank run that lasted from the end of last October to the start of March. If four months was not enough time to turn things around, what real benefit is there in providing resources to extend it to five or six? The real problem — and the one that is most psychologically intolerable for bankers and regulators alike — is that when the shit really hits the fan, there is nothing at all that can save a bank. Switzerland signed its too-big-to-fail regulations into law in 2013 then began fiddling almost immediately — most notably with the Aymo Brunetti report published a year later that significantly strengthened leverage ratio requirements. The reasoning then was that Switzerland’s two systemically important banks were oversized relative to GDP, so needed wider buffers than the European norm.  In that context, the UBS-Credit Suisse merger has set Switzerland back by a decade. Its only remaining globally significant bank is as big now as it was in 2012, and is approximately three times the size of the one that proved too big to fix. Chart via Barclays:  A thing investors have been telling themselves recently is that within a couple of years, UBS will be normal again. Management’s target of making the CS merger EPS accretive by 2027 has been lowballed, they reason, because who wouldn’t want to park money in a ward of the Swiss state?  For that reason UBS shares have kept trading at a premium to the peer group based on the 2025 forecasts:  The above chart is from Morgan Stanley, which puts forward the fine-by-2025 theory in a note published today. It argues that wealth management will have grown to $4tn in AUM by that year, while core operations will be rightsized as most of the Credit Suisse markets business will be run off, so reparations can begin for UBS equity holders:    A quick rebuild of capital buffers is a virtuous cycle, not least because it removes the need to raise money from a spinoff or IPO of CS Schweiz, the local bank UBS inherits from Credit Suisse. That’s great for earnings and bad for optics: on a pro forma view UBS is now the biggest Swiss domestic bank by far, with more than a quarter of loans and deposits. Local dominance may be politically awkward when it’s sacking lots of Swiss citizens.  Morgan Stanley’s model is based on UBS retaining CS Schweiz while finding $10.5bn of cost savings (notably higher than management’s $8bn guidance). Finish the job by 2025 and there’s enough spare capital swilling around to fund $9bn of share buybacks over the next two years, it estimates:   It’s plausible in theory — though Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders might not appreciate cash being given to UBS shareholders less than three years after their own wipeout. The analysis also presumes no further step up in capital requirements, which given recent history seems brave.  On the one hand, as Davies says, a capital ratio is no protection when shit is hitting the fan. On the other hand, demanding fatter capital ratios is pretty much all a regulator can do in a hurry.  Brunetti wrote last month that while waiting for global agreements on the way forward, countries with oversized banks should “seriously consider taking earlier actions such as significantly higher capital requirements for transactions that endanger global resolvability”: Given the internationally record-breaking size of Switzerland’s largest bank in relation to GDP, the country simply cannot afford an UBS with a state guarantee. Larger countries might have the fiscal means to do this but subsidising global banks is an especially inefficient and unfair policy. Regulator Finma has said (in typically tortured English) that UBS has until 2030 at the latest to comply in full with current capital requirements. There’s also a post-CS independent review of the regulatory framework due for delivery to the Swiss parliament within the next 12 months.  In these circumstances it’s heroic to believe that UBS can complete the integration of a globally significant basket-case five years early then begin throwing off cash, without also inviting capital criteria to be toughened further. Any investor holding the shares on that basis is encouraged to go back and read that CS-UBS research disclaimer again, if only for a reminder that what’s said in Switzerland can be poor guide for outsiders about what’s really happening.

"How will UBS strip back Credit Suisse’s investment bank?","Reducing the lossmaking and capital-intensive business to its bones will be no easy task","In the days after agreeing to rescue Credit Suisse, UBS executives rushed to assure investors they would not let their rival’s scandal-plagued investment bank infect their own.  With the takeover complete, UBS is now embarking on a project few have succeeded in doing before: stripping the lossmaking and capital-intensive business back to its bare bones. “If UBS proves they can crunch down Credit Suisse’s balance sheet in a value-neutral way it could have big consequences for the banking sector as a whole,” said Justin Bisseker, banking analyst at fund manager Schroders.  “Could the likes of Barclays or Deutsche be inspired to collapse their underperforming investment banks if there was no value drag?” More than three months after the shotgun wedding was agreed, there are still few details about what UBS intends to do with Credit Suisse’s investment bank beyond the target for the combined investment banking businesses to account for no more than 25 per cent of risk-weighted assets.  At the end of 2022, both UBS and Credit Suisse had investment banks that accounted for about 30 per cent of group RWAs. Assuming Credit Suisse’s business bears the brunt of the cuts, its RWAs could drop by two-thirds. Analysts and shareholders are expecting UBS to provide more clarity when the bank reports its delayed second-quarter results on August 31. They have already begun speculating about the fate of a business that employs thousands of bankers, has hundreds of billions of dollars of leveraged exposure and was the source of so many of its crises in recent years. The task of overseeing the wind-down has been handed to Bea Martin, the former UBS group treasurer, who combines her new role as head of non-core and legacy with being president of Europe, Middle East and Africa. While the likes of Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland have hacked back their investment banks over the past decade, UBS’s task is more daunting given it is merging two businesses at the same time and also dealing with the riskier products that Credit Suisse offered.  “Credit Suisse was more exotic and had a higher risk tolerance compared to UBS in a big way,” said a person involved in the wind-down plans. “UBS is also dealing with different systems, people and culture — which all creates added layers of complexity.” Divergent fortunes A comparison of the two investment banks highlights the differing paths of UBS and Credit Suisse in recent years. Based on first-quarter results, the UBS business generated more than twice the revenues of its former competitor but with just 24 per cent higher costs, resulting in UBS’s investment bank producing a $2.1bn profit, compared with a $1.4bn loss at Credit Suisse. Since the global financial crisis, UBS has been restructuring its investment bank to service its much bigger wealth management business, focusing on areas such as equities, foreign exchange and certain underwriting and advisory services. UBS’s investment bank has accounted for 25-30 per cent of the wider group’s profits since the bank cut back its fixed-income division a decade ago.

			 Credit Suisse has belatedly tried to follow a similar strategy but its investment bank has weighed it down over the past five years with an aggregate $2.8bn loss over the period, thanks to a litany of trading losses, regulatory fines and legal expenses.  Two years ago it suffered the biggest trading loss in its 167-year history following the collapse of family office Archegos Capital Management. The initial $5.5bn hit is set to be exacerbated by fines, the Financial Times reported last week, with regulators having concluded their investigations into the case. The business was also embroiled in a string of ill-fated deals, including its involvement in the $2bn Mozambique “tuna bonds” scandal.  Despite some attempts in recent years to de-risk and shrink the investment bank, Credit Suisse’s main problem was that the areas it excelled at — such as high-yield and securitised products, leveraged finance and certain advisory markets — were of little interest to its wealth management clients. “Most of this business, which was already undergoing an extensive restructuring, is likely to be radically downsized or closed,” said Nicholas Watts, banks analyst at Redburn, the Rothschild-owned research business. He predicted that by 2027, UBS will have slashed 85 per cent of jobs and costs from Credit Suisse’s investment bank, meaning 14,500 bankers and $4.7bn of expenses would go. A person with knowledge of UBS’s plans said fewer investment bankers would lose their jobs, while another added that the number of redundancies from the combined group would be about 20,000 of a total workforce of slightly more than 100,000 but cautioned that it was too early to outline final numbers.  Johann Scholtz, banks analyst at Morningstar, expected even heavier cuts. Of the $8bn overall reduction in spending UBS has earmarked from the takeover by 2027, he predicted 70 per cent — or $5.6bn — would come from Credit Suisse’s investment bank. “Reducing the size of Credit Suisse’s capital-hungry investment banking operations will release significant capital that UBS can return to shareholders,” he added. As part of its strategic review unveiled late last year, Credit Suisse set up the non-core unit — a “bad bank” to wind down exposures in unwanted businesses and release capital. UBS will use this as the basis for its own plans to reduce its former rival’s investment bank. “Credit Suisse used the NCU as a capital optimisation strategy — the intention was to release capital rather than eliminate business that were non-core — and they executed it very slowly,” said the person involved in the wind-down plans.  “For UBS, the NCU will be the starting point, plus on top a bunch of businesses that remain in the Credit Suisse investment bank that UBS does not want, such as leveraged finance, complex derivatives and loans in countries where UBS does not have a presence.” They added that while Credit Suisse had $130bn of leverage exposure in the NCU, that could rise to between $250bn and $300bn after UBS decides where to cut back.  UBS executives secured an agreement whereby the Swiss state would provide up to SFr9bn ($10bn) to cover losses associated with the wind-down after UBS had borne the first SFr5bn. The terms were struck in mid-March, at the height of a banking crisis that followed the collapse of US lender Silicon Valley bank. Since then markets have calmed and UBS executives are keen to avoid using taxpayers’ money for a deal that is unpopular domestically. “UBS will be hesitant to use these support measures, as . . . it could limit UBS’s options when it comes to returning excess capital to shareholders,” Scholtz added. Picking and choosing There are some bits of Credit Suisse’s investment bank that UBS would like to retain, however. These are mostly in areas of banking and advisory that are high-growth and where business founders can be persuaded to become wealth management clients. For sectors such as technology and pharmaceuticals in the US and Asia-Pacific, UBS has made generous offers to retain a select group of Credit Suisse bankers, according to people familiar with the plans. “Credit Suisse, from its First Boston and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette heritage, has exceptional capabilities and presence across the Americas, particularly across investment banking,” said a person with knowledge of UBS’s plans. “The acceleration of our strategy in the US represents one of the most exciting aspects of the integration.” UBS has also taken advantage of disquiet at Barclays by poaching at least 10 senior investment bankers in New York, according to people familiar with the moves. “UBS has been very aggressive on hiring for certain roles,” said a headhunter involved in some of the negotiations. “There are certain people who have been on their radar for a few years and now UBS are striking hard.” Given the size of the task ahead, UBS chair Colm Kelleher has said the integration of Credit Suisse could take up to four years. But the person involved in discussions with UBS over the wind-down said the process could be much quicker. “UBS has a strong management team, a large integration team and will be fully focused on being as speedy as possible,” they said. “I think they will deliver in two years.” A rival banker who advises financial institutions added: “UBS are likely to approach this in the same way they dealt with SG Warburg 25 years ago — they will take the best people and close everything else down. But the big difference this time is they are taking on idiosyncratic risks within the Credit Suisse business.”","29.06.2023"
"Five senior Credit Suisse executives leave after UBS takeover","Chief financial officer Dixit Joshi and general counsel Markus Diethelm are among departures","UBS has announced the departure of five of the most senior Credit Suisse executives just hours after sealing the official takeover of its Swiss rival. Among those leaving are Dixit Joshi, chief financial officer, Markus Diethelm, general counsel, Edwin Low, head of the Asia-Pacific region, David Miller, co-head of the investment bank, and Ken Pang, co-head of markets. The exits were disclosed in an internal memo seen by the Financial Times and confirmed by UBS, which also revealed that Francesco De Ferrari, who had run Credit Suisse’s wealth management arm, will become a senior adviser to UBS wealth head Iqbal Khan.  “The acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS has now legally closed, marking a historic moment for both banks,” wrote Ulrich Körner, who has stayed on as chief executive of Credit Suisse, which will be run as a subsidiary of UBS during the integration process. UBS’s rescue of Credit Suisse, which was engineered by Swiss authorities three months ago, was completed on Monday. The takeover is the most complicated bank merger since the financial crisis. Speaking to Swiss television on Monday, UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti said 10 per cent of Credit Suisse’s workforce had left in recent months.  Further job cuts are expected in the coming weeks, with Credit Suisse’s investment bank and its domestic business — should it be retained by UBS — expected to bear the brunt of redundancies. In order to limit its risk from the transaction, UBS has set out almost two-dozen “red lines” for Credit Suisse staff to follow, which restrict certain activities such as bringing on new clients from high-risk countries and offering complex financial products. UBS executives fear they are taking on a bank that has traditionally been much more willing to accept risky clients and offer them high-stakes products.   “We are worried about ‘cultural contamination’,” UBS chair Colm Kelleher said last month about taking on Credit Suisse staff. “We are going to have an incredibly high bar for who we bring into UBS.” Among other Credit Suisse executives who have secured roles at UBS are Joanne Hannaford, former chief technology and operations officer, and former Credit Suisse chief risk officer David Wildermuth, who has been named chief risk officer for the Americas. Michael Ebert, who co-led Credit Suisse’s investment bank with Miller, has been made sole head of the business as well as head of the Americas for UBS’s investment bank. Four Credit Suisse senior executives — head of HR Christine Graeff, Swiss bank head André Helfenstein, chief operating officer Francesca McDonagh and chief compliance officer Nita Patel — have all retained their roles. “While the transaction has closed, the most crucial phase is just beginning,” wrote Kelleher and Ermotti in a separate email to staff on Monday morning.  “We cannot cling to old rivalries, or be distracted by the integration and external pressures.”  In a further email to UBS’s wealth management staff seen by the FT, Khan said Yves-Alain Sommerhalder would run Credit Suisse’s wealth arm, while former Credit Suisse executive Jin Yee Young had returned, having joined Deutsche Bank at the start of the year, to be co-head of wealth management in Asia-Pacific. “We will have combined market leadership in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and the power to rival the biggest players in the US market,” Khan said.","12.06.2023"
"UBS finalises $10bn deal with Swiss government over Credit Suisse losses","Parliament on Thursday voted to empower special commission of inquiry into downfall of bank","UBS has finalised an agreement with the Swiss government that will provide the bank with up to SFr9bn ($10bn) to protect it from losses on the rescue of Credit Suisse. The loss protection agreement is the final hurdle for UBS to cross before completing the takeover early next week. In talks with Swiss authorities over rescuing its rival Credit Suisse in March, UBS convinced the government to contribute up to SFr9bn to cover losses the bank would make in winding down unwanted assets.  The government assistance would kick in after UBS covered the first SFr5bn of losses. The guarantee covers a SFr44bn portfolio of Credit Suisse assets that UBS plans to wind down — equivalent to 3 per cent of the combined group’s total assets and made up of mainly derivatives, loans, legacy assets and structured products in the investment bank. “UBS will manage these assets in a prudent and diligent manner and intends to minimise any losses and maximise value realisation on these assets,” the bank said on Friday.  “It also will cover the initial and ongoing external costs incurred by the Confederation and Finma for the [loss protection agreement].” The rescue of Credit Suisse, which was engineered by Swiss authorities, is expected to be the most significant and complicated banking merger since the financial crisis.  The size of government support for the deal — which also includes a SFr100bn liquidity line — and the potential for job cuts and branch closures in Switzerland has led to criticism domestically.  Swiss parliamentarians on Thursday voted to empower a special parliamentary commission of inquiry into the downfall of Credit Suisse. It is only the fifth occasion such a committee — with unlimited powers of subpoena and the ability to compel testimony — has been created in the 175-year history of the current Swiss constitution.   The commission is certain to call on present and former senior executives from both UBS and Credit Suisse to give sworn public testimony, as well as government ministers and regulators.  It is likely to be a boon for angered Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bondholders, wiped out by the deal, who are in the early stages of legal action against the Swiss government. With the federal election due in October, the political environment for UBS is unlikely to be favourable.  A poll published shortly after the deal was announced showed that three-quarters of voters wanted the mega bank to be split up.  A month later, Swiss parliamentarians voted against the government’s SFr109bn financial package that underpins the deal in a symbolic protest. Last month, the country’s left-leaning Social Democratic party said it had drawn up plans to halve the bank’s post-merger balance sheet, bringing it down from SFr1.5tn to closer to the country’s gross domestic product of SFr734bn.  UBS executives are at pains to show investors they will try to limit their dependence on the state and avoid using the government’s support. Recently returned chief executive Sergio Ermotti has insisted that Swiss taxpayers are “exceptionally unlikely” to suffer losses on the takeover. As part of the agreement, UBS will pay SFr40mn to the Swiss government for setting up the guarantee, a SFr36mn annual maintenance fee while it is in place and interest on the money it uses, which ranges from 0.4 per cent to 4 per cent, depending on how much is drawn down. On Wednesday UBS confirmed Financial Times reporting that it would push back its second-quarter results from July 25 to August 31 in recognition of the complicated task of bringing together two accounting frameworks.

"UBS/Credit Suisse: ‘badwill’ bonanza is prelude to a tough integration","To deploy an accounting cherry attractively, you first need a cake to put it on","“Badwill” sounds like something that could sour a business deal. Instead, it can be the cherry on the cake. The accounting tweak, more commonly called “negative goodwill”, will add $34.8bn to the profits of UBS. That compares to the price of just $3.5bn the Swiss wealth manager agreed to pay for troubled rival Credit Suisse. The question for investors is whether the double negative counts as a single positive for UBS. Badwill is crystallised when an acquirer buys a target below the fair value of its net assets. Accountants register it as a gain via the income statement when they add those intangible assets to the balance sheet. Regulators permit some or all of the amount to count towards capital buffers.  Credit Suisse disclosed shareholders’ equity of $48.8bn at the end of 2022. UBS will warily put the smaller figure of $34.8bn through its income statement. Its bean counters have built in a discount to allow for potential hits to Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. These range from asset value haircuts to expected litigation costs of $4bn.   The sum is still substantial. But investors had hoped for more. In a presentation, UBS estimated that after the deal closes this quarter it would have buffer capital of $81bn, defined as common equity tier one capital. That is $8bn below the total forecast by Barclays analysts.  Moreover, $34.8bn is tiddly, measured against $275bn of risk-weighted assets that UBS will absorb from Credit Suisse.   So how should we view UBS’s badwill bonanza? The first point is that this is a paper gain. It is not in cash, payable to shareholders in dividends. The second issue is that the value of badwill could easily be squeezed on the balance sheet by the discovery of further skeletons in Credit Suisse’s boneyard of a closet. The market rightly remains fixated on whether UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti can integrate Credit Suisse to create a larger, more profitable bank. That will determine whether UBS can catch up with sector indices it currently lags behind. To deploy an accounting cherry attractively, you first need a cake to put it on. ","17.05.2023"
"UBS faces hit of hundreds of millions of dollars over Credit Suisse’s Archegos failings","Findings over failings at Swiss bank related to dealings with family office set to be published soon by global regulators","UBS faces hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties over Credit Suisse’s mishandling of Archegos Capital after Swiss, US and UK regulators completed their investigations into the affair, according to people with knowledge of the probes. Credit Suisse, whose takeover by rival UBS was completed last week, suffered the biggest trading loss in its 167-year history when family office Archegos imploded in March 2021. The bank had asked Switzerland’s Finma, the US Federal Reserve and the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority to publish their findings and announce any penalties jointly at the end of July, said four people briefed on the plans. But the timing of the publications could slip as a result of UBS’s takeover.  The Fed’s fine could be as much as $300mn, while the PRA could impose a penalty of up to £100mn, according to one person, though both could be negotiated down as part of settlement talks that have begun. Finma does not have authority to fine financial institutions, though it plans to publish its report into the bank’s failings over Archegos. UBS has up to $4bn of provisions to cover regulatory and litigation costs from its takeover, which was orchestrated by Swiss authorities in March. The Archegos affair is one of several unresolved legal and regulatory matters that UBS has taken on in buying Credit Suisse. These include lawsuits over its involvement in defunct finance firm Greensill Capital, a US tax evasion case, a lawsuit brought by the Republic of Mozambique and private litigation over US residential mortgage-backed securities. It is also appealing against cases brought by Bidzina Ivanishvili, the former Georgian prime minister, and another over its dealings with a group of Bulgarian cocaine smugglers. Credit Suisse had set aside just $35mn for potential fines over Archegos, another person added.  The bank’s $5.5bn hit on the collapse of Archegos was by far the biggest out of total losses of $10bn for international banks that offered the family office prime broking services. UBS made a $861mn loss. Under fund manager Bill Hwang, Archegos made tens of billions of dollars of bets on US and Chinese stocks by borrowing heavily from banks’ prime brokerage divisions, which had to be rapidly unwound when the value of the companies slumped and the firm could not meet margin calls. Credit Suisse commissioned its own investigation into its failings over Archegos, which was carried out by law firm Paul Weiss. The 172-page report found that the losses were the result of a “fundamental failure of management and controls” in Credit Suisse’s investment bank and a “lackadaisical attitude towards risk”. The bank made just $17.5mn from the relationship in its final year, despite extending billions of dollars of credit to the family office. Credit Suisse, UBS, Finma, the Fed and the PRA all declined to comment. Last week the Financial Times reported that Lex Greensill, Greensill Capital’s founder, and four former Credit Suisse bankers had been named as suspects in a Swiss criminal case due to be formally opened this month.","19.06.2023"
"UBS details lower than expected $35bn gain from Credit Suisse rescue","Swiss bank expects asset writedowns and litigation provisions to total $17bn","UBS said it expects to make a $35bn accounting gain as a result of its state-brokered rescue of Credit Suisse, lower than some had forecast, and separately disclosed $17bn of asset writedowns and litigation provisions. In a US regulatory filing on Wednesday, the Swiss lender detailed, for the first time, its early estimates for the financial impact of the merger — the largest bank deal since the financial crisis that is expected to take as long as four years to finalise due to its complexity. UBS said it should make a $34.8bn accounting gain on the transaction, generated because it acquired its rival for a fraction of the book value of its assets. The so-called “negative goodwill” is calculated by subtracting the $3.5bn acquisition price from the roughly $38bn fair value of the net assets.  This is lower than the theoretical $57bn of profit it could have booked because of a host of factors including changes to the fair market value of assets, pension liabilities and adjustments made because the two lenders used different accounting standards. The lower than expected equity and capital benefits disclosed “nullifies elements of the bull case in our view and lends further support to our more cautious stance on UBS”, said KBW analyst Thomas Hallett. “With many unknowns and potential risks to work through, we believe investors are better served sitting on the sidelines until visibility improves.” “The release is a reminder of how much accounting noise will be present for the majority of the next decade at UBS — the messiness will last many years,” he added. Nevertheless, the negative goodwill will provide a paper profit for UBS that can be used to cushion the various losses and integration costs of the deal. Controversially, the Swiss government and regulator Finma also paved the way for the bank to write off $17.1bn of additional tier one bonds — debt instruments that can convert into equity — which has provoked investor lawsuits. In the filing, UBS said it will mark down Credit Suisse’s assets by $13bn, set aside $4bn to cover regulatory and litigation matters and flagged that there will be an additional restructuring charge after the transaction closes.  The main assets to be written down are Swiss mortgages and trading assets, particularly from those investment banking businesses that UBS plans to exit.  Anke Reingen, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said her calculations had anticipated a higher common equity tier 1 level of 15.4 per cent versus the 14.2 per cent that UBS disclosed on Wednesday. The stock was little changed after the release. After years of scandal and losses, the Swiss establishment stepped in to make UBS rescue its ailing rival in March following hundreds of billions of client withdrawals that threatened to topple Credit Suisse. The state provided more than SFr250bn ($278bn) of public funds and guaranteed SFr5bn in losses to sweeten the deal for UBS. The filing revealed other details about the merger. UBS saved roughly $400mn by cancelling a Credit Suisse staff bonus scheme that was linked to the AT1 bonds. It has also banned Credit Suisse from issuing new credit lines of more than SFr100mn to investment grade companies and SFr50mn for junk borrowers. UBS expects to make a gain of $1bn on Credit Suisse’s global real estate portfolio, but that will be more than offset by a $2bn loss on its capitalised software assets.","17.05.2023"
"UBS narrows list of Credit Suisse executives for leadership team","Chief executive Sergio Ermotti is betting on them to help make the rescue deal work","UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti has shortlisted the Credit Suisse executives he plans to make part of his management team, betting they can help make a success of the most significant banking deal since the financial crisis. Among the Credit Suisse executives most likely to survive the takeover are Dixit Joshi, chief financial officer, Francesca McDonagh, chief operating officer, and André Helfenstein, head of the Swiss business, according to several people familiar with the plans. Ermotti, who returned to run UBS in March after the bank agreed to rescue its Zurich rival in a $3.25bn deal orchestrated by Swiss authorities, is planning to unveil his new top team in the next week, with the takeover due to be completed by early June.  UBS is preparing for a costly and risky integration process as it attempts to combine two global systemically important financial institutions in the most significant banking deal since the financial crisis. Colm Kelleher, the bank’s chair, has said the integration could take up to four years, while elements of the deal — including the decision by Finma, the Swiss banking regulator, to wipe out $17bn worth of bonds — are being challenged in the courts. The completion of the deal hinges on receiving regulatory approval and sign off from competition authorities. While most main regulators have given a green light, the European Commission said the EU’s antitrust bodies will make a decision by June 7. Joshi and McDonagh joined Credit Suisse late last year, leaving them untainted by the bank’s recent scandals. Joshi started as CFO on October 1 and was immediately thrust into the bank’s efforts to hold on to fleeing customers following a damaging weekend of social media rumours about its financial health. He was heavily involved in the bank’s $4.3bn capital raise in his first few weeks in the job. His brief stint in the role has also been marked by Credit Suisse delaying the release of its annual report in March after the US Securities and Exchange Commission made some last minute requests for additional information over its internal controls dating back to 2019.  McDonagh, who left her role as chief executive of Bank of Ireland to join Credit Suisse, was hired to be head of the Emea region. But before she started, she was given the COO role and instructed to oversee a huge restructuring of the business. As part of cutting $2.8bn in costs over three years, she had begun to reassess Credit Suisse’s global office footprint — including its underused 21-storey London headquarters in Canary Wharf, which it leases from the Qatar Investment Authority. But that review was put on hold when the deal with UBS was struck. Helfenstein has run Credit Suisse’s domestic bank for the past three years and is the longest-serving executive board member, having joined when Thomas Gottstein became chief executive in 2020. UBS executives see Credit Suisse’s domestic business as its “jewel in the crown” and would prefer to keep it intact. But combining it with UBS’s own Swiss business has proved unpopular domestically and executives have said all options are on the table for the unit. Last week Swiss newspaper NZZ reported that Tom Naratil, who ran UBS’s US business and was co-head of its wealth management division until last year, would return as part of the new management team as chief financial officer. Naratil has undertaken a finance role at West Point, the US military academy, this year, having left UBS in October. He had previously been UBS’s CFO between 2011 and 2015.  UBS declined to comment on plans for the new executive team. ","06.05.2023"
"UBS/Morgan Stanley: Credit Suisse should help Ermotti close the gap","Forced purchase of struggling Swiss peer enables the bank to move closer to US rival in valuation","Markets reward a listed business’s “journey” to higher profits, less so its arrival. The price of a fare on the UBS train has risen of late to around 1.3 times tangible book, the highest in five years. Yet that valuation would need to nearly double to catch up with US rival Morgan Stanley.  The forced purchase of struggling Swiss peer Credit Suisse may take UBS some way towards that goal. However, UBS will have to sort through the baggage of its target first. Tuesday’s first-quarter results gave investors a peek at how UBS had been doing before the deal. They were presented by Sergio Ermotti, the formidable former boss who has already replaced seat-warming Dutchman Ralph Hamers.   There were few surprises. A common equity tier one ratio of 13.9 per cent was slightly lower than expected.  More importantly, Ermotti offered a snapshot of a combined business with some $5tn of invested assets. Getting there without the deal would have taken UBS another 7-10 years.  Should investors reward UBS for its unexpected great leap forward with a bigger valuation multiple, something closer to Morgan Stanley’s 2.1 times tangible book? Greater scale should help but the groups already have much in common. At the end of March, UBS’s underlying 15 per cent return on tangible equity trails that of Morgan Stanley by roughly two percentage points. Growth rates for net earnings per share look similar to 2025, though UBS will have integration costs to come that analysts have yet to model.  There are key differences, of course. Morgan Stanley is highly exposed to the dynamic US economy. Its core Japanese shareholder Mitsubishi UFJ owns 22.6 per cent. US index funds have large stakes too. One theory is that these holdings amplify the effect that good results have on the share price via a restricted free float. UBS cannot replicate those attributes. But it should, in time, be able to narrow the valuation gap with its US rival, not least because Morgan Stanley’s large investment bank will generate earnings uncertainty.

"Is UBS the new Swiss government (bond)?","Too Zug to fail ","Rui Soares is an investment professional for FAM Frankfurt Asset Management, an independent investment firm. The collapse of Credit Suisse and takeover by UBS created the ultimate Swiss behemoth.  New UBS will have total assets of around Sfr1.6tn, accounting for about 200 per cent of Swiss GDP. To put things in context: BNP Paribas’s balance sheet size accounts for approximately 100 per cent of France’s GDP. Deutsche Bank’s for around 35 per cent of German GDP and JPMorgan’s for about 15 per cent of US GDP. It’s beyond reasonable argument that New UBS is too big to fail; and too big to resolve.  So why are New UBS senior unsecured bonds trading between 90 and 190 basis points wider than Swiss government bonds?  [zoom] Let’s imagine that some time down the road, NewCo UBS collapses like Credit Suisse did. Let’s assume for a moment that the Swiss government of the day will want to keep the control of the bank in Switzerland, and that a shotgun marriage with a foreign entity for some token amount is not possible. National pride may be at stake, or perhaps a desire to keep trade secrets close to home.  The Swiss authorities will be left with one option only: nationalisation. Shareholders will be bailed-in, as will AT1 bondholders. But after the asset write-downs on the left side of the balance sheet and bail-in of financial instruments on the right side, the bank may still be left undercapitalised. What then? One could now argue that in such an event the Swiss government could bail-in Tier 2 bonds and even force, via a “Notgesetz”, a bail-in of plain vanilla senior unsecured bonds. None of that is implausible, particularly for Tier 2 , but the cost of wiping out senior unsecured bonds is to establish Switzerland as an international pariah.  If the Swiss government did allow the collapsing bank to be sold to a foreign entity, would the picture change? No. Any bail-in of senior unsecured bonds would here too trigger a buyers’ strike and effectively force the Swiss government to become the buyer of any senior unsecured bonds to be issued over the following years.  No matter how you slice it, the result is always the same: if NewCo UBS becomes OldCo CS, either there are enough AT1 and Tier 2 bonds to be bailed-in and fully recapitalise the bank or the Swiss government will have to step in and inject taxpayers’ money in the local behemoth. Bailing-in senior debt holders will not be really feasible. UBS senior unsecured bonds are Swiss government bonds in disguise. Shouldn’t the credit spread between the two narrow?

"UBS revamps leadership as it prepares to complete Credit Suisse deal","Credit Suisse chief Ulrich Körner to join UBS’s executive board as part of shake-up","UBS has said Credit Suisse chief executive Ulrich Körner will join its executive board to help steer the integration of the bank, as rivals attempt to capitalise on what is expected to be a fraught process. Körner, who was drafted in as CEO last year to help revive the lender’s fortunes, will help the execution of the most significant banking takeover since the financial crisis.  The Swiss-German, who previously worked at UBS, would be “responsible for ensuring Credit Suisse’s operational continuity and client focus”, UBS said on Tuesday.  The installation of Körner on the board comes as the $3.25bn takeover of Credit Suisse, a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators in March, is set to be complete within a matter of weeks. UBS chief Sergio Ermotti warned staff on Tuesday to expect “tense and difficult moments ahead”.  “Please remember, your new colleagues are not your competitors,” he said in a memo. “Our rivals are those outside of the combined firm who are actively trying to take advantage of the current situation to poach clients, business and talent.” Ermotti will hold a town hall for UBS staff on Tuesday afternoon. Santander is among the competitors seeking to poach staff from Credit Suisse, while Deutsche Bank has already recruited several managing directors. The appointment of Körner to the board was the highest-profile of several changes announced by UBS on Tuesday. Michelle Bereaux, a 23-year UBS veteran, was appointed group integration officer. Todd Tuckner, currently finance chief of its wealth management division, will succeed Sarah Youngwood as chief financial officer. Youngwood, who joined UBS last year, will leave the bank.  All existing Credit Suisse executive board members who are also division heads will report to Körner and their respective UBS executive board members, UBS said. The new appointments will come into effect when the transaction closes. Beatriz Martin Jimenez, head of the UK for UBS and group treasurer, will be head of non-core and legacy — responsible for overseeing parts of the business that are being wound down — as well as head of Emea. She will retain her UK role, but a successor as group treasurer will be named in due course. UBS has also installed Stefan Seiler as head of human resources and corporate services.  After the deal is completed, the two businesses will initially operate as separate entities, with each serving their own clients and dealing with counterparties. UBS said Credit Suisse would continue to use its governance and risk control frameworks, though UBS would implement new policies to boost its oversight of the business. ","09.05.2023"

"UBS + CS = ? ","What a weekend","First of all, spare a thought for our colleagues at mainFT who have after a wild week kept working through the entire weekend and churned out scoop after scoop.  Like this absolute banger:  UBS offers to buy Credit Suisse for up to $1bnSwiss authorities expected to change country’s law to bypass UBS shareholder voteUBS has offered to buy Credit Suisse for up to $1bn, with Swiss authorities planning to change the country’s laws to bypass a shareholder vote on the transaction as they rush to finalise a deal before Monday.  There’s obviously still a lot going on, and a lot of uncertainty about what the final deal looks like.   For example, FT Alphaville is intrigued by the Material Adverse Change deal clause that stipulates UBS can walk away if its CDS prices jump by 100 bps or more. How Credit Suisse bondholders (specifically the AT1s) will fare with this deal also remains murky. Tape bombs like this won’t help matters either.  We also bet Credit Suisse shareholders (and its executives) are having a shitfit, as the price looks sensationally low — valuing the $575bn-in-assets global banking giant at approximately half a Shake Shack, AMC or Cheesecake Factory, or one Nikola. Or one fifth of GameStop.  However, the Swiss authorities seem absolutely determined to ram this through by the end of today. So here are the main issues that JPMorgan’s European banks analyst Kian Abouhossein sees with the deal’s current contours. • Is the transaction with UBS done as part of pre-resolution acquisition or post which has material impact on Equity, AT1 and debt investors in terms of potential write-downs? We believe it is likely to be pre resolution as it would have implications for the broader market, Switzerland as a financial center as well as Global Financial institutions as CSG is a G-SIB, hence the transaction would have material implications for AT1 instruments, funding costs and Cost of Equity going forward for the Global banking sector. We note a recent FT article which suggests potential discussions on an all-share deal between the two banks with UBS offering to buy CSG for up to $1bn to be paid in UBS stock — we would see this outcome as positive that likely avoids resolution. Without knowing more details, this should be long-term accretive for UBS in our view. • What happens with the Swiss Bank or CS (Schweiz) entity of CSG i.e. is it part of the transaction with UBS and UBS later spins-off the entity to avoid market share concentration issues? In our note, we had expected a spinoff/IPO with a valuation in the CHF 10bn range for Credit Suisse (Schweiz AG). In addition, could the Swiss Bank shares be used as part of some form of compensation to CSG S/Hs? • What happens to the IB which has several moving parts including SPG sale to Apollo, CSFB, Non-core unit and the remainder Markets business? Press reports suggest a divestment of the IB as part of the scenarios being discussed which would be inline with what we expected, but the scope of the exercise is not clear at this point. On our assumptions, the cost of IB exit would be CHF 9.7bn on a post-tax basis which is inline with the allocated Equity to the division including SPG. Our assumption would be a completion of the SPG transaction and divestment of remaining IB. As highlighted by CSG previously, a CSFB spin-off or IPO was indicated not to take place until 2025 and hence we believe it would have material implications for funding and potential capital consumption for UBS NewCo. • Ring-fencing and litigation are going to be key points in our view especially for the UBS supervisory board which has to act in the best interest of its S/Hs in our view. Press reports suggest UBS is seeking government guarantees of about $6bn which would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges. We note that CSG at the end of 2022 had CHF 1.2bn in litigation provisions and an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses of CHF 0-1.2bn for litigation issues not covered by existing provisions. We include CHF 3bn in cumulative litigation provisions by YE2025 in our current capital forecasts. We also believe with increasing size following this potential transaction, UBS would need to be gold-plated in terms of capital and liquidity position. Our assumption would be the usage of part of badwill for covering any restructuring. • Finally, earnings accretion for UBS from this potential transaction is difficult to ascertain without details such as the acquisition price in an M&A scenario, exact structure of the transaction i.e. in-scope businesses. UBS would need to make any transaction accretive to its S/Hs inline with general mandates of the Supervisory board when signing off the transaction. We believe the transaction could be accretive for UBS in the long-term on our sensitivity, however, besides the terms of the transaction/ is it pre or post resolution, what is also key is the remaining AuM/deposit base of CSG, considering press reports indicate material outflows over last few days.

"UBS set for biggest banking profit once Credit Suisse deal closes","Swiss lender attracted $28bn of new money as clients moved accounts from rival - but integration risk still high  ","UBS is set to record the biggest ever banking profit next quarter after it completes the takeover of Credit Suisse, owing to the rock-bottom price it negotiated to rescue its ailing rival.  Thanks to an accounting gain known as negative goodwill — or badwill — that companies can book from buying undervalued businesses, UBS stands to record up to $57bn in profits on the acquisition, which is due to be completed next month. UBS agreed to pay $3.25bn for Credit Suisse, which has a book value of $60bn, and has been at pains to underline the execution risk involved in closing the deal.  In first-quarter results released on Tuesday, UBS said its wealth business attracted $28bn of new money in the first three months of the year, as the Swiss bank benefited from the deepening crisis at Credit Suisse that led to its takeover. UBS said $7bn had flowed into its wealth arm after it agreed to rescue its rival in a deal pulled together by Swiss authorities last month. UBS’s asset management arm also sucked in $14bn during the quarter, while net new fee-generating assets grew by $8bn in its Swiss business. The snapshot from UBS comes a day after Credit Suisse revealed it suffered $69bn of outflows during the quarter. “Our solid underlying performance and strong inflows this quarter demonstrate that we continue to be a source of stability for our clients during periods of significant uncertainty,” said UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti, who returned last month to steer the integration of its rival. While the inflows point to the benefits of its $3.25bn takeover of Credit Suisse, the deal also brings significant challenges with analysts wary of the costs and time it will take to integrate the bank. The lender said on Tuesday it expected to complete the acquisition next month and would provide more details about the integration and its plans to wind down much of its rival’s investment bank.  “With this transaction, we expect to reinforce our position as a leading and truly global wealth manager with strategic scale and complementary capabilities in the most attractive growth markets,” added Ermotti. UBS said it had spent $70mn on advisory fees related to the deal, while Ermotti confirmed the takeover had received clearance from Swiss authorities, the US Federal Reserve and the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority. Antitrust regulators are expected to give the green light to the transaction in the coming weeks, he said. UBS would also need to file a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission before the takeover could be completed in May. Ermotti said he would spend the next two weeks deciding on the make-up of his executive team to carry out the integration, which could include members of the Credit Suisse management board. The bank’s acquisition of Credit Suisse dominated UBS’s first quarter, when it made $1bn of net profit, down 52 per cent from the same period a year ago and below analysts’ estimates. The results were hit after UBS increased its provisions by $665mn for litigation related to mortgage-backed securities. Ermotti said the bank was in advanced discussions with the US Department of Justice over the matter, which dates back 15 years. Shares in UBS dropped as much as 5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday, but had recovered to trade down just 1 per cent by early afternoon.   Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Thomas Hallett described the results as “lacklustre”, adding: “Overall, the bar was set low into earnings and yet results still managed to disappoint.” UBS said geopolitical tensions between China and the US, along with the Russia-Ukraine war, had caused uncertainty in asset valuations and the economic outlook, prompting many clients to diversify their cash holdings by investing in money market funds. The bank repurchased $1.3bn of shares in the quarter, though the buyback programme was temporarily suspended after the announcement of the Credit Suisse deal.","25.04.2023"
"UBS/Credit Suisse: Swiss bank would be a valuable asset to lose","A spin-off might appeal to some politicians but domestic arm is both profitable and a feeder for UBS’s wealth management business","Ironically, it was the bailout of UBS during the financial crisis that forced Credit Suisse to ringfence its Swiss banking business from riskier operations almost a decade ago. Now the shotgun wedding of the two former rivals threatens to create the largest, single, private financial risk Switzerland has faced.  That issue is fuelling gossip over a possible spin-off of Credit Suisse’s domestic operations. It is hardly an outcome UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti would vote for. The Swiss domestic bank has long been Credit Suisse’s most profitable division. It has managed to swerve the turmoil that has engulfed the investment banking and wealth management arms.   Former Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam mooted the idea of selling a 30 per cent stake in the Swiss bank in 2017. Encountering fierce resistance from investors, he opted for a rights issue instead.  Shareholders could be expected to rally against any new spin-off plan. Keeping the unit is a no-brainer.  The likely elimination of client overlaps means that revenues would be lower following an integration. If revenues fell by a third from last year’s Srf4bn, the Swiss domestic bank would be worth $5bn less at $10bn. But estimated cost savings from integration would be worth an additional $11bn, once taxed and capitalised.  Recall that UBS is only paying Sfr3bn ($3.3bn) for Credit Suisse and is receiving substantial state guarantees. Credit Suisse’s Swiss banking arm is not only a hugely valuable asset on its own, but is also a feeder for the wealth management business that is crucial to the fortunes of UBS. Spinning off the Swiss domestic bank might appeal to some Swiss politicians. Job cuts would be fewer. Single-entity risks to financial stability would be lower.   However, the political and financial elite that pushed through UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse has nailed its colours to the mast. It provided a waiver allowing UBS to breach antitrust concentration limits. It is unlikely to invite further controversy by rejigging the deal.

"Breaking down the historic rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS","DD explains the extraordinary takeover","One note to start: It was an eventful weekend in European banking and beyond. In this first-ever Monday edition of DD, we seek to explain how Credit Suisse, an institution on the brink of disaster, found itself taken over by its fiercest rival UBS. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com The weekend race to sell Credit Suisse to UBS UBS on Sunday hastily agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for $3.25bn, an emergency takeover assembled in a five-day sprint as the Swiss government and global banking regulators worked to contain the intensifying financial panic.  The takeover is the most significant repercussion of a global bank run that began in California 10 days ago. The swift action was meant to prevent a failure that would likely have sparked the biggest banking crisis since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, culminating in a shotgun deal regulators hope will restore faith in the financial system.   “The bankruptcy of a globally systemic bank would have caused irreparable economic turmoil in Switzerland and throughout the world,” Swiss federal finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter said at a press conference in Bern on Sunday evening.  Swiss federal president Alain Berset (right), Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter (centre), and Swiss National Bank chair Thomas Jordan arrive for a press conference for UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse in Bern on Sunday © PETER KLAUNZER/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The FT had all the scoops on how a once unthinkable union between Switzerland’s two largest banks came together over the weekend.  UBS called it an “acquisition,” while CS appeared to soften the blow of the fire sale by characterising it as a “merger.” DD likes to think of it as a forced marriage.  It will create one of the biggest banks in Europe. UBS has $1.1tn of total assets on its balance sheet while CS has $575bn. The drama began on Friday with a report by DD’s Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-Khan and our colleagues Laura Noonan, Stephen Morris and Owen Walker, that UBS and CS had begun merger talks under the stewardship of the Swiss central bank. Regulators in Switzerland told their US and UK counterparts that evening that merging the two banks was “plan A” to stop a collapse in investor confidence in CS, as the 167-year-old bank suffered a detrimental capital flight.  A sale of CS would typically draw in teams from major banks and asset management firms, even as the lender struggled to move past a series of blistering crises.  Indeed, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, explored a bid for CS. The effort, led by the $8.6tn money manager’s boss Larry Fink included a number of possibilities, including bidding on portions of CS rather than the whole bank. But BlackRock, which had been informally working with senior bankers at Perella Weinberg Partners, abandoned the effort after deciding there were no attractive options. Policymakers knew clinching a deal before markets in Asia opened on Monday was paramount, and effectively signalled that UBS was CS’s only hope. Takeover talks marched deep into Sunday as Swiss regulators held calls with US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen and British chancellor Jeremy Hunt to update them on the negotiations. Talks moved fast and as details leaked, traders were often left dumbfounded. When UBS early on Sunday bid SFr0.25 a share for CS, valuing it at roughly $1bn, the bank asked for a clause to get out of the deal if the cost to insure its debts rose by just 100 basis points —— something that would have given the market reason to believe it could quickly collapse.  That offer was rejected by CS’s board but negotiations continued. CS was given the code name Cedar and UBS was referred to as Ulmus, Latin for Elm, according to people briefed on the matter.  By afternoon, a palatable takeover agreement began to take shape. UBS increased its offer to more than $2bn and dropped the aforementioned clause to get out of the transaction, a move intended to help reassure the market that the deal wouldn’t unravel.    At nightfall in Zurich, UBS announced a stock-for-stock takeover that valued CS at about SFr3bn, less than half its closing value on Friday. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase advised UBS, while Centerview Partners advised CS, sources said.  In Bern, UBS chair Colm Kelleher and CS chair Axel Lehmann joined top Swiss government and regulatory officials at a press conference to outline the takeover. UBS chair Colm Kelleher during the press conference on Sunday © AFP via Getty Images The deal will lead to a dramatic downsizing of CS’s investment bank, putting thousands of jobs at risk. It also puts a plan led by investment banker Michael Klein to spin off the operation and rename it Credit Suisse First Boston on life support. The Swiss National Bank has offered a SFr100bn liquidity line backed by a federal default guarantee to UBS. Meanwhile, the government is also providing a loss guarantee of up to SFr9bn, but only after UBS has borne the first SFr5bn of losses on certain assets. There’s one key feature of the deal that will have broad repercussions today.  While CS shareholders have managed to get a small recovery, holders of SFr16bn in CS’s Additional Tier 1 bonds — which were introduced by regulators after the financial crisis to help shore up banks’ balance sheets — haven’t been so lucky.  These bonds will be wiped out, which could lead to a broader sell-off in AT1 bonds issued by European banks.  The demise of CS is, of course, a huge blow to the bank’s new boss Ulrich Körner, a former top UBS executive who hoped that the latest restructuring effort would be the one that stuck. He was hamstrung by a fast-spreading regional bank crisis in the US, where Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank both failed over one fateful weekend, and CS’s own inability to file its annual statements. Körner spent just eight months on the job.  The fire sale caps off a calamitous few years at the Swiss lender, which has been burnt by twin crises linked to specialist finance group Greensill Capital and family office Archegos Capital Management. The lifeline from UBS is aimed at protecting the very fabric of Swiss banking, while global financial regulators hope it will act as a firewall against a spreading banking crisis. It also remains unclear whether a $30bn infusion of deposits into US lender First Republic will succeed in stemming a bank run among large regional lenders. On Sunday, rating agency Standard & Poors downgraded the bank’s debt ratings. It has been looking at a sale, but a deal has yet to emerge.  UBS presented what it said was compelling financial logic for its Credit Suisse deal. But there’s no guarantee it will be a success for the bank or the wider financial system. “This deal is announced, and this deal will be executed. It is absolutely necessary for the financial structure of Switzerland,” said an adamant Kelleher.  Now all eyes are on the US to see if there will be a takeover of First Republic and a broader guarantee of bank deposits.

"Walnuts and conspiracies: Credit Suisse and UBS shareholders vent about takeover","Two weeks after Switzerland forced together its two biggest banks, investors had the opportunity to voice their concerns","It was the first shareholder meeting in four years, and the last of 167. Three police vans stood outside the entrance to the Hallenstadion on the outskirts of Zurich, as a crowd of mostly older white faces shuffled into Credit Suisse’s annual meeting. Two protesters — a mother and daughter — stood silently holding a banner: “Justice for Mozambique” — a reference to just one of the many scandals in recent years that brought Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s most illustrious bank, founded in 1856, to this point.  It is barely a fortnight since the Swiss government forced the lender into the arms of its bigger domestic rival: engineering a takeover by UBS to stave off Credit Suisse’s imminent collapse, the biggest casualty of central banks’ monetary policy tightening. This week it was the turn of shareholders in the two Swiss banks — denied a voice by government fiat in the terms of the merger itself — to have their say. “It’s strange. I don’t know. It’s almost satirical really,” said Sergio Gerosa, as he stood holding his voting card outside the entrance to the Hallenstadion ice hockey arena on Tuesday morning. “It’s a snapshot of the modern financial economy.” Protesters demonstrate at the entrance of the Credit Suisse meeting © Michael Buholzer/Keystone via AP Neither company is regarded with much affection in Switzerland anymore. Just one in five Swiss banks with either. But the takeover closes a longstanding divide in the country. Most Swiss, if pressed, would declare some affinity to one side or the other. Credit Suisse was the great, liberal powerhouse of protestant Zurich’s 19th century ascendancy: a Buddenbrooks bank. UBS was the upstart, a more aggressive union of banks whose origins were in Basel, the catholic, cultural — French-facing — industrial city on the Rhine.   Since the 1970s the two have been locked in a fight for dominance. It was not so long ago that Credit Suisse seemed the inevitable victor. During the 2008 financial crisis, it was UBS that was bailed out, with a SFr60bn lifeline from the government. “After the financial crisis we were named the ‘Best Bank Globally’,” said Credit Suisse’s chair Axel Lehmann, as he opened the annual meeting in the Hallenstadion. “The years since . . . that is the bitter reality.” Shareholders listen solemnly at the Credit Suisse meeting © Michael Buholzer/Keystone via AP The crackle of anger that had hung over proceedings seemed to lift. Lehmann had, after all, only been in charge of the board for the past two years. Ulrich Körner, Credit Suisse’s chief executive, had been in charge for even less — nine months.  “We didn’t succeed. We ran out of time. This fills me with sorrow,” he said. “What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come.” The tone over the five subsequent hours was funereal, with solemnity giving way to flashes of absurdity, humour and rage.  There was even a wake. Some shareholders began drinking at the free bar before the final set of resolutions had been voted on. There were speeches and pointed questions to the board on pay and strategy from institutional shareholders. Vincent Kaufmann, of Ethos, a proxy adviser representing more than 3 per cent of shareholders, said the collapse of Credit Suisse had been “a debacle without precedent”.  Patrik Salzmann, a lawyer from Zurich, was even more forensic. His list of questions — asking for date-by-date figures on asset outflows — sounded like a deposition. When Lehmann told him his time was up and he must stop, Salzmann coolly refused. “I am a shareholder, Mr Lehmann, and I have the right to speak.” The hall broke out into applause. Chair Colm Kelleher at the UBS meeting in Basel © Pierre Albouy/Reuters Preachers, lawyers, scions of the super-rich, pensioners, young socialists and velour-clad rustics — the most charismatic of the lot — took to the podium. “I came without my gun this morning,” said the first speaker, Guido Röthlisberger — an attempt to poke fun at the heavy security of the event. He was wearing a red tie, he added, because “many shareholders are seeing red”. Daniel Engler, a politician for Switzerland’s conservative Christian Federal Democratic Union party, reminded shareholders that once — back in 2007 or so — a single Credit Suisse share was worth around SFr80, “the price of a chateaubriand!”.  Now he lamented, they can only buy you a croissant. His homily then swerved into a reflection on the sanctity of the cross that each Swiss franc (and the country’s flag) bears. He lost the crowd when he hinted at how, in holier times, the board might have been crucified for their crimes. A Credit Suisse shareholder makes his point on stage © Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg More resonant was the moment another shareholder pulled a handful of walnuts from his pocket, proffering them to Lehmann as the fair exchange for shares in the once great bank. Wednesday in Basel was a much different affair, although some of the same shareholders were present. Martin Kaufmann, of Meilen, a Credit Suisse and UBS shareholder, turned up to declare on Wednesday that he would like to speak for 167 seconds — one for every year of Credit Suisse’s existence, before its takeover. At minute three his gesture began to lose its symbolism. At minute five, he asked the UBS board whether they might consider suing the Financial Times for its coverage of the takeover. It was not the most jolting moment of the morning. That came when Stephan Zurfluh burst into anti-capitalist song. Not so long ago, he had recounted by way of introduction, security had ejected him from a shopping centre in Baden for busking. UBS owned that mall. This appeared to be his revenge. In the round, however, UBS’s annual meeting was an occasion for restrained concern — with occasional flashes at the possibility that the bank may just have pulled off the deal of the century. Throughout, Colm Kelleher, the bank’s Irish chair, was at pains to emphasise the scale of the challenge that merging with Credit Suisse poses.  There was some common threads between the two meetings: time and again, Swiss shareholders seemed to blame the influence of “foreign” values on the situation both banks now find themselves in.  The end of the final Credit Suisse annual meeting © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images It was Credit Suisse’s drift into “American” investment banking that caused this crisis, just as it had for UBS in 2008, said some shareholders, while others called for the end of “the culture of bonuses”.  At times others drifted into conspiracy. Washington has got what it wanted and “destroyed Swiss banking”, one Credit Suisse shareholder claimed, before suggesting that UBS would itself become a target. Calmer voices from both shareholder groups, meanwhile, pointed out the sheer scale of the bank that was being created. The combined entity will have a balance sheet bigger than the Swiss National Bank’s.  “From my perspective, the problem is that UBS is now far too big,” said Regula Schoch, a Credit Suisse shareholder of one week.  “I don’t know how we’re going to deal with it — that’s the really big problem and there are fears there that it won’t work — for Switzerland it’s really, really bad.” ​Letter in response to this article: Basel’s ties to Calvin made it a key Reformation city / From Matthias Stanisic, London SW1, UK","06.04.2023"
"Sergio Ermotti returns as UBS chief to steer Credit Suisse takeover","Ralph Hamers ousted after agreeing $3.25bn rescue deal","UBS has ousted its chief executive and brought back former boss Sergio Ermotti to steer the takeover of Credit Suisse less than two weeks after the announcement of the contentious $3.25bn rescue deal. Ermotti, UBS chief executive for nine years before stepping down in 2020, will lead the effort to merge two of the world’s biggest banks after Ralph Hamers was pushed aside. “I cannot emphasise how big a deal this is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required,” UBS chair Colm Kelleher said on Wednesday. “It’s about having the best person in our opinion to effect the execution of this merger.”  He added he had initially called Ermotti to see if he was interested in the job on Monday last week — the day after Hamers gave a fumbling performance on an analyst call on the takeover. Hamers said he was “stepping aside in the interests of the new combined entity and its stakeholders, including Switzerland and its financial sector”. He added: “I am of course sorry to leave UBS, but circumstances have changed in ways that none of us expected.” The takeover, orchestrated by Swiss authorities, will create the world’s fourth largest bank, with 120,000 staff and $5tn of assets under management. But it is politically divisive, with more than three-quarters of Swiss voters calling for the combined mega bank to be split up by new legislation.  Bondholders are also preparing legal proceedings against the Swiss government after $17bn of high-risk securities were wiped out in the transaction.  Kelleher said Ermotti’s work in scaling back UBS’s investment bank a decade ago and his experience of operating at a global level were essential for overseeing the biggest bank merger since 2008. He added that Hamers, chief executive since November 2020, had put the bank “in a position to stabilise Credit Suisse and ensure a successful integration”, but that Ermotti would “hit the ground running”. Ermotti will start on April 5, while Hamers will remain as an adviser for a transition period. UBS shares closed nearly 4 per cent higher, with investors welcoming the change.  “As a shareholder and bondholder, we are very happy,” said Davide Serra, chief executive of Algebris, who added that Ermotti would reduce integration risk and “serve [the bank’s] clients and not . . . investment bankers”. Since leaving UBS, Ermotti has chaired the reinsurer Swiss Re as well as a special purpose acquisition company that bought Italian luxury fashion group Ermenegildo Zegna.  Mark Diethelm, an analyst at Vontobel, said Ermotti’s experience in transforming UBS after the financial crisis would be crucial, noting that the bank was “already facing significant political pressure due to its large size and importance for the country”. Hamers joined UBS from ING after spending 25 years at the Dutch lender, seven of them as chief executive. He was a surprise choice for the UBS job, despite having been handpicked by then-chair Axel Weber. Critics pointed to his lack of experience in wealth management and investment banking, UBS’s two biggest businesses. He was viewed as a digital expert who could help cut back the bank’s cost base, but his ideas took time to implement. It was more than a year before he unveiled his plan for the business, which consisted of targeting wealthy clients in the US and Asia. But a central plank of the strategy — a $1.4bn takeover of US robo-adviser Wealthfront — was aborted last year. The deal found little support within UBS’s senior ranks because of the cost of the deal and the limited number of rich customers it would attract.","29.03.2023"
"UBS/Sergio Ermotti: old guard gives new deal better chance of success","Expect former CEO to follow same playbook as before — with powerful chair at his elbow","Switzerland’s Sergio Ermotti has replaced Dutchman Ralph Hamers as chief executive of UBS only 10 days after its shotgun marriage to Credit Suisse. But this is not a “Swiss solution”, chair Colm Kelleher insisted.  The phrase “Irish intervention” may be more apt. Ermotti has better credentials to handle one of the most critical integrations in banking history. This serves Swiss national interests, invoked by politicians in forcing UBS to absorb its failing rival. However, globetrotting Irishman Kelleher is responsible for the switch. He has displayed judicious ruthlessness. Last year, Kelleher scrapped Hamers’ ill-advised $1.4bn takeover of US robo adviser Wealthfront. If rising interest rates had not helped UBS to deliver record profits, the deal might have finished Hamers then.  Ermotti was the UBS chief for nine years. He restructured a bank bailed out by the Swiss government. Cutting down the investment bank to a service division triggered fury that turned to plaudits. Expect Ermotti to follow the same playbook again — with his powerful chair at his elbow. This will be the first integration of two globally systemically important investment banks. Execution risks will also be systemic. A target reduction in pro forma risk-weighted investment bank assets from 30 per cent to 25 per cent is a starting point. Credit Suisse’s non-core side already accounted for about a quarter of total divisional RWAs of $80bn. Securitised products, which Apollo is buying, represents another $20bn. These alone should take UBS to its immediate goal Fixed income will feature in the cull. Equities are a better fit with wealth management clients. That did not stop Credit Suisse fuelling an Asian expansion with cheap loans to Asian tycoons in the 2010s. Ermotti will inspect these assets gingerly. UBS will dispense with the bulk of the markets division, worth another quarter of investment banking RWAs. Combined with a 10 per cent loss of asset-based fees the hit to revenues might be $5bn from a total of $13bn for Credit Suisse, thinks Citi.   US financier Michael Klein now has little chance of resurrecting the Credit Suisse First Boston brand. He may still be able to field some assets on the cheap. Integrating these would be a walk in the park compared with what Ermotti faces. As Hamers clears his desk, he may comfort himself by imagining what he has been spared.  The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

"UBS shareholders line up to question Credit Suisse deal at AGM","Chair Colm Kelleher warns of ‘significant execution risks’ in emergency takeover  ","UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse entails “a huge amount of risk”, the bank’s chair Colm Kelleher warned on Wednesday, as shareholders lined up to express concerns over the landmark deal — agreed just a fortnight earlier without their consent.  Speaking at UBS’s annual general meeting in Basel, Kelleher said the acquisition of UBS’s biggest rival was a “milestone” in global finance that would accelerate the bank’s existing strategy — with growth focused in the US and Asia — but cautioned that “this is not in any way an easy deal to do”. “You cannot just put numbers together and reach a sum — you have to understand there is a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,” he said.   Swiss authorities triggered UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse roughly two weeks ago, in a $3.25bn emergency takeover cobbled together over the course of a weekend, to try to avert a potentially catastrophic banking collapse. “We made a choice on behalf of Switzerland, UBS’s place in Switzerland, and on what was best for the global financial system,” said Kelleher.  “This is a Herculean task,” said Lukas Gähwiler, UBS vice-chair. “We had only 48 hours to conduct our due diligence, so many questions thus remain unanswered . . . Great uncertainty will remain.  “I can understand why people are bewildered, even angry,” he added. The transaction will catapult UBS into position as the fourth-largest lender worldwide, with $5tn in assets under management, and confirm its place as the bank of choice for the world’s super-rich. But it will take years to accomplish and will come under significant political and regulatory scrutiny.  “We are concerned about this new giant bank,” said Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of the Ethos foundation, a group representing more than 3 per cent of UBS’s shares at the AGM. “There is a huge concentration of risk in the Swiss market,” he pointed out, noting that 50 per cent of all mortgages in the city of Geneva will be held by the bank.   In taking over Credit Suisse, UBS was “taking over Credit Suisse’s risks . . . which we have warned about for years,” said Nicolas Götschmann of another large shareholder proxy advisor Actares. He asked for assurances that UBS would move swiftly to scale back risky investment banking activities.  UBS shareholders met just a day after Credit Suisse’s AGM in Zurich — the last in the bank’s 167-year history.  Executives there struck a more sombre tone. Chair Axel Lehmann said he was “truly sorry” that events had brought the bank to the end of its independent existence. After more than two years of successive scandals, a weakened Credit Suisse fell victim to the sudden global liquidity shock that hit the financial system following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the US. “The bitterness, anger and shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments of the past few weeks is palpable,” Lehmann said. Some Credit Suisse shareholders — whose shares will be converted into UBS shares at a ratio of 22.48:1 — also turned up in Basel.   The price paid was “a cheek”, said Urs Stüdi, who lambasted Credit Suisse’s board for having wrecked the bank and forced it into UBS’s arms.  Martin Kaufmann, of Meilen on lake Zurich, said he had “never wanted to be a UBS shareholder”, but woke up on a Monday morning last month and discovered that he would be. “I would like to encourage everyone to buy UBS shares,” he said, before launching into a criticism of the derisory way Credit Suisse had been treated in the negotiations to save it.  Swiss shareholders of both banks repeatedly criticised remuneration practices and risk-taking.  “We need to learn the lessons from the Credit Suisse disaster,” said Martin Schütz, who inherited UBS shares from his mother. “We need to radically change the culture of bonuses . . . otherwise we will be waking up one day with UBS having gone down the drain as well.”","05.04.2023"

After a fumbled press conference — perhaps one of the most critical in Swiss banking in a generation — UBS chair Colm Kelleher knew time was up. Kelleher had just driven the takeover of Credit Suisse but was watching his colleague UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers struggle to answer questions about the deal.  A quick phone call was made and then dinner was convened. Just six days later, Sergio Ermotti, the former chief executive of UBS, was back in his old job. From left, Ralph Hamers, Sergio Ermotti and Colm Kelleher © FT montage/Bloomberg Ermotti, who ran the bank for nine years before Hamers stepped in, is now facing the biggest challenge of his career. He will oversee a banking megamerger — never before have two global systemically important financial institutions been combined — and have to manage the political heat that comes with it.  The combination between UBS and Credit Suisse had been dreamt up by Ermotti long before. During his previous tenure at UBS, he had drafted plans to acquire Credit Suisse “three or four times”, two people familiar with his thinking told the FT. He will be charged with executing the technical aspects of the merger and deciding if he needs to make changes to the executive board — including the possibility of bringing back other former UBS staff. Ermotti’s previous experience at the helm of UBS will have engendered him to the board. He put wealth management at the centre of his strategy to reinvigorate UBS after the financial crisis, choosing to scale back investment banking. However, he resisted calls from some to exit the business altogether. “Coming back to manage this situation is a challenge, but also . . . I felt a call of duty,” Ermotti said. “It would be a bit of a contradiction from me not to accept the job to execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”  Ermotti returns to the top with a powerful ally in Kelleher, who has made it clear that he’s the one pulling the strings. Kelleher had grown frustrated with Hamers, who had cut his teeth at Dutch lender ING before former chair Axel Weber named him chief executive. Despite racking up record quarterly profits, Hamers was criticised for his lack of experience in UBS’s two main business lines, investment banking and wealth management.  His ambitions to make UBS the “Netflix for wealth”, meanwhile, were struggling to deliver. It was a point of contention as the valuations of other wealth managers surged, including Kelleher’s former employer Morgan Stanley. By the time UBS scrapped its planned $1.4bn takeover of US robo-adviser Wealthfront last year, a deal central to Hamers’ innovation drive, Hamers’ authority within the bank came into question. The UBS chair did not mince words when announcing Ermotti’s appointment: “It’s about having the best person in our opinion to effect the execution of this merger.” The bank whisperer who cleaned up SVB and Signature During Thanksgiving 2008, Todd Snyder, a star Wall Street investment banker and avid cook, got a call while he was preparing a turkey dinner.   The Bush Administration wanted his help in pending rescue bailouts for General Motors and Chrysler. Snyder, who then led the restructuring group at Rothschild & Co. and happened to have a deep interest in public policy, threw off his apron and set to work. Those passions would come in handy in the last two weeks as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation tapped Snyder, a Weil Gotshal lawyer-turned-banker, to sell Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  After leaving Rothschild in 2017, Snyder set up his own shop, TRS Advisors. He then sold it to Piper Sandler for as much as $46mn. Sandler already had a top-tier investment banking practice that focused on regional financial services firms, making it the perfect fit when the FDIC came calling. The arrangement appears to have paid off: shares in Signature’s and SVB’s new buyers have surged and the banking sector has momentarily stabilised. Snyder also negotiated some upside for the FDIC. The FT’s Stephen Gandel and DD’s Sujeet Indap go deep into the “hard to fluster” adviser’s unconventional path to writing the restructuring playbook. Chris Hohn makes his own luck DD doubts Chris Hohn could’ve known that Rishi Sunak would one day wind up as Britain’s prime minister when he hired him to work at his Mayfair hedge fund back in 2006. But the billionaire activist does seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to choosing battles he will win. On Wednesday, Hohn claimed a victory after Airbus abandoned a deal to buy a minority stake in the cyber security and data division of French IT group Atos. Hohn, whose fund TCI is one of the plane maker’s largest shareholders, had argued the deal appeared to be a “bailout of Atos, a company that is burdened with unsustainable levels of debt and other liabilities”. The decision could prove a headache for the French government as Atos owns sensitive quantum computing assets and cyber defences that Paris considers to be strategic. It’s the second time Hohn got his way this week, after his campaign to oust three board members at European mobile towers group Cellnex gained traction. The company on Monday appointed a new board chair. Hohn is no stranger in picking difficult fights. He has inserted himself in a railroad takeover drama, challenged the Italian government and weighed in on Rupert Murdoch’s dealmaking. But justifying his colossal performance fees (he paid himself more than £1.5mn a day last year thanks to TCI’s banner profits) will take more than a few safe bets. While activists such as Elliott Management and Trian Partners have made peace with Salesforce and Disney after achieving moderate changes and quick stock pops, it’s Hohn who swung the heaviest bat this year.

"UBS/wealth management: Hamers must minimise client flight","Business clusters benefit from scale and diversity but both are diminished by the loss of Credit Suisse","Wealth management is a product as emblematic of Switzerland as Toblerone. The chocolate is losing its emblem of the Matterhorn mountain as a result of offshoring. Swiss authorities do not want the branding of wealth management to weaken too. That is one reason they have pushed struggling Credit Suisse into a shotgun wedding with larger rival UBS. Daily outflows of more than SFr10bn daily from Credit Suisse late last week chilled a wealth management and private banking sector that habitually tops global rankings. In 2021, Switzerland harboured assets of $2.5tn, followed by Hong Kong with $2.3tn and Singapore with $1.5tn, according to Boston Consulting.  Combining Credit Suisse and UBS should create a Swiss national champion in wealth management with $1.8tn in fee-paying pro-forma assets and 11,000 relationship managers. The onus is on UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers and divisional boss Iqbal Khan to integrate the businesses in a way that minimises capital flight. The latter’s familiarity with Credit Suisse’s relationship managers may well help UBS hold on to assets.  Their main problem is that a proportion of clients have accounts with both banks. Many will move money to other institutions to reduce concentration risk. They are likely to have baked in a loss of perhaps a fifth of client assets.  Gulf investors have extra reasons for pulling funds. Saudi National Bank owns nearly a tenth of Credit Suisse shares and worsened depositor panic last week by ruling out a capital injection. It has taken a savage haircut via the forced sale of the company.  But any fugitive money may stay in Switzerland. The country has a healthy ecosystem of smaller wealth managers and private banks. These include Julius Baer with around $460bn in year-end assets under management. The next tier are Pictet, with $280bn of wealth assets, Lombard Odier, Vontobel and EFG.  Without Credit Suisse, UBS will be the only Swiss bank with a big balance sheet from which the highest-rolling private clients might want to borrow. That matters when sophisticated margin lending is required. Swiss authorities took hard, fast action to halt a collapse. That does not automatically strengthen wealth management credentials by reducing Switzerland’s top tier of banks from two to one. Business clusters benefit from scale and diversity. Both are diminished by the loss of Credit Suisse.

"Art Basel/UBS report finds slowing growth despite big-ticket successes","China loses ground to UK as global art market hits $68bn","The global art market generated an estimated $67.8bn of sales in 2022, its highest level since 2014 but not as strong as many expected, finds the latest Art Basel/UBS Art Market report, released today. “While the year was certainly marked by exceptional sales and events, the overall results were much more mixed . . . resulting in more muted growth than anticipated,” writes Clare McAndrew, founder of consultancy Arts Economics and the author of the annual report. High-profile, money-spinning public sales, notably Christie’s $1.6bn haul from the collection of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, had given the impression of a stellar 2022.  Overall, she paints a picture of a top-heavy, fragmented market, running hard to stand still in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Annual sales grew 3 per cent, a sharp slowdown from the previous year’s 31 per cent gain, though 2021 was heavily flattered by the impact of most regions coming out of pandemic restrictions. Sales of art-related NFTs fell by half, to $1.5bn.  China proved the greatest geographic casualty last year: sales overall fell 14 per cent in 2022 to $11.2bn as the country’s zero-Covid policies took their toll and the wealth of its billionaire population decreased by 27 per cent. China’s loss was the UK’s gain, back in the second spot in the global rankings and with higher sales (up 5 per cent) and improved market share (18 per cent, up one percentage point on 2021), boosted by its dealer community. Despite the pressures and complexities of Brexit, the report found that the UK was the most international of markets, with 60 per cent of dealer sales made to overseas buyers­. At the other end of the scale, dealers in mainland China made only 13 per cent of sales internationally.  The annual shuffle between China and the UK for the second spot pales when compared to the growing dominance of the US market, motored out of New York and accounting for 45 per cent of global market value in 2022 (43 per cent in 2021), with sales up 8 per cent. The headquarters of most of the world’s heavyweight dealers are in New York and this is where the priciest auction sales happen­. In 2022, 41 of the top 50 lots were sold in New York, including last year’s bestseller, Andy Warhol’s “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” (1964) for $195mn, including fees. Auctioneer Jussi Pylkkänen selling Warhol’s ‘Shot Sage Blue Marilyn’ (1964) © Emilio Madrid McAndrew splits the art market into two broad sections — auctions (mostly public but including private sales made by auction houses) and dealers. The latter operate privately, so McAndrew gets their numbers through a survey which she has run for more than 15 years; it had just over 1,300 respondents this time. She found that the dealer segment, made up of nearly 300,000 businesses, accounted for 55 per cent of market share in 2022 and grew sales by 7 per cent. The auction sector fell by 2 per cent, something that McAndrew acknowledges came as a surprise in what seemed to be a bumper year. “If you look beyond the press releases, it is a different story,” she says. She notes that Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips all reported record years, with combined turnover up 11 per cent, but she identifies more than 500 middle-tier auction houses, below the handful at the top, where the picture was more mixed. A separate survey of about 100 mid-level auctioneers found that profits at 40 per cent fell in 2022. Problems of polarisation persist throughout the market. At auction, the $10mn-plus works segment was the only area to increase in value (up 12 per cent) and accounted for 32 per cent of value but only half a percentage of volume last year. Dealers reflect a similar dynamic — the greatest growth and profitability was reported by those with a turnover of more than $10mn. These dealers also report the highest share of sales at art fairs and the highest average number of exhibitions per year (13), feeding the top-level frenzy. At galleries with a turnover below $250,000, sales fell by 3 per cent, compounded by the cost of living crisis that affected both their own operations and the spending power of their clients.  The costs of the art business capped growth last year: the report notes that shipping in particular had “rocketed”, with some dealers putting this at 40 per cent of expenditure, up from 20 per cent in 2021.  Online sales have fallen back considerably since the height of the pandemic (from 25 per cent of turnover in 2020 to 16 per cent in 2022). These are still above their pre-pandemic levels and, the report found, here to stay — notably to bring in the all-important new buyers. Looking ahead, McAndrew finds that art businesses are in stress-test mode, working out how best to navigate the challenging economic environment and their own activities within it. She tells the Financial Times: “People are not sitting and doing nothing. The past few years have taught us that it isn’t all plain sailing but the good news is that some people are learning how to take charge.” theartmarket.artbasel.com Find out about our latest stories first — follow @ftweekend on Twitter","04.04.2023"
"UBS/Credit Suisse: shotgun wedding aims to forestall contagion","This is a messy, ugly transaction that nobody really wants — but it’s also necessary","Credit Suisse may shortly be a historic footnote. Its capital buffers meant nothing to many depositors. They went on pulling funds even after the Swiss National Bank put up SFr50bn in extra liquidity. UBS is preparing to take the time bomb for the Swiss team. Pray the countdown will stop, stalling this bank run and any others incipient across Europe. The terms are humiliating to a Credit Suisse management team still talking a couple of days ago about its turnround plan. In its current form, this all-share takeover would be worth a paltry SFr0.75 a share (1 UBS share for 22.48 Credit Suisse shares), roughly SFr3bn ($3.3bn) in total. Credit Suisse shares closed at SFr1.86 on Friday after weeks of steep declines. The earlier loan backstop was doubled to SFr100bn. Assuming the deal comes off, no one can complain about banks privatising gains and socialising losses. The Swiss authorities are intent on railroading this transaction through. Shareholders might be robbed of the chance to vote on the transaction. Almost all of the Credit Suisse equity would be wiped out, though its senior creditors would feel comforted.   The rock bottom price would give UBS some protection from unforeseen liabilities. This deal, transacted to a conventional timetable in normal financial conditions, would look like a good one for UBS. Global wealth management is a scale game. On paper, UBS has around $4tn in client investment assets and Credit Suisse about $900bn. The latter figure will inevitably be lower in reality. The enlarged UBS would still be “Europe’s champion asset gatherer,” according to one M&A banker. The nominal takeover price is way below Credit Suisse’s year-end 2022 tangible book value of SFr41.8bn. That would create so-called negative goodwill (“badwill”), according to Autonomous analysts. Despite its name, this is a positive phenomenon. Over time, some or all of that amount could be written up in the combined banks, assuming that markets return to normal. UBS needs a cushion because some of Credit Suisse’s SFr35.3bn of common tier one capital buffer is questionable. On paper, the two banks have plenty of common tier one capital: over 14 per cent of risk weighted assets. At last month’s full-year results, Credit Suisse targeted a 13 per cent CET1 ratio by 2025. On current data, that suggests UBS needs a minimum of almost SFr33bn of CET1 capital to cover Credit Suisse. UBS may need to supplant some of what Credit Suisse has.  Restructuring expenses would eat into profits from the combined bank. Credit Suisse’s underlying expense base is about SFr7bn. Integrating Credit Suisse’s 50,000 plus full-time employees will be painful for both sides. Already, 9,000 of Credit Suisse jobs are expected to go. That number could double, causing political headaches in Switzerland.  The new UBS would have to prepare for a storm of potential litigation too. It is unclear whether the Swiss government is indemnifying the cost of this.  This is a messy, ugly transaction that nobody really wants. It also appears necessary. But whether it would halt European bank runs is unknowable. Reassurance is a dangerous game in a financial panic. It can as easily confirm the fears of investors as allay them. Broader action from central banks may still be required. The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

"UBS shares fall after Credit Suisse rescue deal","Analysts say the acquisition will distract the bank’s management and muddy its outlook  ","UBS shares tumbled more than 10 per cent in early trading on Monday after analysts warned that the Swiss bank’s rescue of rival Credit Suisse threatened to distract management and damage returns this year. Swiss regulators orchestrated the historic takeover at the weekend after outflows from Credit Suisse accelerated last week, deepening fears over the future of the country’s second-largest bank. Shares in UBS were down 13 per cent at SFr14.79. The all-share deal valued Credit Suisse at $3.25bn, less than half the bank’s market capitalisation at the close of trading on Friday.  “UBS has traditionally operated a high returning, high quality, stable franchise,” analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods noted. “The acquisition of Credit Suisse throws much of this into question, in our view.” While RBC analysts said that “the acquisition of CS by UBS seems attractive on paper longer term, we think this is unlikely to be the preferred route for UBS, but it appears to have been a necessary move not just for Swiss banks but the global banks sector overall”. The decline in UBS shares came as the deal failed to extinguish fears over the global banking sector, which was rocked by the sudden collapse earlier this month of California-based Silicon Valley Bank. As part of the deal, UBS secured a loss guarantee of up to SFr9bn ($9.8bn), but only after the bank had borne the first SFr5bn of losses on certain portfolios of Credit Suisse’s assets. As part of the deal, the Swiss National Bank also agreed to offer UBS a SFr100bn liquidity line. In a memo on Monday to UBS’s 74,000 staff, chief executive Ralph Hamers said Credit Suisse should be treated as a competitor until the deal has closed. “Please remember that, until this deal closes, Credit Suisse is still our competitor and we cannot discuss business matters with their employees or take any action that could be interpreted as a step toward the merging of business,” Hamers wrote. Swallowing up its smaller rival cements UBS’s position as the world’s largest wealth manager, with operations spanning the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The combined entity will have $5tn of invested assets globally.  UBS chair Colm Kelleher said on Sunday that UBS intended to keep Credit Suisse’s Swiss business, but it intended to shrink the group’s investment bank.  Hamers told staff in the memo that “bringing UBS and Credit Suisse together will build on UBS’s strengths and further enhance our ability to serve our clients globally, deepening our best-in-class capabilities”.

This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  Credit Suisse has revealed for the first time the scale at which depositors rushed to withdraw their money from the Swiss bank before it was forced to merge with rival UBS last month. In what is likely to be the final set of results as a stand-alone bank, Credit Suisse said it suffered outflows of SFr61bn ($68.6bn) in the first quarter as it reported a SFr1.3bn pre-tax loss for the period. The 167-year-old bank said the outflows had stabilised but not reversed, underlining the challenge confronting the management team at rival UBS as it sets about trying to integrate its former rival.  The $3.25bn takeover was the most significant banking deal since the financial crisis 15 years ago. UBS chair Colm Kelleher and new chief executive Sergio Ermotti have shortlisted four management consultants to help with the complex operation of merging the two banks, which is expected to take years and lead to thousands of job cuts.

"What the takeover of Credit Suisse means for UBS","Swiss banking group has plans for each unit of its defunct rival","Two days after UBS agreed to spend $3.25bn to rescue its rival Credit Suisse, executives are trying to move past the risks and sell investors on the benefits of the shotgun marriage. Chief executive Ralph Hamers told the Financial Times that the deal was “not simply about bringing two companies together” but about “how we can build a bigger UBS”.  The rescue, which will create the world’s fourth-largest bank by assets — with 120,000 staff and $5tn in assets under management — has raised concerns that it might be an unwelcome distraction for UBS executives.   Those executives, however, have stressed they were not forced into the deal and that it will boost the bank’s earnings per share by 2027 at the latest.  They have pointed to the low price they paid for a business that had a market capitalisation of $7.5bn last week, and to the SFr100bn ($108bn) of liquidity the Swiss government has committed as a backstop.  Wealth management With $3.4tn of wealth management assets, UBS would become the second-largest private bank in the world, just behind Morgan Stanley — or an “asset-gathering juggernaut”, as Andrew Coombs, analyst at Citigroup, wrote. The combined wealth business will be the biggest player in south-east Asia as well as the Middle East, and one of the leading managers in Latin America, helped by Credit Suisse’s Brazilian division.  The deal will have little benefit, however, for UBS’s ambition to grow in the US, since Credit Suisse exited the market in 2015. The combined business could lose some customers, analysts also note, who are clients of both lenders and would want to diversify their banking relationships.  In recent months, UBS has also been a refuge for fleeing Credit Suisse clients. Hamers said the bank received a surge of inflows last week, as nervy customers pulled their savings from Credit Suisse and other fragile banks.  “The inflows that we saw during . . . last week, they really demonstrate our status as a safe haven,” Hamers told analysts. But UBS will no longer be seen as an alternative to Credit Suisse, so wealthy clients could be tempted to look elsewhere. Fellow Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer, which has a strong business in Asia, is expected to be a beneficiary: its shares have jumped 13 per cent this week. JPMorgan analysts predict that the combined business would be most susceptible to withdrawals from ultra-rich clients — who make up 55 per cent of the wealth assets at both banks — as well as overlapping clients in Asia and Switzerland. The Swiss bank Credit Suisse’s most valuable asset was its domestic bank. Known internally as the “jewel in the crown”, analysts had estimated the business could fetch up to SFr15bn in a spin-off. In 2017 plans had been drawn up to list 25 per cent of the business, which is ringfenced from the rest of the group. Analysts expected its spin-off to be one condition of a UBS-Credit Suisse combination, given that the two lenders control about 30 per cent of the Swiss market. But so far, UBS has shown little appetite for shedding Credit Suisse’s domestic bank, finding its corporate banking particularly enticing.  One person involved in negotiating the rescue said he did not anticipate any antitrust problems in Switzerland.  “The government just pushed through emergency legislation to block shareholders from voting for this deal — do you really think they will care about anti-competition rules?” the person said. Should UBS hang on to the domestic business, many of the 17,000 jobs at Credit Suisse in Switzerland will be threatened once UBS closes branches and removes duplicate administrative roles. Asset management Combining UBS’s $1.1tn asset management business with Credit Suisse’s $400bn unit would create Europe’s third-biggest asset manager.  The two businesses complement one another, with UBS Asset Management more focused on active strategies designed for its wealthy clients, while the Credit Suisse business has a higher proportion of passive products and alternative funds. Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here Yet while a stronger investment arm helps UBS’s core business of looking after rich clients’ wealth, bringing the two businesses together brings risks. Credit Suisse’s investment arm was the source of one of its biggest scandals in recent years, when it was forced to close $10bn of investment funds tied to specialist finance firm Greensill Capital in 2021.  The collapse led to legal battles and tortuous insurance claims, as Credit Suisse tried to recoup its clients’ losses, which are expected to continue for years to come. Investment bank By far the most precarious of the Credit Suisse divisions is its investment bank, which was already being scaled back before the UBS deal.  For senior managers at UBS, it is the part of the business they see as the worst fit with their current strategy. It is also the unit from where most of Credit Suisse’s scandals and losses have emanated in recent years. UBS intends to wind down most of the investment bank and the government is offering to contribute SFr9bn to protect it against losses from doing so — once UBS has borne the first SFr5bn itself.  The wind-down will take place in Credit Suisse’s non-core unit, or “bad bank”, set up last year to offload unwanted assets. Anything the UBS management deems to be too risky and of little use to its wealth management business, including leverage finance and structured credit, will be wound down. Under the terms of the takeover, the combined investment bank will account for no more than a quarter of the group’s risk-weighted assets. Many of Credit Suisse’s 17,000 investment bankers could lose their jobs, according to people familiar with UBS management’s thinking. However, UBS may also look to sell certain parts of the business rather than wind them down. While the UBS leadership has little time for Credit Suisse’s sales and trading operations, its advisory arm does garner some interest, according to people involved in the planning. UBS managers believe advantages come with retaining bankers who specialise in growth areas such as pharmaceuticals, technology, media and telecoms, because the owners of the businesses could be persuaded to become wealth management clients.  All this casts doubt over Credit Suisse’s plan to spin off much of the investment bank under the CS First Boston brand and for it to be run by former board member Michael Klein. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that UBS was set to enter talks with Klein to unwind the deal. Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","22.03.2023"

So yesterday, they got their largest bank, UBS, to buy Credit Suisse for three and a quarter-billion dollars.

Credit Suisse has existed for 167 years, and now it is being subsumed in a panic weekend by its across the square rival in the very parochial Swiss kind of, you know, set-up of Zurich. Marc FilippinoSo, Arash, what did Swiss authorities do to broker the deal? Arash MassoudiAfter the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the Swiss central bank stepped in and provided a $54bn credit line that was designed to basically deal with the heavy levels of outflows that were coming from Credit Suisse. But it was clearly not enough. And there, not soon thereafter, UBS was instructed to begin working on a takeover. Marc FilippinoYeah, but why would UBS agree to buy Credit Suisse? I mean, Credit Suisse is, is just riddled with internal troubles. Was UBS just doing Swiss authorities a favour? Do they see any value in this? Arash MassoudiSo you could take a very long term view that one, there is some value here and you made a good deal because you’re picking up something that’s worth something from very cheap. And two, you know, you’re doing a solid for the Swiss government and therefore they’re gonna further have your back and probably doing a solid for the global financial system. So that would be the sort of bull case from UBS. UBS has been awaiting this phone call from the Swiss regulators and Swiss authorities for months. There was a period in October where people there was a panic around the Credit Suisse, and they began basically at that point preparing a playbook for what they would need to do with the inevitable 999 call that’s equal to our 911 here in the UK. The 999 call came in and this week and they basically have them opened that playbook. So that was the, that was essentially the situation with UBS.  Marc FilippinoIs there any concern that the Swiss National Bank over-reached, that they they went a little too far? Arash MassoudiAt this point, we need to be honest, which is that it is very likely that Credit Suisse was gonna be bankrupt if it opened up this week. The knock-on consequences of that bankruptcy probably would have had seismic impact on the global financial system. And so I think the Swiss, Swiss would take the view that — and I think it’s supported by the US and UK regulators — that they’ve dealt with this now. They’ve fended off what could have been a massive, massive scare in the financial system. Marc FilippinoAnd is there any sense of whether this will work to cap the contagion? Arash MassoudiIt’s too early to tell. Last week, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank went down. This week, Credit Suisse required a rescue. So we started in the US. Now we’re in Switzerland, and we’re gonna have to watch very carefully to see where it goes from here. But it is too early to make a call if we’re out of it. It certainly is not necessarily the mood music I’m hearing. Marc FilippinoArash Massoudi is the FT’s corporate finance and deals editor. He also edits our Due Diligence newsletter. We have a link to that in the show notes.  [MUSIC PLAYING] The Credit Suisse deal means big losses for its shareholders and bondholders. So just hours after the UBS merger was announced, several major central banks came out with a plan to improve US dollar liquidity. It’s to guard against additional stress in the markets. The group includes the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and central banks in England, Canada, Japan and Switzerland. They jointly agreed to make funding available via standing swap lines on a daily basis. Previously, this was done weekly. The central bankers said in a joint statement that the move will ease strains in global funding markets. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s take a look at the US, where the banking troubles all started, first with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, then Signature Bank. We’ve got First Republic teetering. Anyway, the Biden administration is trying to restore calm. It’s also under pressure to expand the US government’s guarantee on bank deposits. Currently, it insures up to $250,000. Here’s the FT’s Joshua Franklin with more. Joshua FranklinI don’t think you could underplay how big an impact that would have on banking. This would have potentially huge ramifications in terms of how people looked at the safety of banks, but also potentially how banks are run. Not to say that just because deposits are guaranteed that the banks would be, you know, overnight would go into even riskier casinos than some people already look at them as, as they are. But when you know you have a government guarantee across all of your deposits, that that will certainly have a big impact on how banks are run. Marc FilippinoNow we should be clear that any change is still far off. Right now, it’s largely political debate. Who in banking wants this? Joshua FranklinSo you’ve got a number of the bank lobby groups who have said that they would support this, especially lobby groups for the smaller and regional banks, which are coming under a lot of pressure with, with deposit outflows at the moment, because there’s been this big flight to quality for the bigger banks that are seen as, as being safer in the event of a, of a crisis. But the crucial thing to remember is the Biden administration on its own doesn’t have the unilateral power to lift the deposit insurance. That actually now requires an act of Congress. And that’s because of the Dodd-Frank Act coming out of the last financial crisis. Marc FilippinoYou mentioned deposit outflows and a flight to quality. That’s been another effect of this banking crisis. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Joshua FranklinYeah, no, there definitely has been this kind of so-called flight quality during this period. Because you look at the biggest banks, you know, the JPMorgan Chase’s, the Bank of America’s, the Wells Fargo’s — they’re deemed systemically important to the US economy and to the global economy. So there’s this feeling there’s this almost implicit government backed-guarantee of banks like this, that the government just wouldn’t allow these banks to fail. Is this how a lot of, a lot of customers and a lot of people look at these things. So they feel that they’re, you’re safe putting your money in there. So you’re, you’ve seen this kind of migration of money of deposits from the smaller banks to the bigger banks. And that’s definitely a trend that a lot of people do feel like is going to continue and exacerbate. And that leads onto this broader question that’s about the US market. And then in the US, you have, you know, around 4000 banks. And there’s this perennial question about whether or not the US actually needs all of these banks. And so this could be a scenario where that question is answered in a pretty meaningful way. Marc FilippinoJoshua Franklin is the FT’s US banking editor. [MUSIC PLAYING] The past two weeks have been a rude awakening for start-ups.  Andrew Edgecliffe-JohnsonWell, I spoke to one founder who told me we got our MBA in corporate banking. And I think there’s a very clear lesson here that you do not want all of your eggs in one basket. Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s US banking editor, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson. He’s been speaking to founders about the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Andrew Edgecliffe-JohnsonWhen the money’s flowing, you pay less attention to it. And this is a group of companies for whom the money has been flowing. The venture capital ecosystem has been flush with cash. They’ve been very eager to deploy it with these exciting new start-ups. And the exciting new start-ups have been very focused on other things, namely growth. They’ve not been thinking very much about risk and the usual balance in a company that grows more slowly is between that growth appetite and that consciousness of potential risks. And here the picture we’re getting of Silicon Valley and the start-ups around it is sort of that balance getting knocked off balance, essentially. Marc FilippinoEdge says venture capitalists are now advising the start-ups they work with on how to manage their cash. Andrew Edgecliffe-JohnsonSo what we’ve seen from some of the VC groups, big names like General Catalyst and Greylock, is they’re now saying you need to diversify your risk. You need to keep accounts with 2 to 3 separate banks at a time, including one of the big four banks like Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, that, you know, the government is gonna stand behind. So it’s a very fundamental piece of advice like that that we’re hearing from the venture capital community now. Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s US business editor, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.

"Why UBS brought Sergio Ermotti back as chief executive ","Swiss bank bets its former boss will do a better job of integrating Credit Suisse than Ralph Hamers would have","The day after agreeing to rescue Credit Suisse in the most significant banking deal since the financial crisis, UBS chair Colm Kelleher called Sergio Ermotti to see if he wanted his old job back. Kelleher had watched Ralph Hamers, who had succeeded Ermotti as UBS chief executive, fumbling questions from analysts at a hastily arranged call the night before. The performance had underscored concerns the board had over the Dutchman’s ability to oversee such a huge and complicated transaction.  Kelleher was also becoming spooked about the magnitude of the challenge UBS had taken on in striking the $3.25bn deal, which would create the world’s fourth-largest bank, with 120,000 staff and $5tn of assets under management.  The bank’s shareholders and regulators were also raising concerns, sharpening the appeal of bringing back Ermotti, who ran UBS for nine years before handing the reins to Hamers in 2020. On the call with Ermotti, the Monday after the deal was signed, Kelleher proposed that the 62-year-old return as chief executive and marshal the integration of Switzerland’s two biggest banks, in the first ever combination of two global systemically important financial institutions. The pair knew each other well and had spoken regularly about the plight of Credit Suisse for several months, but the call was the first time Ermotti’s return was officially discussed. They had dinner on Tuesday evening and six days later, on the following Monday, UBS’s board signed off on one of the most stunning corporate comebacks in recent years. “I cannot emphasise how big a deal this is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required,” Kelleher said of the Credit Suisse takeover on Wednesday as UBS announced Ermotti’s return. “It’s about having the best person in our opinion to effect the execution of this merger.”  While the decision to replace Hamers was taken quickly, his position as UBS chief had never seemed secure.  Hamers had been a surprise choice to replace Ermotti in late 2020, having spent the majority of his career at the smaller Dutch bank ING. His lack of experience in UBS’s two main business lines, investment banking and wealth management, was criticised by analysts and UBS staff.  But he was chosen by former chair Axel Weber to help cut costs and develop a stronger digital strategy for a bank whose roots stretch back 161 years. On the surface, Hamers’ time at the helm of UBS appeared a success, with the bank notching up record-breaking quarterly profits. Yet it took time for him to make his mark and it was more than a year into his tenure before he presented his grand vision for the bank. The plan, which was focused on developing UBS’s wealth management business in the US and Asia, was laden with references to tech initiatives. Much of the communication around the strategy was muddled by explanations of how the business would adapt to an “agile working” model. Critics derided Hamers’ strategy and his description of UBS as a “Netflix for wealth” in media interviews. A critical pillar of his strategy was the $1.4bn acquisition of US robo-adviser Wealthfront, the first time UBS had agreed a takeover since the financial crisis. But the start-up’s customers — mostly younger, digitally savvy savers — seemed an odd fit with the wealthier client base UBS was looking to attract in the US. By the time Kelleher replaced Weber as chair a year ago, the board and long-serving UBS staff were already starting to lose patience with Hamers, said several people with knowledge of internal discussions.  Kelleher initially took Hamers under his wing and attempted to brush up his communications skills. Hamers was banned from using his favourite buzzwords such as “purpose” and “ecosystems” in their weekly meetings together. The pair set about trying to convince international shareholders to invest and close UBS’s valuation gap on its US peers. Kelleher had been willing to give Hamers time to prove he was capable of leading the business and carrying out its growth strategy. But when UBS aborted the Wealthfront acquisition in September, questions began to be asked about Hamers’ authority within the bank. Hamers, who will remain at the bank as an adviser during a transition period, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By the turn of the year, when the situation at Zurich rival Credit Suisse was looking increasingly perilous, the UBS board stepped up plans for a potential rescue, anticipating that Swiss authorities would eventually ask them to move.  For UBS, Kelleher drove the takeover talks, with Hamers playing a supporting role, according to people involved in the negotiations.  After the takeover was announced on March 19, and while Kelleher was in discussions with Ermotti over his return, the bank’s senior management team started putting together a plan for integrating the two banks, a process that is expected to take several years. The task was handed to Mike Dargan, the bank’s chief digital and information officer, though other executives have been feeding into the process, said people with knowledge of the plans. Given the lack of experience of transformative M&A deals among the bank’s executive ranks, UBS invited consultancies to pitch for work on the takeover. “It’s a heavy lift, we don’t have the manpower internally so it will probably be worth a lot,” said a UBS executive involved in the planning. “Everyone will want it.” Senior managers have tried to persuade Hamers against granting McKinsey too big a role in the process because of the level of influence the 97-year-old consultancy has had over both banks in recent years, said people with knowledge of the talks.  Throughout his time in charge, Hamers had increasingly relied on McKinsey to help push through changes at the group. This rankled senior managers at the bank as well as board members, according to people involved in the discussions. Hamers had also served on McKinsey’s advisory council. For Ermotti, the chance to come back to UBS when it was taking over its fierce rival proved too good to turn down.  During his time at UBS, Ermotti had drawn up plans to acquire Credit Suisse “three or four times”, said two people familiar with his thinking. But discussions with the Credit Suisse board never progressed because they were not interested in a deal. After officially joining next Wednesday, Ermotti will take stock of the technical aspects of the deal before deciding if he needs to make changes to the executive board — including the possibility of bringing back other former UBS staff — or to the integration plans. “Coming back to manage this situation is a challenge, but also . . . I felt a call of duty,” Ermotti told journalists on Wednesday.  “I always felt that the next chapter [for UBS was] a transaction like this one. It would be a bit of a contradiction from me not to accept the job to execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”","29.03.2023"
"How the Swiss ‘trinity’ forced UBS to save Credit Suisse","The takeover of its local rival could end up being a generational boon for UBS. But the government-orchestrated deal has angered many investors","The emergency call from the Swiss establishment came at 4pm on Thursday. Colm Kelleher, a rambunctious Irish banking executive who has been chair of UBS since last April, had been planning to celebrate St Patrick’s Day on Friday before watching Ireland play England at rugby on Saturday at a pub in Zurich. He was hoping to see his country win a clean sweep, or “Grand Slam”, in the Six Nations Championship. But even before he took the call, he knew his chances of enjoying an entertaining weekend were slim. The chaos engulfing crosstown rival Credit Suisse, which had become the basket case of European banking after three scandal-ridden years, was now in overdrive.  A day earlier, a SFr50bn ($54bn) liquidity backstop from the Swiss central bank had failed to arrest a crisis of confidence in the lender, whose shares had plunged after Ammar Al Khudairy, the chair of its largest investor Saudi National Bank, bluntly replied “absolutely not” when asked if it would put in any more money. Global markets were already anxious after US regulators had seized control of Silicon Valley Bank following the withdrawal of $42bn of deposits in a single day. The same was happening at Credit Suisse. It was losing more than SFr10bn of wealthy clients’ money daily, adding to SFr111bn that had disappeared after a social-media rumour in October that it was on the verge of bankruptcy. “For the biggest investor to say I’m not putting another dime in was a huge vote of non-confidence. I could argue that had he not said anything we might have been in a very different situation,” says a person close to Credit Suisse’s top management. Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann, left, and UBS chair Colm Kelleher gather with Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter and Swiss president Alain Berset after talks on UBS taking over Credit Suisse © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images On Wednesday, the so-called “trinity” of the Swiss National Bank, regulator Finma and the minister of finance summoned Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann, who was in Saudi Arabia for a conference, and chief executive Ulrich Körner for a call. In the same meeting where they authorised the SFr50bn backstop, they also delivered another message: “You will merge with UBS and announce Sunday evening before Asia opens. This is not optional,” a person briefed on the conversation recalls. Kelleher found out his weekend plans were ruined on Thursday afternoon. The trinity called UBS and ordered the group to find a solution to save its ailing peer from bankruptcy.  “Resolution [a government-controlled wind-down] would have been a disaster for the financial system and introduced the threat of contagion around the world,” says another person involved on the UBS side. “Our interests were also aligned because a failure is not good for the Swiss wealth-management brand. So we said, on the right terms, we would help.” The takeover of its local rival could end up being a once-in-a-generation boon for UBS. But in exchange for taking on a bank wracked with litigation issues and billions of toxic assets, UBS was determined to extract the best deal that it could.  Ireland did win the Grand Slam on Saturday but Kelleher was limited to enjoying a single pint of Guinness at the James Joyce pub in Zurich. The following account is based on interviews with more than a dozen people involved in a frantic weekend of dealmaking that ended in a storied 167-year-old bank being subsumed into its fierce rival, wiping out certain junior bondholders and putting tens of thousands of jobs around the world in peril.  A merger between Zurich’s two largest banks has long been debated and rumoured. Tidjane Thiam, the former Credit Suisse chief executive, repeatedly told colleagues when he was in charge between 2015 to 2020 that it was “the only merger in European banking that makes sense”.  Until last week, the Swiss establishment had always been committed to a two-bank model. In 2008, it opted to rescue UBS with taxpayer money after it suffered dramatic losses in the financial crisis, rather than allow it to be acquired. However, public anger at that arrangement still endures today and a repeat was politically unthinkable.  “This is no bailout,” Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter stressed when the deal was announced on Sunday night. “This is a commercial solution.” Advisers and code names When both sides realised a deal was inevitable, they hired advisers. Credit Suisse has long retained Centerview, the investment bank led by Blair Effron who was assisted by Tadhg Flood, but Lehmann and Körner also recruited ex-UBS investment banker Piero Novelli to separately advise the board. Rothschild provided a further fairness opinion to directors. JPMorgan advised the UBS management team, while Morgan Stanley advised the UBS board. The acquirer gave each bank a tree-based code name: Credit Suisse was Cedar and UBS Ulmus, the Latin word for elm. Credit Suisse used different monikers: it referred to itself as Como while UBS was Geneva, after the lakes. By Thursday, we were all together in Zurich, and it was clear that the government was going to push one way or the other for a solution Through the process there was almost no direct contact between the two sides, an arrangement that increasingly infuriated those at Credit Suisse, who were intentionally kept in the dark about the price and terms of the takeover. Most interaction took place via intermediaries in the Swiss government or regulators over Zoom. “By Thursday, we were all together in Zurich, and it was clear that the government was going to push one way or the other for a solution by Monday morning, at all costs, to protect Swiss national interest, and banking interest more generally, on a global basis,” says the person close to Credit Suisse. Keller-Sutter, the finance minister, was a key figure throughout the negotiations, including co-ordinating with foreign officials and regulators in the US and Europe. She was under extreme pressure from global regulators, who had been demanding faster and more decisive action to stop panic spreading in markets. In particular, the US and the French were “kicking the shit out of the Swiss”, says one of the people advising UBS. Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary, had several conversations with Keller-Sutter over the weekend. Negotiations over the deal were initially “fairly friendly” but as time progressed the trinity started becoming more aggressive, pushing a transaction that Credit Suisse was vehemently opposed to. UBS was also reticent. Executives made it clear that it would only participate in the rescue of its rival if the price was cheap and it indemnified them from a raft of regulatory probes into Credit Suisse’s culture and controls.  “They [UBS] were always going to try to kill us on price. And we were always going to try to get a premium,” says a person close to Credit Suisse. By Friday evening, when it was revealed that UBS was exploring a state-mandated takeover, Credit Suisse had lost another SFr35bn in client deposits over the preceding three days, according to a banker involved in the deal, and international banks from BNP Paribas to HSBC were cutting ties. Regulators concluded that it would probably not be able to open on Monday. Another potential bidder, however, was waiting in the wings: Larry Fink’s BlackRock. The US firm’s chief executive had convened his inner circle on Thursday and told them a line he has used repeatedly: “To be in the game you’ve got to play it,” one person involved remembers. Swiss National Bank chair Thomas Jordan, left, and his team leave the Swiss Federal Department of Finance after weekend talks on the Credit Suisse crisis © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images During the financial crisis, BlackRock bought Barclays’s investment arm BGI in 2009 for $15.2bn, a transformational deal that made it the world’s biggest asset manager with $2.7tn of assets. Since then, it has grown to dominate the global investment industry and manage $8.6tn. It spied a similar opportunity in Credit Suisse’s troubles. A BlackRock team led by Rob Kapito, Fink’s second-in-command, flew immediately to Zurich and spent hours in a conference room studying various options. On Friday, Fink also turned to Bob Steel, vice-chair of Perella Weinberg Partners, who headed to Zurich.  BlackRock was open to a variety of options, including a partial acquisition or working with others. Such a scenario would potentially have made it easier for Michael Klein, the former Citigroup executive and Credit Suisse board member, to preserve an already arranged deal to merge his advisory boutique with and take control of the Swiss lender’s investment bank. “The most credible alternative was BlackRock . . . But it wasn’t what the Swiss government wanted,” says a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  By late Friday, BlackRock had indicated it did not want to buy the entire bank. Credit Suisse responded by proposing a minority investment, including some kind of wealth management partnership. BlackRock ultimately decided to halt its work on a bid.  “Fink wasn’t really in the mood to piss off UBS as it’s one of his biggest customers. So I always thought that at some point, he was going to not be there. He would have to deal with US regulators, which was a tough thing,” says a person close to Credit Suisse. You make fun of dictatorships and then you can change the law over the weekend. What’s the difference between Saudi Arabia and Switzerland now? Negotiations continued throughout Saturday, with global regulators keen to sign off on the structure of a deal in principle by that evening. Deadlines kept being pushed back as officials scrambled to find the right change of control documentation. Also slowing down progress was a problem with UBS’s email system, which meant messages were taking a long time to go through. Frazzled supervisors told them instead to pick up the phone. Growing frustrated with the lack of communication from UBS, Lehmann decided he would write a letter instead to Kelleher and the Swiss authorities. Drafted by general counsel Markus Diethelm — who had joined from UBS in June — it was delivered on Saturday evening and contained a number of reasons for why the planned transaction was unacceptable.  These included the insistence by UBS for walkaway provisions, including a material adverse change clause linked to a spike in its credit default swap spreads. Lehmann’s communique also carried a threat. He wrote that Credit Suisse’s three biggest shareholders — including two from Saudi Arabia and one from Qatar — had expressed their “extreme discomfort” with the opacity of the deal. They demanded to see a fair price, a vote on the deal and that any get-out clauses be removed. The letter also noted that the Saudis and Qataris were large clients of both banks. In response, on Saturday evening Kelleher called his counterpart at Credit Suisse from outside a restaurant to tell him UBS was prepared to offer $1bn in stock for the whole group, about SFr0.25 a share, far below the SFr1.86 closing price on Friday. The government then informed Credit Suisse it would introduce emergency legislation to strip both sets of shareholders of the right to vote on the deal. Credit Suisse was outraged and refused to sign. It was opposed to the CDS clause because the optionality of walking away from the deal would have killed it once it was made public. Such a condition would have led to chaos, say people with direct knowledge of the negotiations. Its Middle Eastern shareholders were also incensed. “You make fun of dictatorships and then you can change the law over the weekend. What’s the difference between Saudi Arabia and Switzerland now? It’s really bad,” says one person close to one of the three major shareholders.  On Sunday morning, when the terms of the $1bn offer were revealed in the FT, the person said it was greeted in the region with “disbelief”. Ramping up the pressure Under pressure to get a deal done before the end of the day, the trinity started to ramp up pressure on both sides, threatening to remove the Credit Suisse board if they did not sign off. On the other side, UBS was lent on to increase its price and reluctantly agreed, ultimately boosting the offer to $3.25bn in stock. But in return it negotiated more support from the state, including a SFr100bn liquidity line from the SNB and a government loss guarantee of up to SFr9bn, after it had borne the first SFr5bn itself. At one point, both sides had hardly met face to face, despite their offices essentially facing each other across Zurich’s Paradeplatz square © Michael Bulhozer/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The final terms were still so favourable to UBS they were “an offer we couldn’t refuse”, a person on the negotiating team told the FT. An adviser to Credit Suisse described them as “unacceptable and outrageous” and a “total disregard of corporate governance and shareholder rights”. At this point, both sides had hardly met face to face, despite their offices essentially facing each other across Zurich’s Paradeplatz square. In order to make the deal more palatable for Swiss citizens and the bank’s equity investors, the government also decided to impose losses on SFr16bn of Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 (AT1) capital bonds. While these are designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble, normally they are not triggered if shareholders receive money as part of a takeover. However, the small print of the bond documentation allowed Swiss authorities to disregard the normal order of priority and wipe out bondholders.  “AT1 holders were sacrificed so the finance ministry could try to save some face with international equity holders after denying them a vote on either side of the transaction,” says one of the bankers advising on the takeover. The details were hammered out so fast, UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers was unable to answer analysts’ questions about the treatment of Credit Suisse’s debt at a presentation later on Sunday night after the announcement. “We will have to come back to you,” he told the assembled analysts. Credit Suisse’s board pored over the details of the final proposal and, after a quick consultation with its advisers, informed the trinity that it would accept UBS’s $3.25bn offer.  When Keller-Sutter was informed that the deal would indeed go through before the Asian markets opened, the finance minister breathed a sigh of relief, say people briefed about the matter, releasing days of tension over the future of the Swiss and global financial system. Kelleher, clockwise from centre left, talks with Finma chair Marlene Amstad, Berset, Keller-Sutter, Jordan and Lehmann in front of the press in Bern on Sunday  © Peter Klaunzer/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock A press conference was hastily convened in Bern, where the trinity was joined by the chairs of UBS and Credit Suisse on stage to present a historic deal.  “The failure of a systemically relevant bank would have had severe repercussions,” said Keller-Sutter. “Switzerland needs to be aware of its own responsibility beyond its own borders.” Next to her on stage, Credit Suisse’s Lehmann was asked, “Who is responsible for this disaster?” He chose to blame Twitter. “Hindsight is wonderful, and to point a finger — it’s a fact that since 2021 . . . we never left the headlines,” he responded. “Last autumn we had a social media storm and this had huge repercussions — more in the retail sector than in the wholesale sector. And too much becomes too much.” Kelleher was more blunt.  “It’s a historic day, and a day we hoped would not come,” he said. “This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue.” Additional reporting by Owen Walker, Brooke Masters, Laura Noonan and Robert Smith Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"The Jeffrey Epstein legal vortex grips finance and politics","Plus, UBS wades through Credit Suisse litigation and companies face higher borrowing costs","One fun thing to start: Masayoshi Son is back!

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Lawsuits reveal Jeffrey Epstein tiesUBS inherits Greensill/SoftBank woesPrivate equity’s refinancing cliff arrives Top UK officials get dragged into Epstein saga The late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s reach into the world of finance and politics seems to get wider by the week.  Further light has been shed on the deep ties Epstein had to JPMorgan Chase and its former top executive Jes Staley who would later lead Barclays. JPMorgan last week paid $290mn to settle one of two bombshell lawsuits against the bank, which alleged that in its 15-year relationship with Epstein it had profited from human trafficking by ignoring multiple internal warnings about their former client’s sex crimes. The agreement came just hours after a federal judge ruled that the case, originally brought by a single Epstein accuser, would be widened to include dozens of women who claim to also have been abused by the late paedophile. JPMorgan faces similar allegations in a separate legal challenge from the US Virgin Islands. The bank is now suing Staley in an effort to make him liable for damages it may face over the Epstein claims. Staley denies liability. This week came another wrinkle. In a 22-page report compiled by JPMorgan following Epstein’s arrest in 2019 and filed to a New York court, the Wall Street lender revealed that he had offered to connect Staley with Alistair Darling, who was UK chancellor at the time, and former business secretary Peter Mandelson to whom he referred to as “Petie”. Peter Mandelson, left, and Jeffrey Epstein, right, celebrating a birthday at Epstein’s Paris apartment in January 2007  © The Sun/News Licensing It has dragged two officials who helped guide the UK’s response to the financial crisis into Epstein’s orbit.  The bank’s investigation — codenamed Project Jeep — went on to refer to various meetings and conversations between Epstein and Mandelson, including one at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2010. It also suggests that Mandelson stayed at Epstein’s lavish townhouse on Manhattan’s Upper East Side in June 2009 while he was the UK business secretary and the financier himself was in prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.  Mandelson has refused to either confirm or deny the stay and a person close to Mandelson said his association with the financier was principally through his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, now serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring to sexually abuse minors. While there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by either Mandelson or Darling in the dossier, it shows how Epstein touted his supposed influence.  UBS caught between a rock and a hard place It may only have been just over a week since UBS completed the takeover of its longtime rival Credit Suisse, but executives are already having to deal with the tortuous conflicts of interest that the deal presents. Lawyers for UBS have begun sifting through the mountains of paperwork that support Credit Suisse in the legion of outstanding lawsuits — deciding which cases have merit and which could damage UBS’s business interests and reputation.  Top of the pile is the current London High Court case brought by Credit Suisse against its former client SoftBank in relation to a $440mn debt connected to bust finance company Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse has alleged that SoftBank masterminded a financial restructuring of Katerra — a Californian construction company funded by SoftBank’s Vision Fund that was also a client of Greensill — that benefited the Japanese group at the expense of the Swiss bank’s clients. The lawsuit centres on $440mn owed to the Swiss bank’s customers by Katerra, which went bankrupt following the collapse of Greensill. Katerra had received the money via Credit Suisse’s supply-chain finance funds. Late in 2020, SoftBank agreed to provide an emergency cash injection into Greensill, which was intended to cover the debts at Katerra. DD readers may recall an FT story from 2021 that revealed the money never reached the Credit Suisse funds. The problem with the lawsuit for UBS’s top lawyers, however, is that SoftBank is still very much a client of its investment bank, two people familiar with the matter told the FT’s Owen Walker. UBS therefore needs to consider whether it continues to pursue the case and risk losing a plum investment banking client, or abort it and risk upsetting the wealthy clients it has just picked up from Credit Suisse whose money was invested in the Greensill funds. DD wonders whether UBS lawyers will be equally as conflicted when deciding whether to continue with Credit Suisse’s lawsuit against Zurich finance blog Inside Paradeplatz. A quirk in CLOs starts to bite private equity The slowdown in Wall Street’s lucrative CLO machine is starting to pinch corporate America. Companies have been hit by shifts in the market for so-called collateralised loan obligations, the biggest buyers in the $1.4tn leveraged loan market. A loan extension for California utility PG&E was shelved last month. Separately two KKR-backed businesses — Heartland Dental, a provider of services to dentists’ offices, and digital media business Internet Brands — had to pay lenders more or agree to tougher investor protections in return for getting their loan maturities pushed back, people with knowledge of the matter told DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Harriet Clarfelt. The issue for borrowers isn’t just the drop-off in the issuance of new CLOs though. A growing number of existing CLOs are hitting limits that curtail their ability to invest in new loans. That’s not a design flaw for what it’s worth, but a mechanism to protect a CLO’s investors. As demand for new loans begins to sag — Bank of America estimates by the end of the year roughly 40 per cent of CLOs will exit so-called reinvestment periods — borrowing costs for companies are being pushed up. “When a company has to find new lenders . . . that probably has an impact on the cost of capital because you have to make it interesting for new lenders,” said Rob Zable, the global head of Blackstone’s liquid credit strategies.

"Majority of Swiss want new UBS-Credit Suisse mega bank split up","Results of poll add momentum to calls for a review of the forced merger and for the clawing back of bonuses","More than three-quarters of Swiss voters want the combined mega bank created by UBS’s emergency takeover of rival Credit Suisse to be split up by new legislation.  A poll published on Friday evening by the country’s biggest pollster, GfsBern, adds momentum to calls in Switzerland for a review of the deal, its possible reversal, and even laws to permanently clawback bonuses from Credit Suisse employees for the benefit of taxpayers.  The country’s three biggest political parties have this week expressed deep reservations about the rescue — which was brokered last weekend by the Swiss Federal Council, the country’s seven-person executive.   Switzerland’s parliament — which only sits every few months — is due to convene for an emergency session in April. The Federal Council is likely to face a political storm when it does.  The country’s biggest political party, the rightwing populist SVP, which controls a quarter of the seats in parliament, has said it will veto extending liquidity support for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss National Bank if the government does not commit to a break-up of the entity and measures to claw back bonuses from Credit Suisse bankers.  The second-largest party, the leftwing Social Democrats, has said it will demand new banking legislation. “Tough measures will be on the table,” the party has promised its supporters. “Laws must be made that end the culture of irresponsibility.” Even the pro-business conservative FDP, the third-largest party, has called for a crackdown. The party said Credit Suisse’s domestic bank should be separated from UBS as soon as the merger has been settled and markets have calmed.  “A UBS with a balance sheet total of SFr1.5tn is too big for Switzerland,” the party said.  Its stance is particularly awkward because Switzerland’s finance minister, Karin Keller-Sutter — a key figure who made the merger happen — is an FDP member.   The poll found 83 per cent of voters “strongly” agreed that Credit Suisse’s management should be “held accountable”, with 71 per cent strongly agreeing that profits should not stay private while taxpayer money was involved. Forty-seven per cent of respondents strongly agreed with the statement: “UBS is now too big. It should be split up because of the risks,” while 32 per cent said they agreed.  A similar number said investment banking should be permanently split from deposit-taking activities: 47 per cent strongly agreed with bringing forward new laws to do so, with 31 per cent saying they agreed. A majority of respondents also felt that the Swiss government had overstepped the mark in using emergency powers to wipe out some bondholders, a measure that has caused outrage among overseas investors, and sidelined shareholders. Just over half of those surveyed — 52 per cent — said they would support a national referendum on the government’s emergency decree.  Under Switzerland’s direct democracy model, just 100,000 signatures would be needed to trigger a national referendum, the outcome of which would be constitutionally binding. ","24.03.2023"
"UBS in talks to acquire Credit Suisse","Swiss authorities press for merger to stem crisis of confidence in country’s banking sector","UBS is in discussions to take over all or part of Credit Suisse, with the boards of Switzerland’s two biggest lenders set to meet separately over the weekend to consider what would be Europe’s most consequential banking combination since the financial crisis, according to multiple people briefed on the talks. The Swiss National Bank and regulator Finma are orchestrating the negotiations in an attempt to shore up confidence in the country’s banking sector, the people said. Their intervention comes days after the central bank was forced to provide an emergency SFr50bn ($54bn) credit line to Credit Suisse. However, this failed to arrest a slide in its share price, which has fallen to record lows after its largest investor ruled out providing any more capital and its chair admitted that an exodus of wealth management clients had continued.  The share price performance of the Swiss lenders has diverged significantly in recent years. Over the past three years, UBS shares have gained about 120 per cent while those of its smaller rival have plunged roughly 70 per cent. The former has a market capitalisation of $56.6bn, while Credit Suisse closed on Friday with a value of $8bn. In 2022, UBS generated $7.6bn of profit, whereas Credit Suisse made a $7.9bn loss, effectively wiping out the entire previous decade’s earnings. Swiss regulators told their US and UK counterparts on Friday evening that merging the two banks was “plan A” to arrest a collapse in investor confidence in Credit Suisse, one of the people said.  A number of options beyond a full takeover are under discussion, another person said, adding that both sides are trying to evaluate regulatory constraints in different jurisdictions. This person added that UBS is also analysing the potential risks of a deal. The Swiss central bank wants the lenders to agree on a simple and straightforward solution before markets open on Monday, one of the people said. There is no guarantee a deal, which would need to be approved by UBS shareholders, will be reached. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment, as did the Swiss National Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.  A full merger would create one of the biggest global systemically important financial institutions in Europe. UBS has $1.1tn of total assets on its balance sheet and Credit Suisse has $575bn. However, such a large deal may prove too unwieldy to execute. The Financial Times has previously reported that other options under consideration include breaking up Credit Suisse and raising funds via a public offering of its ringfenced Swiss division, with the wealth and asset management units being sold to UBS or other bidders. UBS has been on high alert for an emergency rescue call from the Swiss government after investors grew wary of Credit Suisse’s most recent restructuring. Last year, chief executive Ulrich Körner announced a plan to cut 9,000 jobs and spin off much of its investment bank into a new entity called First Boston, run by former board member Michael Klein. A potential takeover by its biggest rival would cap almost three years of scandal and chaos at 167-year-old Credit Suisse. Twin crises linked to specialist finance group Greensill Capital and family office Archegos — which both collapsed in the space of a few weeks in 2021 — resulted in billions of dollars of losses. The lender was also fined for its role in the $2bn Mozambique “tuna bonds” scandal and was the first Swiss bank to be found guilty of a corporate crime after it was discovered to have laundered money for a Bulgarian cocaine cartel run by a former professional wrestler. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse has suffered from significant management turnover. Former chief executive Tidjane Thiam resigned in 2020 after a spying scandal and neighbourhood dispute with a subordinate that scandalised Zurich.  A year later, António Horta-Osório was installed as chair. The former Lloyds Bank boss was brought in to clean up the Swiss lender’s culture. He was forced out in early 2022 for excessive use of the corporate jet and for breaching Covid-19 quarantine rules to watch the European Football Championship final and Wimbledon men’s tennis final in the same day.

"Credit Suisse suffered $69bn in outflows during first-quarter crisis","Results expose scale of task for UBS after state-orchestrated rescue to take over Swiss rival","Credit Suisse suffered SFr61.2bn ($68.6bn) of outflows in the first quarter as clients fled the stricken bank, exposing the scale of the task for UBS after taking over its Swiss rival. The client exodus was most acute in the days before Swiss regulators orchestrated the rescue by UBS last month, Credit Suisse said on Monday, adding that while outflows had stabilised, they had not reversed. The revelations of the scale at which customers fled the bank are the first since the takeover deal was struck, underlining the damage inflicted on the business that forced Swiss regulators to step in.  Credit Suisse’s flagship wealth management unit lost 9 per cent of assets in the first quarter, a haemorrhaging that will cut the fees it generates and “likely lead to a substantial loss in wealth management” in the second quarter, Credit Suisse said as it released first-quarter results. The $3.25bn takeover of Credit Suisse is the first time two global systemically important financial institutions have been brought together since the crisis of 2008-09 and it carries significant integration risks for UBS.  Analysts have predicted that both banks could lose customers, especially wealthy ones who have accounts at each institution and now want to diversify. “The magnitude of losses and outflows is alarming,” said Thomas Hallett, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, on Monday. “There is more to come. Simply put, even if UBS is able to take out SFr8bn of costs by 2027, the revenue trajectory is so damaged that the deal could well remain a drag on UBS operating results unless a deeper restructuring plan is announced,” he added. Credit Suisse reported an adjusted SFr1.3bn pre-tax loss for the quarter. It reported net income of SFr12.4bn for the quarter, a figure flattered by a SFr15bn accounting gain stemming from the controversial wipeout of some Credit Suisse bondholders as part of the rescue. Holders of additional tier one capital notes — a debt instrument that can convert into equity — that have been hit have filed a lawsuit against Switzerland’s banking regulator, Finma, over the decision. It is expected to be the first of several claims over the next few years.  The move has temporarily boosted Credit Suisse’s common equity tier one ratio — an indicator of its financial resilience — from 14.1 per cent to 20.3 per cent. “In light of the merger announcement, the adverse revenue impact from the previously disclosed exit from non-core businesses and exposures, restructuring charges and funding costs, Credit Suisse would also expect the investment bank and the group to report a substantial loss before taxes in [the second quarter] and 2023,” the bank said. Credit Suisse also confirmed it had terminated its $175mn acquisition of M Klein & Co, the advisory business run by the bank’s former director Michael Klein. The deal had been structured as part of a plan for Credit Suisse to spin off much of its investment bank under the First Boston brand and be run by Klein. Separately, UBS said on Monday that Christian Bluhm, its chief risk officer who had announced he was standing down to become a full-time photographer, would instead stay in the role “for the foreseeable future” to help with the integration of Credit Suisse. UBS reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday morning.","24.04.2023"
"Tens of thousands of jobs at risk after UBS takeover of Credit Suisse","Domestic Swiss business and investment bank set to bear brunt of cuts","UBS’s rescue of Credit Suisse is expected to result in tens of thousands of job cuts, with Switzerland’s financial sector already bracing itself for a heavy hit from the contentious takeover. Credit Suisse’s domestic business and its investment bank, which collectively employ more than 30,000 staff, are expected to bear the brunt of the cuts, according to people familiar with UBS’s plans. These people added that it was too early to quantify how many roles would go, but it could be as much as a third of the 120,000 jobs in the combined group, as UBS winds down much of the investment bank and removes overlapping roles in Switzerland.  “The takeover threatens job cuts on a scale that the labour market in the banking sector cannot absorb,” said the Swiss Bank Employees’ Association on Tuesday, calling for redundancies to be paused until the end of the year.  The deal was orchestrated by the Swiss authorities over the weekend after they became alarmed at the rate of customer withdrawals Credit Suisse was suffering last week. The SFr3bn ($3.25bn) deal has been criticised for the losses incurred by bondholders and the lack of a shareholder vote on the union. Credit Suisse, which at the end of 2022 employed just over 50,000 people, was already in the middle of a wide-ranging job-cutting drive, with 4,000 positions slashed so far this year. But the takeover is expected to result in many of Credit Suisse’s 17,000 investment bankers losing their jobs as UBS winds down most of the unit. UBS, which employs 74,000 staff globally, will also look to remove overlapping Credit Suisse roles in Switzerland, close branches and reduce staff in administrative positions, according to people with knowledge of the plans. In a call with analysts on Sunday night following the announcement of the deal, UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers said they would try to remove $8bn of costs a year by 2027, with $6bn coming from a reduction in staff and $2bn on IT spending.  Credit Suisse spent SFr8.8bn on staffing costs last year. In a staff memo on Monday, Credit Suisse chief executive Ulrich Körner and chair Axel Lehmann said any decisions over jobs had yet to be made. “We [will] work diligently and at pace throughout the coming period to identify which roles might be impacted,” they said. “Where necessary, we will communicate with impacted individuals in line with country specific guidelines and policies.” The takeover is set to complete in the second half of the year. Ethos Foundation, which represents Swiss institutional investors that collectively own between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of both banks, said it was pressing Swiss authorities and UBS to spin off Credit Suisse’s domestic business, which employs just under 17,000 people. “This would preserve jobs and maintain a healthy competition, which would ensure the proper functioning of our economy,” said Ethos.  Separately, the Swiss Bank Employees Association has called on Credit Suisse’s management team to set up a task force to manage the risk of mass job cuts. “There is an enormous amount at stake for the 17,000 or so employees of Credit Suisse in Switzerland — and thus also for our national economy,” it said.

"Culture clash: the challenge of uniting fierce rivals UBS and Credit Suisse","Investment banking is at the heart of divisions between the two Swiss lenders","It took just 72 hours for Swiss regulators to fast-track a $3.25bn rescue of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS. Now executives at the two banks face a painful few years as they integrate the businesses. Thousands of jobs will be lost, entire data systems transferred and tens of billions of dollars’ worth of assets wound down. But insiders said the biggest fear within UBS was how to protect its carefully restored values from what one senior figure at the bank described as a “rancid” culture in parts of Credit Suisse. “Where we find evidence of bad culture, examples will be made ‘pour encourager les autres,’” said a second senior UBS figure, referring to the French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who coined the phrase. Credit Suisse will be made to adjust to UBS’s way of doing things, not the other way round.   Culture can be an asset to an organisation, but it can also be a risk. It dictates how employees interact with each other and clients, the decisions they make and what priorities a business has — all of which affect financial performance. From the board and executive team to compliance, risk and ethics functions, everyone has a part to play.  Thomas Roulet, an associate professor at the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School, said corporate culture can explain “competitive advantage” within industries. But when two companies cannot align after a deal, it is dangerous. “There might be so much divergence they cannot agree on the way forward, and there is clear animosity to the point the two [sides] spend their energy trying to get rid of each other rather than paving a route forward for the merged group.” Before the 2008 financial crisis, the two big Swiss banks were both viewed as fairly hard-charging institutions. But after UBS was bailed out by the state and became caught up in scandals including a highly sensitive US tax dispute and $2bn of losses by a rogue trader, it changed course. The bank curtailed its racier activities, cleaned itself up and rebuilt as a more conservative wealth manager. Credit Suisse, which did not have to be rescued in 2008 and is known for its leveraged financing business, only pushed harder into classic big-risk, big-reward investment banking, hiring aggressively and expanding fast. UBS chair Colm Kelleher, right, extends a hand to Credit Suisse’s Axel Lehmann © Denis Balibouse/Reuters One dealmaker who spent years working at both institutions said this division was at the heart of the culture clash and difference in how the banks’ staff behaved. “UBS has always been a very friendly, collegial, team-oriented culture. When I say friendly, I mean, they actually like each other . . . Investment banking was never a part of the DNA of UBS,” he said.  “Credit Suisse might be the opposite in that each individual was very sharp-elbowed. Basically at Credit Suisse you were told to take advantage of the balance sheet and got paid a massive bonus, that was the game. And it was the game for 30 years. And there was no sense of being in it together,” he added. One former UBS employee said investment banking was viewed akin to gambling inside the lender. Credit Suisse’s domestic bank is considered attractive, but for a “not flashy, keep your head down” culture such as UBS’s, the asset management arm and investment banking division are more problematic.  When news circulated last week that the Swiss regulators had pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse, a group of the company’s investment bankers and their clients were in a corporate box at the John Mayer concert in Madison Square Garden in New York. The bankers “started high-fiving”, according to one person present. The 160-year old UBS, which has taken a long time to feel secure about its current business culture, now has to carefully weave in the riskier parts of Credit Suisse’s operations.  At the press conference announcing the deal, UBS chair Colm Kelleher made a pointed remark, saying the bank would curtail Credit Suisse’s investment bank where the losses have escalated, to align it more with “our conservative risk culture”.  The most immediate consequence for staff — as with any big takeover — will be job losses. Headhunters said Credit Suisse employees were already on the frantic hunt for new positions, with tens of thousands likely to be sacked.  Those that stay will have to adapt. UBS will assign teams to go through Credit Suisse HR files for “evidence of cultural slippage”, said one of the senior figures at the bank. A priority will be identifying those who have committed regulatory infractions, people who are heavily motivated by pay and are “holding the firm to ransom” and those who were forgiven for past transgressions or dealt with “softly”. This behaviour will be “rooted out”, he said.   Timothy Galpin, senior lecturer of strategy and innovation at Saïd Business School, said culture mismanagement could cause “heartburn” after a deal, even with two willing participants, let alone those hastily forced together.  “I predict there will be a lot of problems,” he said. “UBS is not acquiring a small regional bank where you absorb a few retail branches. This is a much bigger organisation so everything will have to be negotiated.” He added that senior UBS executives would need to ensure they had a firm grip on a series of levers including corporate values, recruitment, communication strategies, pay and the organisational structure. “Everything is happening at an incredible pace. They are changing the tyres while going 60 miles an hour down the road. Assessment, planning and implementation is happening on an iterative basis and doing all this simultaneously and at pace, will mean it is chaotic unless it is managed tightly,” he said.  Prior examples of banking deals in times of crisis can provide lessons for Swiss regulators and executives. While the Chase acquisition of JPMorgan can be regarded as a success — where both businesses retained their own identities and clientele, the JPMorgan 2008 transaction for Bear Stearns is viewed differently by some. “Their [Bear Stearns’] best people went off and created Guggenheim Partners, and other key people from Bear Stearns went elsewhere,” said one top M&A lawyer.  Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch in 2008 is another example where cultures clashed. “Merrill Lynch was always very much the old line broker-dealer, investment banker, they were not commercial bankers at all. Bank of America was very much a commercial bank.” Again the result, the lawyer said, was that some of Merrill Lynch’s best people left. He added that acquiring a financial institution was unlike other companies as assets were “illusory”. Customers can move their deposits and their business elsewhere rapidly. “To sum it up: liabilities stay, assets and people move. That’s really the risk when you’re taking over a failed or failing institution.” UBS has made clear it is on the offensive and is loath to allow in forces that could disrupt a delicate and hard won equilibrium. “UBS will not risk its own future or culture after all the tough times it went through,” said Chris Roebuck, a former UBS employee who was tasked with helping to integrate the company in the years after the 1998 merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation.  “This is a forced marriage by the regulators to avoid a disaster and now everybody at UBS is going ‘oh my god’. How do we make this work in a way that is financially viable, culturally viable and does not kill off UBS?” Additional reporting by Ortenca Aliaj in New York  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"Credit Suisse promises to pay bonuses to staff despite UBS rescue","Swiss bank had SFr360mn of contingent capital awards outstanding at the end of 2022","Credit Suisse has told staff that it will continue to hand out bonuses and pay rises as planned this year, despite the bank having to be rescued by UBS in a SFr3bn ($3.25bn) deal over the weekend. Shortly after the Swiss lender was saved from bankruptcy on Sunday night, chair Axel Lehmann and chief executive Ulrich Körner reassured employees in a memo that they would still be paid on Friday. “We will pay salary and bonus, where outstanding, as per the previously communicated schedule . . . [and] we will continue to allocate for a 2023 performance bonus for those eligible,” the pair said in an internal email seen by the Financial Times. “We will continue to honour our obligations and already communicated salary increases will still be effective from April 2023.  “It remains critically important that you continue to come to the office or work according to your agreed pattern,” the memo added. The takeover by UBS is not expected to fully complete until the end of 2023. Nevertheless, staff are set to lose significant sums as a result of the merger, which was done at a fraction of the value of Credit Suisse’s stock price last Friday and wiped out $17bn of the failed bank’s additional tier 1 (AT1) debt.  AT1 bonds, which are a form so-called contingent convertible security, and shares made up part of employees’ deferred pay, according to people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse’s annual report shows that it had SFr360mn of contingent capital awards, SFr565mn of share awards and SFr123mn of performance share awards outstanding at the end of 2022. It is not clear how much of the contingent capital was made up of AT1 debt. The memo from Lehmann and Körner also promised to honour Credit Suisse’s “upfront cash awards” programme, introduced in 2022 in an attempt to slow an exodus of top staff to rivals as the Swiss lender’s prospects dimmed. Under the scheme, directors and managing directors earning more than $250,000 were paid a larger proportion of their bonuses immediately in cash, reducing the amount paid in deferred stock. However, they would have to give back some of the money if they left within three years.  Despite the reassurances, further down the memo Lehmann and Körner warned that the Swiss Federal Council retained the right to “wholly or partially restrict” bonuses as they see fit, as well as adjust overall remuneration policy. UBS declined to comment on its plans regarding Credit Suisse staff bonuses in general or the upfront cash awards. Typically, bonuses at Credit Suisse have comprised three elements: a cash proportion paid immediately, a share award that can be sold after one year and a deferred stock element that can only be cashed in over a number of years — and is subject to forfeit if an employee departs. Unvested deferred Credit Suisse stock awards will be converted into that of the new company at the rate specified by the merger agreement — one share in UBS for 22.48 shares in Credit Suisse — the memo read. “We know that many of you will have been following the intense media coverage over the past 48 hours on the future of Credit Suisse and appreciate the enormous uncertainty and stress that this has caused,” the chair and chief executive said in the email. Regarding job cuts, managers said they would “work diligently and at pace” to inform staff and “aim to continue to provide severance in line with market practice”. UBS chair Colm Kelleher has said that he “intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business” so that it accounted for no more than 25 per cent of the group’s risk weighted assets” and “align it with our conservative risk culture”.  Additionally, a plan to spin off the advisory and capital markets operations with the First Boston brand under the leadership of Michael Klein will be reviewed and could be cancelled, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The Swiss regulator Finma has given UBS the right to block any material changes at Credit Suisse until it is fully in control of its rival. Credit Suisse’s flagship Asian investment conference is expected to go ahead this week in Hong Kong despite the takeover. However, the bank has rescinded all media invitations and limited attendance to clients in order to ensure “a smooth transition and seamless experience for them”.

"Switzerland prepares emergency measures to deliver UBS takeover of Credit Suisse","Daily deposit outflows at troubled Swiss bank topped SFr10bn last week as fears for its health mounted","Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the takeover by UBS of Credit Suisse, according to three people familiar with the situation, as the banks and their regulators rush to seal a merger deal before markets open on Monday.  Under Swiss rules, UBS would typically have to give shareholders six weeks to consult on the acquisition, which would combine Switzerland’s two biggest lenders.  Three people briefed on the situation said UBS had indicated that emergency measures would be used so that it could skip the consultation period and pass the deal without a shareholder vote. The details are still being worked out, one of the people said.   Switzerland’s regulator Finma did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Swiss central bank, Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment.  The Swiss National Bank and regulator Finma have told international counterparts that they regard a deal with UBS as the only option to arrest a collapse in confidence in Credit Suisse and were working to reach regulatory agreement by Saturday night. UBS has said it will continue with Credit Suisse’s plans to shrink its investment bank, so that the combined entity will make up no more than a third of the merged group, two of the people said.  The Swiss cabinet met for an emergency meeting on Saturday evening to discuss the future of Credit Suisse. The cabinet assembled in the finance ministry in Bern for a series of presentations from government officials, the Swiss National Bank, the market regulator Finma, and representatives of the banking sector.  The boards of the two banks are meeting this weekend. Credit Suisse’s key regulators in the US, the UK and Switzerland are considering the legal structure of a deal and several concessions that UBS has sought.  UBS wants to be allowed to phase in any demands it would face under global rules on capital for the world’s biggest banks. Additionally, UBS has requested some form of indemnity or government agreement to cover future legal costs, one of the people said.   Credit Suisse set aside SFr1.2bn in legal provisions in 2022 and warned that as yet unresolved lawsuits and regulatory probes could add another SFr1.2bn. UBS’s leadership team have concerns about taking on Credit Suisse’s investment bank, which has been the source of many of its scandals and losses in recent years, according to people familiar with their thinking. They would want to reassess the case for spinning off the bulk of the business into a new CS First Boston division. The race for a deal comes days after the Swiss central bank was forced to provide an emergency SFr50bn ($54bn) credit line to Credit Suisse.  This failed to arrest a slide in its share price, which has fallen to record lows after its largest investor ruled out providing any more capital and its chair admitted that an exodus of wealth management clients had continued.  Deposit outflows from Credit Suisse topped SFr10bn ($10.8bn) a day late last week as fears for its health mounted, according to two people familiar with the situation. Shares of other European banks were also hit hard by the crisis in confidence which was triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last weekend.  The prospective takeover reflects the sharp divergence in the two banks’ fortunes. Over the past three years, UBS shares have gained about 120 per cent while those of its smaller rival have plunged roughly 70 per cent.  The former has a market capitalisation of $56.6bn, while Credit Suisse closed trading on Friday with a value of $8bn. In 2022, UBS generated $7.6bn of profit, whereas Credit Suisse made a $7.9bn loss, effectively wiping out the entire previous decade’s earnings.  Swiss regulators told their US and UK counterparts on Friday evening that merging the two banks was “plan A” to arrest a collapse in investor confidence in Credit Suisse, one of the people said. There is no guarantee a deal will be reached. Negotiators have given Credit Suisse the code name Cedar and UBS is referred to as Ulmus, according to people briefed on the matter. The fact that the SNB and Finma favour a Swiss solution has deterred other potential bidders. US investment giant BlackRock had drawn up a rival approach, evaluated a number of options and talked to other potential investors, according to people briefed about the matter. A full merger between UBS and Credit Suisse would create one of the biggest global systemically important financial institutions in Europe. UBS has $1.1tn total assets on its balance sheet and Credit Suisse has $575bn. However, such a large deal may prove too unwieldy to execute.  The Financial Times has previously reported that other options under consideration include breaking up Credit Suisse and raising funds via a public offering of its ringfenced Swiss division, with the wealth and asset management units being sold to UBS or other bidders.  UBS has been on high alert for an emergency rescue call from the Swiss government after investors grew wary of Credit Suisse’s most recent restructuring. Last year, chief executive Ulrich Körner announced a plan to cut 9,000 jobs and spin off much of its investment bank into a new entity called First Boston, run by former board member Michael Klein.

"UBS to enter talks with Michael Klein to terminate First Boston deal","Executives at Swiss bank believe Wall St veteran secured terms from Credit Suisse that were too generous","UBS is set to enter talks with Michael Klein to unwind a deal that would have seen the Wall Street dealmaker take control of much of Credit Suisse’s investment bank, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The negotiations, coming days after UBS was forced to buy its Swiss rival for $3.25bn, underline the view among UBS executives that Klein secured terms that were too favourable. UBS also sees some value in keeping parts of the now defunct Credit Suisse’s investment banking unit. “We assume [Klein] is cherry picking. The deal was done when the selling bank had a gun held to its head and we are no longer in that position,” a person close to UBS said. “We are not here to enrich Michael Klein at the expense of our shareholders.”  Last October, Klein, a former Credit Suisse board member, negotiated a merger of his boutique advisory firm with the advisory and capital markets unit of Credit Suisse, planning to spin off and list the combination under the historic First Boston brand. Klein would have owned a minority stake and the Swiss lender a majority position. Credit Suisse had agreed to buy M Klein & Company for $175mn and separately paid Klein personally another $10mn for advising on the restructuring of its investment bank. UBS has now assigned a legal team to examine how to void the contract Credit Suisse signed with Klein in the cheapest way possible, the people said. In particular it is reviewing whether it can scrap or negotiate down a break-up fee owed to Klein. However, if it cannot, one person said, the costs to activate the break clause would not be material. One person close to Klein said they “seriously doubt” the transaction can go ahead on the same terms because “First Boston can’t be what it was meant to be” with its parent company set to disappear. This person said Klein had always acted in the best interest of Credit Suisse shareholders and contacted UBS immediately after the announcement of the merger to convey his understanding that the spin-off might not proceed.  A critical part of First Boston’s strategy was a close partnership with Credit Suisse’s wealth management and trading operations, which is unlikely to continue under UBS’s ownership, the people said.  Once Credit Suisse is subsumed, First Boston would no longer be able to receive capital from its parent or be able to distribute equity to staff that transferred over, they added. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for Klein. For Klein, the deal would have fulfilled an ambition of running a high-profile Wall Street business after his 2008 departure from Citigroup. A protégé of former Citigroup leader Sandy Weill, the 59-year-old investment banker was once considered a candidate to take the helm of the Wall Street giant.  After founding M Klein & Co, which employs 45 staff, Klein has continued acting as an adviser to chief executives, corporations and governments on big transactions. He has become a close adviser to Saudi Arabia, including on the initial public offering of its state oil company Saudi Aramco. Former Credit Suisse shareholder Harris Associates had raised questions over the terms of the deal with Klein and his possible conflict of interest given the banker had been on the board for four years. UBS has assessed that parts of Credit Suisse’s advisory and capital markets operations are complementary to its own, while it is planning to accelerate a rundown of its trading operations.  “Credit Suisse’s strength, particularly in the US and the technology sector, makes a very good fit to our strategy, where we know that technology entrepreneurs are the wealth creators of the future,” chief executive Ralph Hamers said on a call with analysts Sunday night. Hamers also wants to retain bankers specialising in pharmaceuticals, media and telecoms, which UBS believes will provide a pipeline of wealthy customers for its private bank.

"UBS agrees to buy Credit Suisse for more than $2bn","Swiss authorities engineer a deal that will combine the country’s two largest banks  ","UBS has agreed to buy Credit Suisse after increasing its offer to more than $2bn, with Swiss authorities poised to change the country’s laws to bypass a shareholder vote as they rush to announce a deal before Monday. The all-share deal between Switzerland’s two biggest banks is set to be announced as soon as Sunday evening and will be priced at a fraction of Credit Suisse’s closing price on Friday, all but wiping out the target’s shareholders, three people with direct knowledge of the situation said.  UBS will now pay more than SFr0.50 a share in its own stock, up from a bid of SFr0.25 earlier today worth around $1bn that was rejected by the Credit Suisse board, the people said. But the price remains far below Credit Suisse’s closing price of SFr1.86 on Friday.  The Swiss National Bank has agreed to offer a $100bn liquidity line to UBS as part of the deal, according to two people familiar with the matter.  UBS has also agreed to a softening of a material adverse change clause that would void the deal if its credit default spreads jump, they added. The material adverse change clause applies for the period between the signing and closing of the deal, the people said.  There has been limited contact between the two lenders and the terms have been heavily influenced by the Swiss National Bank and regulator Finma, the people said. The US Federal Reserve has given its assent to the deal, they added. However, some of the people criticised the plans to circumvent normal corporate governance rules by preventing a UBS shareholder vote. Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Ethos Foundation, which represents Swiss pension funds that own between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of Credit Suisse and UBS, told the Financial Times that the move to bypass a shareholder vote on the deal was poor corporate governance. “I can’t believe our members and UBS shareholders will be happy about this,” he said. “I have never seen such measures taken; it shows how bad the situation is.”   Both sides have been locked in discussions with regulators since Wednesday, when Credit Suisse asked the SNB to provide it with an emergency SFr50bn ($54bn) credit line. When this backstop failed to arrest a fall in its share price and stop panicked clients from withdrawing their money, the central bank stepped in to force a merger after becoming concerned about the viability of the country’s second-largest lender. Deposit outflows from Credit Suisse topped SFr10bn a day late last week, the FT has reported. Customers withdrew SFr111bn from the group in the final three months of last year. On Saturday night, the Swiss cabinet assembled in the finance ministry in Bern for a series of presentations from government officials, the SNB, Finma and representatives of the banking sector. The government is preparing emergency measures to fast-track the takeover and plans to introduce legislation that will bypass the normal six-week consultation period required for UBS shareholders so the deal can be sealed immediately, the people said. The framework of the deal has been designed by Swiss regulators to provide maximum stability to the country’s banking system, people briefed about the matter said. Swiss authorities have already secured preapproval from relevant regulators in the US and Europe, which are expected to issue co-ordinated statements today.  UBS will dramatically shrink Credit Suisse’s investment bank, so that the combined entity will make up no more than a third of the merged group, two of the people said. Negotiators have given Credit Suisse the code name Cedar and UBS is referred to as Ulmus, according to people briefed on the matter. As part of the deal, the FT earlier reported that UBS was seeking concessions and protections from the government, particularly from any pending legal cases and regulatory investigations into Credit Suisse that could result in fines or losses. However, it is unlikely it will get indemnity from any losses on assets, one of the people involved said. UBS also wants to be allowed to phase in any extra demands it would face under global rules on capital that govern the world’s biggest banks.  The deal with UBS comes just months after the Saudi National Bank and the Qatar Investment Authority injected close to SFr3bn into Credit Suisse as part of a SFr4bn capital raise. They are the bank’s two largest shareholders and jointly own 17 per cent of the stock. The SNB, UBS, Credit Suisse and Finma declined to comment.

"A very Swiss bank rescue ","UBS takeover of Credit Suisse eases market rout, but the deal will have repercussions","To paraphrase the former Bank of England governor Mervyn King, most banks are global in life but national in death. This is certainly true for Credit Suisse. After a weekend of intense negotiations, Swiss authorities brokered an emergency deal to sell the troubled 167-year-old institution to its more successful Swiss rival, UBS. A SFr50bn ($54bn) liquidity lifeline from the Swiss National Bank last week failed to stem the crisis of confidence facing Credit Suisse following Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse: its share price slumped and the flight of deposits accelerated. The deal has prevented a globally important bank from failing. But by putting Swiss interests at the heart of how the deal was structured, it has potentially troubling repercussions. Given the collapse of faith in Credit Suisse, it would have been unable to open for business on Monday morning. UBS was a ready buyer. The only alternative, a state-administered resolution, would have been messy and would have caused alarm to already febrile global markets. But as the only viable Swiss buyer, UBS was able to drive a hard bargain. Credit Suisse was sold for $3.2bn — a huge discount to its prior market value. The government guaranteed SFr9bn of the joint entity’s losses it may suffer on certain portfolios of assets. Swiss regulator Finma also demanded that $17.3bn of Credit Suisse’s additional tier one (AT1) bonds, debt that is designed to take losses during a crisis, be written off. It meant AT1 debtholders lost out more than shareholders.  The wipeout of AT1 bonds is the most controversial element of the deal. It cast doubt on the hierarchy of claims in the event of a bank failure: common equity is usually considered subordinate to these bonds in the capital structure, yet shareholders received a small sum at their expense. Finma cites a clause in the bond prospectus allowing this, but bondholders are now threatening a legal challenge. The surprise decision also sparked concerns that other AT1 investments posed similar risks: there was an initial sharp sell-off of other banks’ AT1 instruments. European authorities restored some calm by reassuring AT1 bondholders in eurozone and UK banks that they would not suffer the same fate.  The payout to shareholders is regrettable, though this may have been an attempt by the Swiss authorities to extend an olive branch to international equity holders, particularly from the Middle East, which is an important location for the banks’ wealth management operations. Legal challenges could add to uncertainty around the deal: shareholders are already miffed they did not get a vote on it and Swiss politicians have complained that the hefty government backstop, risking taxpayers’ money once UBS bears initial losses, was not debated in parliament.  The combined UBS-Credit Suisse will be a behemoth: its combined assets will be roughly twice the size of the Swiss economy. If Credit Suisse on its own was deemed too big too fail, the new entity will take on even greater global systemic importance — which makes its success crucial. In its domestic Swiss operations it will have a vast market share, which could distort competition and give it huge pricing power to the potential disadvantage of retail customers. Antitrust measures were waived on the grounds of preserving financial stability.  The reputational damage to Swiss banking will be significant. This is also a wake-up call that even banks with apparently healthy capital and liquidity ratios can tumble if confidence evaporates. Fear finds weakness, and Credit Suisse was long blighted by poor management. The Swiss authorities have helped to limit the market turmoil, to the relief of the financial world, but this expedient deal will still have repercussions. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage in the first place. Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","20.03.2023"
"Credit Suisse braced for backlash over UBS rescue at shareholder meeting","First in-person AGM for four years will be the bank’s last as an independent company following takeover","Credit Suisse is bracing for a tumultuous annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, when protesters are expected to vent their anger at the implosion of one of Switzerland’s historic financial institutions. The meeting will take place at a 15,000-capacity ice hockey stadium in the Zurich suburb of Oerlikon. It will be the bank’s first in-person AGM for four years and its last as an independent company after 167 years at the centre of the Swiss economy. The board is expected to bear the brunt of investors’ anger over the bank’s rescue two weeks ago by its rival UBS. Shareholders of both banks were denied a vote on the $3.25bn takeover thanks to emergency measures taken by the Swiss government to rush the deal through.  There is fear among Credit Suisse executives that the event could attract more vehement protests from Swiss citizens, who are outraged by the bank’s rapid decline and litany of recent scandals. More than three-quarters of Swiss voters want the combined mega bank to be split up by new legislation, according to opinion polls. Credit Suisse withdrew two votes from its AGM agenda last week, saying they were no longer necessary because of the takeover. The first was a vote on whether members of the board should be absolved of legal responsibility for the 2022 financial year. The second was on whether executives should receive a special SFr30.1mn bonus for completing the five-year restructuring that started last year. Proxy advisers ISS, Glass Lewis and Ethos Foundation had recommended shareholders vote against the so-called “discharge” vote, which is common in Swiss AGMs, as well as the bonus. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which is a top 10 independent shareholder in the bank, announced on Friday that in addition to voting against discharging the board and for the special bonus, it would also vote against the majority of directors. Norges Bank Investment Management said it would vote against chair Axel Lehmann, along with longstanding directors Iris Bohnet, Christian Gellerstad, Shan Li, Seraina Macia, Richard Meddings and Ana Pessora.  “Shareholders should have the right to seek changes to the board when it does not act in their best interest,” Norges said.  “We will . . . take into consideration unsatisfactory financial and strategic performance, mismanaged risk-taking, unacceptable treatment of stakeholders or undesired environmental or social outcomes from company operations.” Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders vote against Lehmann due to the lack of information the board provided over conflicts of interest regarding an agreement Credit Suisse had in place to transfer much of the investment bank to former director Michael Klein. The proxy adviser also raised conflict of interest concerns surrounding director Blythe Masters, who acted as an adviser to Apollo Global Management while Credit Suisse was negotiating with the US private equity group over the sale of its securitised products business. Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote against board member Mirko Bianchi for his role as chair of the audit committee after flaws were identified in the bank’s internal controls. Only registered shareholders and members of the media will be able to attend the meeting. Attendees will have to show identification and pass through security.  Lehmann and chief executive Ulrich Körner will address the audience and then invite questions from the floor, a process that is expected to take several hours as shareholders vent their frustration. UBS’s own AGM, which will take place on Wednesday at the 12,400-seater St Jakobshalle arena in Basel, is expected to be a less raucous affair. Proxy advisers have not recommended investors vote against meaningful parts of UBS’s meeting agenda and shareholders have so far been comfortable with the potential upside of the Credit Suisse takeover, despite being denied a say on it. UBS shares have risen more than 10 per cent since the deal was announced.","02.04.2023"
"Swiss government cuts bonuses for 1,000 senior Credit Suisse bankers","Executive team will lose outstanding variable pay entirely following lender’s rescue by UBS","The Swiss government has cut bonuses for about 1,000 senior bankers at Credit Suisse, with the executive team losing their outstanding variable pay entirely, after the lender’s rescue by its rival UBS last month. Following a meeting on Wednesday, the federal council, Switzerland’s executive body, called on the finance ministry to cut bonuses at Credit Suisse worth up to a total of SFr60mn ($66.1mn). The bank has also been ordered to consider whether bonuses that have been paid out can be recouped, and to report to the finance ministry and Finma, the financial regulator, on its efforts.  The ruling comes a day after the Credit Suisse board was confronted by angry investors at its first in-person annual general meeting in four years — and its final one as an independent company. Shareholders voted against a pay proposal for the executive team, which the board said it would take into consideration, though all members of the board were narrowly re-elected. Public anger over bankers’ bonuses has remained high in Switzerland since the 2008 financial crisis. The day after UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse in a $3.25bn takeover last month, protesters gathered in front of Credit Suisse’s headquarters over the proposed use of public money in the rescue deal. Bern has written a SFr9bn guarantee to UBS to support its digestion of its rival, and authorised a SFr100bn liquidity support facility from the Swiss National Bank. The government said that under article 10a of the Swiss banking act it had the power to impose pay-related measures if a systemically important bank was directly or indirectly granted state aid from federal funds. Under the terms of the ruling, members of the Credit Suisse executive board will have their bonuses cancelled, while staff one level below will suffer a 50 per cent cut. Staff a level below that will receive a 25 per cent reduction in their bonuses.  “This differentiated approach takes account of the most senior managers’ responsibility for the situation at Credit Suisse,” the federal council said in a statement. All bonuses accruing for all the three senior management levels before the takeover by UBS is completed in the coming months will also be cancelled. The government had temporarily suspended bonuses for Credit Suisse executives on March 21 but the federal council has now decided to put these measures in place. The total deferred bonus pool for all 49,000 Credit Suisse employees is SFr653mn, based on the share price of SFr0.76. When the bonuses were awarded they were worth SFr2.76bn. “In other words, all employees have already had to bear a total loss of more than SFr2bn due to the drop in Credit Suisse’s share price,” the federal council said. Credit Suisse shares had dropped more than 90 per cent over the past two years. The bank declined to comment.","05.04.2023"
"UBS chief Ralph Hamers’ pay jumps 11% but overall bonus pool falls","Increase in remuneration cements executive’s position as best-paid bank boss in Europe ","UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers enjoyed an 11 per cent pay bump last year, cementing his position as Europe’s best-paid bank boss. The Dutch executive, who joined from Dutch bank ING in 2020, earned a total of SFr12.2mn ($13mn) in salary and bonuses, up from SFr11mn the year before, UBS disclosed in its annual report on Monday.  UBS enjoyed a strong finish to 2022 as it benefited from clients defecting from rival Credit Suisse, which has been beset by multiple crises. UBS’s wealth management business has helped cushion the bank from the decline in dealmaking that has hit rivals, including Goldman Sachs.  UBS shares have surged 76 per cent since Hamers took over even though the bank’s full-year profits edged up just 2 per cent. “The board of directors recognised that Ralph Hamers successfully led UBS through a challenging year and delivered good financial results despite significant headwinds due to geopolitical and macroeconomic developments,” the bank wrote in its annual report. Hamers had complained about his level of pay at ING, which was subject to strict EU rules on banker pay. On joining UBS, he became one of the highest-earning bank bosses in Europe, comfortably beating peers in the EU, the UK and Switzerland. The increase in Hamers’ pay came as the Swiss lender’s overall bonus pool dropped 10 per cent to SFr3.3bn from the previous year.  For the group’s highest-paid employees, the bonus pool shrank 21 per cent, from SFr1.1bn in 2021 to SFr855mn last year. On average, the 699 so-called “key risk takers” received bonuses of SFr1.2mn. The decline reflected a drop in revenues at UBS’s investment bank last year. In their full-year results, US banks reported a 16 per cent fall in investment banking revenues, with fixed income fees down 30 per cent and equity fees dropping 8 per cent.  Revenues in UBS’s global markets division dropped 11 per cent while its global banking unit suffered a 52 per cent fall in income, mainly driven by lower capital markets revenues. Bankers across Wall Street have been braced for a drop off in bonuses following tough market conditions last year, with bonus pools cut by 30-40 per cent.  At Credit Suisse, executive board members went without a bonus last year, on the back of its second consecutive annual loss. UBS returned a total of $7.3bn to shareholders in 2022 and has said it will increase its dividend by 10 per cent. ","06.03.2023"
"Holders of $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds wiped out under UBS takeover","Value of risky additional tier 1 debt written down to zero in move that is expected to jolt markets","Holders of $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds will have their investment wiped out following the bank’s takeover by UBS, in a surprise move that is expected to cause ructions in European debt markets when they open on Monday. As part of the historic deal between the banks, Swiss financial regulator Finma ordered that SFr16bn ($17bn) of Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds, a relatively risky class of bank debt, will be written down to zero. Credit Suisse said it was informed of the decision by the regulator as it thrashed out the final details of its SFr3bn takeover by UBS, which was announced on Sunday evening after several days of intense negotiations.  “The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete writedown of the nominal value of all AT1 shares of Credit Suisse in the amount of around SFr16bn, and thus an increase in core capital,” Finma said. But several people involved in negotiating the deal said wiping out AT1 holders — a move that appeared to surprise markets — would have wider repercussions and was likely to lead to a sell-off of other bank debt.  Traders quoting prices on Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds on Sunday afternoon had marked them up significantly after the Financial Times reported that UBS’s takeover was confirmed, in expectation that the deal would not result in losses for bondholders. “What Finma has done breaking capital structure will have a long-term consequence for any Swiss financial debt,” said one Credit Suisse AT1 holder. One banker said the decision could lead to a “nightmare” in European debt markets, particularly given bondholders were having heavier losses forced on them than shareholders in Credit Suisse.  While AT1s are typically owned by professional bond investors and hedge funds, they are also popular among retail and wealth management investors in Asia.  “The market is likely to be shocked by such a blatant inversion of the hierarchy of creditors and by the decision to sweeten an equity deal at the expense of bondholders,” said Jérôme Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments. AT1s were introduced as part of the post-global financial crisis regulatory reforms that pushed banks to increase their capital levels. They are a form of contingent convertible security, or coco, which can be converted into equity if the bank runs into trouble. If a bank’s capital ratio falls below a predefined threshold, AT1 investors can lose their principal or have their investment converted to equity. As the riskiest form of bank debt in Europe, AT1s typically offer higher yields than safer bonds. The Credit Suisse deal echoes the takeover of stricken Spanish lender Banco Popular in 2017, where the bank’s AT1 bonds were wiped out in the first example of the value of the hybrid asset class collapsing in the rescue of a European bank. The takeover by Santander had been orchestrated by the European Central Bank’s oversight unit, the Single Resolution Board, after the ECB deemed the bank was “failing or likely to fail”.

"Sergio Ermotti, the career banker tasked with making Swiss rescue work","UBS calls back former chief executive to steer takeover of Credit Suisse","In bringing back Sergio Ermotti as chief executive, the UBS board has gone for someone who knows the bank well. Ermotti held the role from 2011 to 2020 and won plaudits for leading its recovery from the financial crisis.  Born in Switzerland, the 62-year-old is a career banker, having completed stints at Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UniCredit before moving to UBS.  As chief executive, his main task was to solidify the bank after a SFr6bn ($6.5bn) bailout by the Swiss government during the financial crisis and a $2.3bn rogue trading scandal. Ermotti scaled back the investment bank — although did not close it altogether despite some calls for him to do so — and built up the core wealth management operation.   “My best decision was not to follow consensus . . . I’m sure I wouldn’t be the CEO today if I had done it,” he told the Financial Times in an interview in 2020. “As a leader, your first instinct is usually the right one.” The share price was at about the same level when he left the job as it was when he started, but that compares favourably with a drop of almost 60 per cent in the value of Credit Suisse over the same period.  Ermotti stood down in 2020, saying: “After nearly a decade as CEO, now is the right time to write my next chapter. UBS is in great shape, enjoys maximum strategic flexibility and is well positioned for sustainable growth.” Ralph Hamers took over from Ermotti in 2020 and will stand aside now as the Swiss banker takes back the reins. Since stepping away from UBS, Ermotti has kept himself busy with board seats at fashion group Ermenegildo Zegna and at Innosuisse, the Swiss innovation agency.  He has also been chair of reinsurance group Swiss Re, although his time there has not been without controversy. Last year, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that investors vote against Ermotti’s re-election because of a lack of gender diversity on the board.   Despite these distractions, he is relishing his return to the top job at UBS.  “The task at hand is an urgent and challenging one,” Ermotti said in a statement on Wednesday, promising to deliver “the best possible outcome for our clients, our employees, our shareholders and the Swiss government”.

For all of you, and for us,” Lehmann told shareholders at the bank’s first in-person AGM in four years, held at a 15,000-capacity ice hockey stadium in a north Zurich suburb. “The bitterness, anger and shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments of the past few weeks is palpable.”   Credit Suisse executives had been braced for protests from Swiss citizens at the meeting after the bank was rescued by its rival UBS two weeks ago in a contentious takeover. “For that I am truly sorry. I apologise that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you,” Lehmann said. After Lehmann, who took over as chair a year ago, and chief executive Ulrich Körner’s introductory speeches, attendees were given the opportunity to ask questions and vent their frustration, a process that took several hours. The bank had been expecting up to 2,000 shareholders to attend the meeting.

Christian Gellerstad, who had been on the board for four years, received just 50.05 per cent support. Proxy advisers had urged shareholders to vote against several members of the board, including Lehmann. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, a top 10 independent shareholder, said it would vote against the majority of the board, including Lehmann. The board needed all seven members to be voted through in order to adhere to its own rules after five directors stood down before the AGM began.   Credit Suisse also received a slender majority for its pay policy for the board and executive team, though it narrowly lost a vote on approving the fixed pay policy for the executive board. At times the meeting turned fractious, with Lehmann asking shareholders to keep their time on the podium to a minimum, but these requests were ignored by some speakers and met with jeers from attendees. Shareholders asked the board for a range of additional information on the circumstances around its $3.25bn takeover by UBS.  More than three-quarters of Swiss voters want the combined mega bank to be split up by new legislation, according to opinion polls. “I understand that you feel disappointed, shocked or angry,” Körner told investors at the AGM. “I share the disappointment of you, our shareholders, but I also share the disappointment of all of our employees, our clients, and, ultimately, the general public.” Körner added: “After 167 years Credit Suisse is giving up its independence.  “A proud and, at times, turbulent company history is drawing to an end and something new is being created.” Shareholders of both UBS and Credit Suisse were denied a vote on the takeover thanks to emergency measures taken by the Swiss government to rush the deal through. The first shareholder to speak at the event commented on the strict security measures put in place, which Lehmann said was to ensure attendees were protected. “I didn’t bring my gun along today, don’t worry,” he told the Credit Suisse board. “I am wearing my red tie today to represent that I and many other shareholders are seeing red.” Shareholders also asked the bank to take a range of measures, from ending the financing of a liquefied natural gas project in Texas that has endangered a sacred indigenous burial ground to ceasing its legal action against finance blog Inside Paradeplatz. Other shareholders proposed hiring a special auditor to assess the events leading up to Credit Suisse’s takeover, while a lawyer from Lausanne put forward a 10-point ethics code for UBS to adopt. Lehmann said he would pass them on to Sergio Ermotti, the incoming chief executive at UBS. Among the more bizarre incidents of the meeting was a speaker who suggested the Credit Suisse board would have been crucified in medieval times, while another offered the board a bag of empty walnut shells, which he said cost the same as a single Credit Suisse share. Lehmann said he would accept the gift, though he added that he had his own packet of nuts to keep him going through the meeting.

"Colm Kelleher: Irish financial crisis veteran orchestrating Credit Suisse takeover","UBS chair pivotal to biggest banking deal since 2008","During the depths of the global financial crisis, Colm Kelleher was instrumental in keeping Morgan Stanley afloat — an experience the Irish finance veteran will draw on as he oversees the biggest bank takeover since those tumultuous days. “He was on the phone with regulators all the time,” recalled John Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive at the time. “He was the point person, working with the whole US Treasury group and guys in Washington to make sure that ourselves and the likes of Goldman Sachs survived and the whole bank run was blocked.”  As chief financial officer, Kelleher was responsible for taking decisions that were unpopular at the time to make sure there was enough liquidity within the bank to avoid the fate of rival Lehman Brothers, which collapsed in ignominy. A decade and a half later and Kelleher is once again centre stage in a banking crisis — this time as chair of UBS, the Swiss lender that agreed to rescue its fierce rival Credit Suisse two weeks ago. The 65-year-old, who prefers to operate in the shadows, has been thrust into the spotlight after orchestrating the first ever union of two global systemically important financial institutions. UBS’s $3.25bn rescue of Credit Suisse will create the world’s fourth-largest bank — with 120,000 staff and $5tn of assets under management — and by far the most important financial institution in Switzerland.  UBS chair Colm Kelleher, left, with new chief executive Sergio Ermotti and outgoing chief Ralph Hamers at a media conference in Zurich on Wednesday © Michael Buholzer/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock But the drama did not stop there. Just 10 days after agreeing the takeover, Kelleher replaced UBS’s chief executive, Ralph Hamers, with the Dutchman’s predecessor, 62-year-old Sergio Ermotti, who ran the bank between 2011 and 2020. It was a sign of Kelleher’s ruthless streak, but a decision he told journalists was down to needing to have in place “the better pilot [for] this next voyage of UBS”.  The moves have cemented Kelleher’s position as Europe’s most powerful banker — a far cry from growing up as one of nine siblings in Cork. After graduating from Oxford university and training as an accountant, Kelleher joined Morgan Stanley’s London office in 1989, initially working on the bank’s fixed income desk before becoming head of global capital markets. He was spotted by Mack, who tried to bring him across to Credit Suisse when he was appointed chief executive of the Swiss bank in 2001. But Kelleher resisted the overtures and instead moved to New York with Morgan Stanley.  After Mack returned to Morgan Stanley in 2005, he made Kelleher his CFO in 2007. In just a few months in 2008, Kelleher aggressively ran down the bank’s balance sheet and tripled its cash position. “During the financial crisis Colm was pivotal to Morgan Stanley’s survival,” said Huw van Steenis, vice chair of Oliver Wyman who worked at the bank with Kelleher for 15 years.  “His steeliness and financial savvy was the perfect complement to John’s hustle to save the firm.” After Mack left in 2010, Kelleher missed out on the top job to Australian James Gorman. But the pair worked closely over the following decade, cutting back the investment bank and refocusing the business on wealth management — a strategy he will lean on again while integrating the Credit Suisse business. While Kelleher’s gregarious nature, dry sense of humour and booming laugh made him popular among Morgan Stanley colleagues, his offhand comments occasionally caused offence. He fell out with Paul Taubman, his co-head of Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities group, in 2011. Taubman later left the bank to start his own advisory boutique, PJT Partners.  After retiring from Morgan Stanley in 2019, Kelleher took a year out to spend time with his wife and three children, learn to play the piano and walk 500 miles of the Camino de Santiago, a popular pilgrim route across northern Spain, when he raised more than $300,000 for a student sponsorship programme. The donor list — which offers an insight into Kelleher’s network — includes a host of high-profile bankers, such as Bob Diamond, António Horta-Osório, Bill Winters, Ross McEwan and Joe Perella, as well as investment management executives Manny Roman, Rick Rieder and Michael Hintze. When Kelleher took over from German former central banker Axel Weber as chair of UBS a year ago, he not only inherited his predecessor’s office but also his apartment, just a few blocks from the bank’s Zurich headquarters. Kelleher, fourth from left, made headlines in November when a joke he made on stage about pandering to China at a Hong Kong forum was reported as UBS turning its back on the west © Vernon Yuen/NurPhoto/Getty Images Since pitching up at UBS, Kelleher has kept his management team on their toes. One senior executive said this was down to his training as an accountant. “He actually does know his stuff — he doesn’t like anything fluffy, no BS,” the person said. “Don’t go into a meeting unprepared — he is a serious person, he has been through a crisis before.” Kelleher made global headlines in November when a joke he made on stage about pandering to China at a high-profile Hong Kong financial forum was reported as UBS turning its back on the west. “We’re not reading the American press, we actually buy the [China] story,” he said, following earlier remarks by the vice-chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission about international media giving inaccurate accounts of what was going on within the country. Kelleher will be keen to avoid similar mis-steps as he draws on his experience of the financial crisis to ensure the rescue of Credit Suisse is a success for UBS. “This is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008,” he said this week. “I would argue it’s bigger than any deal that was done in 2008.” Additional reporting by Stephen Morris","31.03.2023"
"UBS profits rise after Credit Suisse client defections","Bank benefits after billions pulled from wealth management accounts at Swiss rival","UBS enjoyed a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the final quarter as it benefited from clients switching from rival Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank on Tuesday reported $1.7bn of net profit in the final three months of 2022, comfortably ahead of analyst estimates of $1.3bn, bringing the group’s profit for the year to $7.6bn. The bank was one of the main recipients of clients pulling billions of dollars from their wealth management accounts at Credit Suisse late last year, following social media rumours about its financial health.  Net new fee-generating assets — a metric UBS uses for new money managed — rose by $23bn in the final quarter, bringing the total for the year to $60bn. “Clients turned to us for advice and stability,” said chief executive Ralph Hamers. But the Dutchman told analysts that Credit Suisse clients in Asia who were switching their assets were not the primary reason for UBS’s inflows. “Although we are certainly the natural place for these clients to go to, they are generally already a client of ours,” he said, adding that investors with a higher risk appetite were tending to move their money to other banks. UBS also benefited from rising interest rates, with net interest income in its wealth management business increasing 35 per cent, although revenues at its investment bank dropped 24 per cent. Analysts tipped UBS’s investment bank to be one of the strongest performers in Europe, even though it faced the same challenging market conditions as Wall Street lenders last year.  In their full-year results this month, US banks reported a 16 per cent fall in investment banking revenues, with fixed income fees down 30 per cent and equity fees dropping 8 per cent. Revenues in UBS’s global markets division dropped 11 per cent while its global banking unit suffered a 52 per cent fall in income, mainly driven by lower capital markets revenues. UBS repurchased $5.6bn of shares in 2022 and said it planned to distribute a further $5bn to shareholders in buybacks in 2023, ahead of the $4.7bn forecast by analysts. The bank returned a total of $7.3bn to shareholders in 2022 and said it would increase its dividend by 10 per cent to $0.55 per share. UBS shares have risen 25 per cent over the past three months as banks have benefited broadly from rising interest rates, but they dropped 3.5 per cent to SFr19.16 on Tuesday morning. Hamers told journalists he believed the fall was “a bit of a correction” after the bank’s shares had risen in the first few weeks of the year.  “UBS share price had a strong run since December and although results are slightly ahead of consensus, price performance could be negatively impacted in the short-term,” said Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, who blamed weak revenues from equity trading, wealth management and transaction banking. While UBS shares trade at a 22 per cent premium to its book value — making it the most valuable large bank in Europe — it still trails US competitors on the same measure, such as Morgan Stanley at a 75 per cent premium and JPMorgan at 55 per cent. UBS chair Colm Kelleher, who joined last year, has prioritised attracting large US active fund managers to boost the group’s share price and narrow its valuation gap with Wall Street peers.

"FirstFT: Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund held detailed talks to buy Lazard","Also in today’s newsletter, China cuts interest rates for the first time in a year and UBS faces penalties over Archegos ","Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ held detailed talks to take Wall Street investment bank Lazard private, in a move that underlined the oil-rich emirate’s ambitions to acquire a western financial services company. The talks were held this year between Lazard, led by outgoing chief executive Ken Jacobs, and ADQ, led by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the fund’s chair and Abu Dhabi’s powerful national security adviser, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. Negotiations fell apart after both sides walked away from a deal. Lazard, which is best known for its advisory business in Paris, New York and London, had been focused on maintaining operating independence, one person added.  Lazard said: “As you’d expect, we talk to people all the time but we don’t comment on speculation.” ADQ declined to comment. Since the talks ended, Lazard has embarked on a succession process with Jacobs, who has led the firm since 2009, set to become its executive chair.

"And Europe’s best-capitalised bank is . . . .","*drumroll*","... Well, would you look at that:  Capital ratios offer one nonsense way to approach Credit Suisse’s first-quarter results. Earnings offer another: basic EPS of Sfr3.1 ($3.49) meant it was CS’s most profitable quarter since 2007. A cursory check of the data suggests it’s the biggest quarterly profit per share booked by a systemically important European bank since the GFC. Before you all rush to the comment box, let’s emphasise the obvious. Headline numbers are wildly distorted by the zeroing in March of CS’s AT1 buffer securities to raise Sfr15bn. The emergency cash infusion is recorded as corporate centre net revenue, resulting in a record pre-tax profit of Sfr12.8bn.   Putting numbers on the bank run is more instructive. First-quarter outflows totaled Sfr61.2bn, or 5 per cent of assets. Wealth management alone bled out by nearly 10 per cent, or Sfr47.1bn, as withdrawals peaked in the days around the UBS shotgun marriage. The shrinking capital stack reduced net interest income by 39 per cent sequentially to just Sfr900mn. Net borrowings from the SNB liquidity support facilities at the quarter end amounted to Sfr108bn. There’s also a zeroing of goodwill for wealth management, which creates a Sfr1.3bn charge, and a warning about the uncosted nature of dismantling an investment bank.  After making all the appropriate adjustments, CS’s underlying quarterly loss is slightly more than Sfr1.3bn, which another cursory checks suggest is probably the heaviest booked by a systemically important European bank since the GFC. While CoCo holders will argue that they were not treated equitably by Swiss regulator Finma, the results underline that in all plausible outcomes their paper was going to be worthless.  But is CS enough of a basket case to weigh down UBS? Who knows.  Gutting the investment bank is an obvious first step to stabilisation, as our Lex colleagues argue. Here it’s worth noting that prep has already begun with creation of a Capital Relief division. UBS only has to wear the first Sfr5bn of markdowns, writedowns and restructuring costs, after which Sfr9bn of state guarantees come into play, so the task of making CS boring again has a bit of runway.  Speaking positively for boring-ification are stable Q1 revenues and relatively modest outflows from the Swiss bank, which may hint that franchise value isn’t irreparably damaged domestically. The option to partially IPO the Swiss bank is a useful safety net for UBS if its integration plan stalls or overruns.  More alarming for incoming management is CS’s asset management division, where fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 10 per cent. Any further worsening would require another goodwill impairment, which would be much more damaging to confidence in the rescue mission than the IB writedown.  UBS posts first-quarter numbers on Tuesday. New CEO Sergio Ermotti has already flagged that investment bank trading flows have been weak in the US and worse both for APAC and EMEA, so divisional earnings will probably be down year-on-year by more than a third. Stability or better for wealth management is much more important. JPMorgan talks about how a combined CS-UBS will be in a sweetspot among Asia-Pacific’s ultra-high-net-worths, with $500bn in regional assets under management and scope for inflows of approximately $150bn every year.  Getting there will cost $27bn in restructuring, fair value adjustments and legal expenses so the day-zero buffer of almost $20bn should be sufficient, says the broker, which saw nothing in today’s CS numbers to change its opinion:  Post acquisition, we see the Newco UBS becoming one of the most attractive business models in Global Banking with 60 per cent of Group PBT coming from Wealth Management and only 10 per cent from IB. In addition, we forecast the combined entity to be a cashflow powerhouse generating almost 160bps in CET1 capital pre-distribution in 2027E through a capital-light model of asset gathering accounting for almost 70 per per cent of Group PBT.[ . . . ]We forecast UBS to be a $3+ EPS bank by 2027E . . . with full downside protection from the optionality of a Swiss Bank IPO/spin-off at minimum $10bn valuation, should the complex integration not deliver. Though of course, Credit Suisse is already a $3+ EPS bank. Be careful what you wish for. Further reading:— The rise and fall of the bank that built modern Switzerland (FT)— Who killed Credit Suisse?

"Credit Suisse bankers and clients courted by Swiss rivals","Staff retention is ‘number one’ priority at UBS after takeover as wealth managers aim to capitalise on turmoil","Switzerland’s private banks are seeking to poach key staff and clients from Credit Suisse as steep job and bonus cuts force bankers into the market following the takeover by UBS. Julius Baer, Pictet, Lombard Odier, EFG and LGT are among Swiss wealth managers sounding out disgruntled Credit Suisse bankers, people familiar with ongoing conversations have told the Financial Times, offering job stability and attractive sign-on packages to make up for bonuses blocked or wiped out by the government-backed UBS takeover. Credit Suisse employees saw hundreds of millions of francs worth of deferred bonuses erased by the emergency takeover this month, while the Swiss government has ordered a freeze on future bonus payments. Many are also anticipating swingeing job cuts, as UBS seeks to integrate its biggest rival into its own successful franchise.  “The best people don’t wait,” said one senior executive at a top-five Swiss bank which is negotiating with individuals at Credit Suisse. “This is a highly competitive environment. All UBS has to offer is five years of insecurity.” A board member at another rival said he knew of an entire Credit Suisse team, of 10 to 15 people, that was looking for an exit. “They will move in a block. [It’s] in a location where UBS already has a team. The head of location knows he’s not going to be number one, so he has decided he wants to look for other options and his team will follow him . . . Things are going very fast.” Credit Suisse’s operations in Asia are a particular area of focus, several rival bankers said. The region has been the major driver of profit growth in Swiss private banking over the past decade, but the spoils have been unequally shared. Many midsize Swiss banks have, until now, been outcompeted by the two big banks.  The share price at Julius Baer, which has a sizeable Asian footprint, rose 13 per cent last week. While most analysts have been positive about what the takeover of Credit Suisse will mean for UBS, the loss of key employees will have a significant impact on what the banks’ combined wealth management franchise eventually looks like, some have warned.  “In the end this is a relationship business,” said Andreas Venditti, analyst at Vontobel, a large Swiss private bank. He said he expected senior bankers to take major clients with them when they depart. In some respects, he said, they would be pushing at an open door.  “You have a lot of ultra high net worth individuals [UHNWI] who were clients of both UBS and Credit Suisse, because they value diversification,” he said. “UBS has tried to play down the overlap of clients but I would be very surprised, frankly, if it was that low.” He also pointed to an existing trend of outflows: rich clients took SFr95.7bn ($104bn) out of Credit Suisse accounts, net, last year.  The head of one Geneva-based private bank said they had seen “significant” inflows from their rival and expected more. “Of course, if you were a UHNWI who had assets shared between CS and UBS, you’re now looking to share your assets elsewhere with the two becoming one.”  He, too, said he was negotiating with Credit Suisse staff: “We are spending a lot of time on the phone.”  “Clients are worried — everyone is worried — about where this is going,” said Nicole Curti, chief executive of Capital Y, an adviser to ultra-wealthy individuals and families, and president of the Alliance of Swiss Wealth Managers.  “The advice we have been giving to clients is to diversify — to the private banks like Pictet, Lombard Odier and of course Julius Baer, but also to the Swiss cantonal banks, which have good online payment systems for custody of cash,” she said.  Curti said she also expected a lot of Credit Suisse bankers to join smaller wealth-advisory boutiques, or set up their own, as well as flock to established private banks.  An adviser to UBS said retention was now the “number one” issue for management as it grapples with digesting its rival.  The combined bank will have a balance sheet of close to SFr5tn, with SFr3.3tn of assets managed for the very rich. “Credit Suisse private bankers are being called left, right and centre,” he said. “The real worry at UBS is about retention over the next six weeks before the deal’s done . . . Some of the domestic Swiss banks are going to Credit Suisse private bankers and offering an increase in compensation but also committing to pay bonuses that at least include their deferred compensation, so they will be making them whole on what they are losing at CS.” Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","29.03.2023"
"Swiss regulators voiced concerns in 2019 about ability to save Credit Suisse and UBS ","Authorities said no possibility of the orderly wind-down of one of the two big lenders","Swiss authorities concluded in 2019 that the country’s two biggest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, could no longer be saved in the event of a liquidity crisis using emergency measures put in place after the 2008 financial crash.  “The special liquidity requirements for SIBs [systemically important banks] embedded in the Liquidity Ordinance [do] not safeguard the higher resilience of SIBs required by the Banking Act,” a government working group, comprising members of the Ministry of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the market regulator Finma decided nearly four years ago.  There was also no possibility of the orderly wind-down of one of the two big banks, the group added without far greater government support than had been previously anticipated.   A summary of the group’s work was disclosed in Finma’s annual report, released on Tuesday, and highlights the extent to which Credit Suisse’s near-collapse raises serious questions for regulators around the world.  Switzerland was regarded as having applied a particularly stringent version of international regulatory standards on handling banking crises put in place after the financial crash 15 years ago.  The information will also add fuel to an escalating political crisis in Bern, with parliamentarians poised to convene for a special emergency session next month to scrutinise the government-organised rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS just over a week ago.  Public anger over the deal is mounting, with a majority of Swiss in favour of legislation to split up the new bank and claw back bankers’ bonuses.  On Monday night, both the upper and lower houses of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland announced they would be triggering legislation for the creation of a special parliamentary commission of inquiry, with wide-ranging powers of subpoena, to investigate the sudden merger of the two banks, which will combine to become the fourth-largest lender in the world.  Several prominent lawmakers have asked why Swiss authorities did not take earlier measures to safeguard Credit Suisse — an issue that is likely to be a key focus of the commission.   Just days before the bank’s rescue, Finma and the SNB publicly reassured investors that the bank was stable and had plentiful liquidity at its disposal. Following the government working group’s 2019 conclusions on inadequate liquidity provisions, it took three years for the Federal Council — the Swiss executive — to amend its existing ordinances on emergency liquidity. The new measures, which were intended to address the working group’s concerns, came into effect last June.  They were still inadequate, however, as became rapidly clear in the months that followed.  Finma began to harbour serious concerns about Credit Suisse’s liquidity, even with the expanded liquidity laws in place, last October.  In an interview with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper on Saturday, Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter said clarification over the liquidity problems at the bank had been the first issue she had raised with civil servants when she took office in late December.  She recalled asking: “When will the point be reached at which the authorities have to intervene? At which point will Finma come to the conclusion that CS is no longer viable?”","28.03.2023"
"Pickleball pandemonium","Won’t someone think of the retirees?!?","For too long Wall Street has remained silent about a threat stalking America’s seniors.  Now a team of brave UBS analysts is finally calling out this scourge of the sporting world, in a note titled: “Is Pickleball Driving Higher Health Care Utilisation”?  OK fine, in reality pickleball falls somewhere between an absurd public nuisance and a much-needed inclusive outdoor exercise.   Still, the UBS analysts’ note is based on one noteworthy fact: Americans who use Medicare (aged 65 and up) are apparently getting more outpatient surgeries, particularly for their hips and knees. UnitedHealth’s CFO discussed the trend at a Goldman Sachs conference this month. With our emphasis:  . . . outpatient levels have continued to be an area that we’ve really focused on most. . . leading indicators in two weeks of June [are showing] continued strong outpatient care activity.Think things [like] hips, knees, and senior business. Hips, knees, cardio, very localised in Medicare businesses [are] where we’re particularly seeing the trend. There are some indications that looks a little bit like a pent-up demand or delayed demand being satisfied . . . We have insight into other areas, for example, our ambulatory surgery practices that we own and operate, [we’re] seeing very strong volumes . . . So that has continued to be quite strong actually in terms of the care — at the levels of care activity that seniors are getting. There are some obvious reasons for the recent increase in outpatient surgeries. Older Americans can now get surgery for non-life-threatening conditions that they put on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, as the UNH executive mentions above.  But blaming pickleball is a much funnier theory. From UBS, with our emphasis:  After analysing the growth in pickleball as well as the nature and frequency of related injuries, we conducted a bottom-up analysis of medical costs. All in, we estimate $250- 500 m of medical costs directly attributable to pickleball and see potential for greater medical costs indirectly linked to pickleball. Of this, we estimate that 80% of the cost is treated in outpatient settings (i.e. ED, Doctor Visits, OP surgeries) and 85% accrues to Medicare, which coincides with higher trend categories called out by UNH and HUM.  To be sure, $250m to $500m doesn’t look like much compared to the $800ish billion spent on Medicare parts A and B (tax-funded inpatient and outpatient care), the analysts point out.  Still, they deem it “plausible” that pickleball is contributing a noticeable amount to medical costs:  . . . we estimate that pickleball contributes 3-6 bps of annual Medicare medical costs. By care setting, we see about 6 bps of medical costs in the outpatient setting and 2 bps of medical costs in the inpatient setting. While this may seem trivial, it’s plausible that pickleball medical costs are driving 5-10 per cent of the unexpected medical cost trend this year. Also, it’s maybe a stretch to estimate current-day pickleball injuries based on an academic study covering data from 2010-2019, the way the analysts do.   The game’s explosion in popularity has apparently happened in just the past few years, and trend stories portray pickleball as a sport that’s long been popular with retirees and just now catching on with the youth. A younger demographic probably experiences fewer injuries, and definitely won’t have access to Medicare when they do get injured. That said, here’s more than you ever needed to know about seniors’ pickleball injuries, from UBS and the aforementioned study published in Injury Epidemiology in 2021:   The analysts also use historical Google Trends data to measure the increased popularity of pickleball. While the trend is clear, we don’t want to opine on whether or not this is an accurate reflection of interest from retirees. (Mostly on behalf of the 75-and-under crowd, many of whom seem more tech savvy than the seniors of yore.)   Still, it must have been tough for the analysts to speak out in this manner against the costs to society of Big Pickle.  Private equity has bought a stake, after all, and Hong-Kong listed Prada Group got a cut of the action; at one point it was selling a $2,500 pickleball accessory, as Lex highlighted.  So stay strong, UBS analysts. We’re rooting for you. ","26.06.2023"
"UBS to raid boutique banks for M&A dealmakers","Swiss lender’s hiring plans in stark contrast to rivals cutting thousands of jobs","UBS is planning to pick off disgruntled dealmakers from investment banking boutiques, as the Swiss lender looks to bolster its capabilities in mergers and acquisitions while competitors lay off staff. The bank has not hired as aggressively as Wall Street rivals in recent years, but it is preparing to lure strong candidates with attractive packages, according to people with knowledge of the plans. The moves come as big investment banks cut thousands of jobs, reversing several years of strong recruitment and following a tough 12 months for dealmaking.  This week, Morgan Stanley confirmed it had laid off 1,800 staff — more than 2 per cent of its global workforce. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, started a process of firing more than 3,000 staff last week — though many of those roles were in its lossmaking consumer banking division. Investment banking fees fell almost 50 per cent at both banks last year after a dearth of mergers and new stock market listings.  UBS’s recruitment also stands in stark contrast to its Zurich rival, Credit Suisse, which is in the process of removing 9,000 roles from its 52,000-strong global workforce. The Financial Times reported last week that Credit Suisse had begun consultations over cutting 10 per cent of European investment bankers this year. A person with knowledge of UBS’s plans for its investment bank said the lender would target strong performers from boutique advisory businesses, arguing that talent was stronger at smaller firms than at larger rivals.  The bank would try to lure especially experienced managing directors who believed there was little room for promotion at their current employers and who felt “stuck in a rut”.  UBS would offer generous packages — in line with the market rates at the boutiques — for bankers who delivered results, they added. Boutique M&A advisory groups — specialist outfits such as PJT Partners, Houlihan Lokey,  Evercore, Lazard, Greenhill and Robey Warshaw — have been steadily winning market share from traditional bulge bracket investment banks since the financial crisis. They have been able to poach staff from traditional investment banks with the promise of larger financial packages.  UBS has pulled back from investment banking over the past decade, instead devoting more resources to its wealth management business. But senior executives at the bank believe its disciplined approach to expansion in recent years has given it a strong platform to expand while competitors cut back. This week UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers said the bank was “bucking the trend” when it came to hiring asset and wealth managers.   In a television interview with Bloomberg at Davos, Hamers said the bank was “not in retrenchment mode”, adding: “We are hiring for what we call critical jobs. In Asia-Pacific, in the Middle East, we are hiring absolutely because we have the momentum.” UBS declined to comment on its plans for hiring in investment banking. ","20.01.2023"
"Swiss regulator defends $17bn wipeout of AT1 bonds in Credit Suisse deal","Writedown after takeover by UBS enraged holders of risky bonds","Swiss financial regulator Finma has defended its decision to wipe out a huge swath of risky subordinated bonds as part of the Credit Suisse rescue deal.  The move taken on Sunday, which rendered SFr16bn ($17bn) of investments worthless, has become one of the most controversial elements of the shotgun marriage between Credit Suisse and its larger rival, UBS, brokered by Swiss authorities.  Just hours after the deal was announced, other large market regulators began to distance themselves from the decision, fearful that it would endanger banks’ ability to raise capital in the future.   Enraged bondholders have pledged to sue the Swiss government and Finma over the matter.  In its first statement on the deal since the weekend, Finma said on Thursday that all the contractual and legal obligations had been met for it to act unilaterally given the urgency of the situation.  “On Sunday, a solution was found to protect clients, the financial centre and the markets,” said Finma’s chief executive Urban Angehrn. “In this context, it is important that Credit Suisse’s banking business continues to function smoothly and without interruption.” Speaking to the press on Thursday, Swiss National Bank chair Thomas Jordan argued that the purchase by UBS had been the only option for Credit Suisse, saying that a takeover of the bank by the government and stabilisation of it in a process known as resolution would have risked a systemic crisis. “Resolution in theory is possible under normal circumstances, but we were in an extremely fragile environment with enormous nervousness in financial markets in general,” said Jordan. “Resolution in those circumstances would have triggered a bigger financial crisis, not just in Switzerland but globally. “[It] would not have worked to stabilise the situation but, on the contrary, created enormous uncertainty . . . It was clear that we should avoid it if there was any other possibility.”  At the crux of the controversy was the regulator’s decision — taken in conjunction with the SNB and Swiss ministry of finance — to preserve some value for Credit Suisse shareholders, who would nominally be subordinated to any bondholders in the capital structure.  UBS will pay SFr3.25bn for Credit Suisse’s shares.  The additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds in question contained explicit contractual language that they would be “completely written down in a ‘viability event’ in particular if extraordinary government support is granted”, Finma said. This allowed the regulator to prioritise equity holders ahead of AT1 holders. AT1s are a type of hybrid debt instrument created after the financial crash of 2008 to give banks greater capital flexibility in the event of crises. As part of the acquisition deal by UBS, the combined bank will receive SFr9bn of government guarantees and a SFr100bn liquidity lifeline from the SNB.  An additional emergency government ordinance issued by Bern on Sunday had further confirmed the power to take decisions over elements of a bank’s capital structure in Swiss law, Finma said.  “[The] instruments in Switzerland are designed in such a way that they are written down or converted into [equity] before the equity capital of the bank concerned is completely used up or written down,” it said, pointing out that the bonds were designed for the use of sophisticated institutional investors because of their risky hybrid nature.  Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing bondholders that have pledged to fight the Swiss decision.  Quinn hosted a call on Wednesday joined by more than 750 participants.  Partner Richard East told the Financial Times the deal was “a resolution dressed up as a merger” and pointed to statements by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which distanced themselves from the Swiss approach.  “You know something has gone wrong when other regulators come and politely point out that in a resolution [they] would have respected ordinary priorities,” he said.

"Credit Suisse staff prepare to sue regulator Finma over lost AT1 bonuses","Bankers contact lawyers over bond-linked rewards that were wiped out by UBS rescue","Credit Suisse staff are preparing to sue the Swiss financial regulator over $400mn of bonuses that were cancelled following the bank’s rescue by UBS. Thousands of senior Credit Suisse bankers have a portion of their bonuses linked to the group’s additional tier 1 bonds, securities that were wiped out in the takeover orchestrated by Swiss authorities in March. Law firms Quinn Emanuel and Pallas, which are already suing the Swiss regulator Finma on behalf of investors who owned the AT1 bonds, have received multiple requests from senior managers at Credit Suisse to take legal action on their behalf too, according to several people familiar with the matter.  At this point, lawyers are unclear whether claims from Credit Suisse employees could be bolted on to the existing suits filed against Finma or would need to be lodged separately, the people added. “We have been contacted by Credit Suisse managers from around the world to see how we could help them,” said one person involved in the discussions. “There is a lot of overlap between the two positions, but they are not exactly the same.” The bonuses date back to 2014 when managing director and director-level staff at the bank were offered a contingent capital award as part of their remuneration. The unconventional awards were designed to mimic AT1s, which could be converted into equity or written down to zero if the bank was in distress.  CCAs typically made up about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of a manager’s total bonus and vest after three years. They also provided two interest payments a year. In 2021, the last year they were granted, more than 5,000 Credit Suisse staff received them. AT1s are a type of hybrid debt instrument created after the financial crash of 2008 to give banks greater capital flexibility in the event of crises.  Credit Suisse had initially asked Finma if the CCAs could be treated differently to AT1s, but employees were told three weeks ago that their awards would be wiped out along with the AT1s. UBS said this week that it would book a $400mn gain from the move once it completed the takeover.  On Monday, Credit Suisse staff were informed that they would receive the final interest payment on the CCAs before they were erased. Bonuses have been hit in other ways, including equity awards as Credit Suisse’s share price has plunged 93 per since the beginning of 2021. Last month, the Swiss government ordered that bonuses for about 1,000 senior Credit Suisse bankers should be cut. Under the ruling, executive board members had their bonuses cancelled, while staff one level below suffered a 50 per cent cut. Staff a level below that received a 25 per cent reduction. The treatment of AT1s has proved to be one of the most divisive aspects of UBS’s $3.25bn purchase of its rival. Quinn Emanuel and Pallas represent investors in separate suits holding more than a third of the $17bn of AT1 bonds that were rendered worthless. In an early victory for claimants last week in what is expected to be a long-running case, Finma was forced to divulge the decree that wiped out their investments. The judge overseeing the case, which was filed in the city of St Gallen in eastern Switzerland, ordered the regulator to hand over the decree, giving the AT1 bondholders a firmer foothold to contest the writedown. Credit Suisse, Finma, Quinn Emanuel and Pallas all declined to comment.","22.05.2023"
"Swiss regulators need to face up to Credit Suisse failures","As the country prepares for the challenge of supervising an enlarged UBS, rule changes are not the answer","The writer is a managing director at Frontline Analysts and the author of ‘Lying for Money’ In their reaction to what global regulators are euphemistically referring to as “the recent market turmoil”, there could hardly be more contrast between the approach taken by the Swiss National Bank and the US Federal Reserve.   The Fed’s report on the failure of Silicon Valley Bank was lacerating in its self-criticism of supervisors who “failed to take forceful enough action”, but did not include inadequacies in the actual rule book in its top four “takeaways”.    The Swiss authorities, on the other hand, seem to have given a largely defensive response on the part of the supervisors at Finma, while the SNB has called for quite a comprehensive set of changes to bank regulation. The changes the SNB suggests are all individually sensible, but seem out of proportion to the problem they are meant to address. One proposal to exclude deferred tax assets from what counts as regulatory capital in benchmark ratios of financial strength makes sense. These assets tend to lose their value in exactly the conditions in which capital is needed. But the writedown of deferred tax carried out by Credit Suisse in the third quarter last year had an effect of only 0.48 percentage points on its common equity tier one ratio; this can’t make the difference between success and failure.  Similarly, it makes sense for a bank such as Credit Suisse to be required to keep much greater balances of assets that could be pledged at the central bank, to cover short-term liquidity needs.  But even under the existing rules, Credit Suisse managed to survive a bank run that lasted from the end of last October to the start of March. If four months was not enough time to turn things around, what real benefit is there in providing resources to extend it to five or six? The real problem — and the one that is most psychologically intolerable for bankers and regulators alike — is that when the shit really hits the fan, there is nothing at all that can save a bank. So a supervisory relationship needs to be based on an understanding of the actual risks in the business model plus common sense and co-operation on the part of management. If either of these are absent, it is not reasonable to expect a really well-calibrated capital ratio to make the difference.  This appears to be the growing consensus of global regulators, with the European Central Bank in particular taking the lead in rejecting “wholesale review of the regulatory framework or the components of regulatory frameworks”.   When the last review of the global banking regulations (the so-called Basel IV standards) was finalised, there was an implicit promise that the industry could expect a period of prolonged regulatory stability, with no more than technical tweaks.  Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank were both quite unusual institutions, and bank supervisors are given considerable discretion to tailor the rules on a case-by-case basis. Rather than allowing the regulatory standards to grow ever longer, in the forlorn hope that they might cover every possible business model in the world, it makes sense to ask the supervisors to take their powers and use them. What we should be worried about, therefore, is not the changes the SNB is proposing, but the rule book that it wants to change. The Swiss “Too Big To Fail” regulatory system was designed after the 2008 crisis to deal with those banks that were large compared with the country’s economy.   Once the merger between UBS and Credit Suisse is complete, this will effectively be a one-bank regime. Although Zürcher Kantonalbank, PostFinance and the Raiffeisen Group are formally considered too big to fail, they are considered to pose little threat to the economy and have much less complicated structures and business models. A system like this is known to be hard to manage. It is difficult at the best of times for a bank supervisor to stand up to a large and well-resourced institution; it becomes much more difficult to do so when that bank is a single national champion.    There is always a difficult question of balancing the need to build up technical expertise with the need to rotate personnel to avoid “regulatory capture”. This is much harder to achieve when there is only one team in the building working on a complex global firm. We only have to look at the problems BaFin in Germany had in supervising first Deutsche Bank and then Wirecard.   The Swiss system is going to be faced with a challenge that many others have failed at. Regulators will need to face up to it, rather than going into a comfort zone of tweaking the standards.","27.06.2023"
"Swiss under fire for shotgun marriage of Credit Suisse and UBS","Bondholders and international regulators criticise state decision to prioritise shareholders amid threat of legal action","The Swiss government has come under fire from bondholders and international regulators for its handling of the $3.2bn rescue-takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.  The two banks were forced together over the weekend by Swiss officials in a shotgun marriage that stabilised the teetering Credit Suisse but wiped out $17bn of its bonds, upending the normal priority of investors. The decision to favour shareholders at the expense of bondholders sent a shockwave through already brittle markets on Monday morning, with investors in so-called additional tier 1 bonds fearing that they too could be sacrificed in a similar scenario at another bank.   AT1s issued by other European banks fell about 10 points on Monday morning, according to Tradeweb data, with UBS bonds trading at 83 cents on the dollar, Deutsche Bank’s at 63 cents and BNP Paribas’ at 70 cents. Davide Serra, founder of Algebris Investments, said the move was a “policy mistake” by the Swiss authorities, who had “basically stolen” the bonds while facilitating a SFr3bn ($3.2bn) payment to shareholders. Jérôme Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, which holds Credit Suisse AT1s, said the move could undermine trust in financial markets. “It’s more than a pure legal issue — it’s about market confidence and how you treat investors fairly.” US law firm Quinn Emanuel said on Monday it was in discussions with several bondholders “representing a significant percentage of the total notional value of AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse” over possible legal action. It added that an investor call to explore “potential avenues of redress” was likely to take place on Wednesday. AT1s are often called “contingent convertible” bonds and have their roots in the 2008 financial crisis. They are designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble. As global banks’ debt sold off on Monday, other countries’ regulators intervened to say they would not follow the Swiss model in resolving distressed banks.  The European Central Bank said “common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses” while the Bank of England said AT1 bonds ranked ahead of equity and would face losses “in the order of their positions in this hierarchy”. The backlash came despite the fact that Credit Suisse’s bond documentation made it clear that Swiss regulators were not “required to follow any order of priority”.  In volatile trading, shares in struggling Californian bank First Republic tumbled more than 33 per cent. UBS recovered from a 14 per cent slump shortly after markets opened to close 1.3 per cent higher, though on Monday evening S&P cut the bank’s credit rating outlook to negative, citing “material execution risk in integrating CS”. Among the beneficiaries of the deal are Credit Suisse staff who hold stock and have also been told they can receive a bonus in the coming weeks. “We will continue to allocate for a 2023 performance bonus for those eligible,” wrote Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann and chief executive Ulrich Körner in an internal email. However, the acquisition price is a steep 59 per cent discount to the bank’s closing share price before the deal and some bankers have also been paid in the now worthless AT1 bonds.  Many are braced for job cuts, which are expected to number in the thousands. Managers said they would “work diligently and at pace” to inform staff and “aim to continue to provide severance in line with market practice”.  Swiss investors have said they will consider legal action over the government’s use of emergency measures that meant shareholders did not get a vote on the transaction. Ethos Foundation, which speaks on behalf of pension funds and other institutional investors that own up to 5 per cent of both banks, said the takeover was “a huge waste for the shareholders and the Swiss economy”. Swiss politicians are being balloted on an emergency sitting of the country’s parliament to scrutinise and potentially block elements of the takeover by UBS.

"Credit Suisse CDS: déjà vu all over again ","If at first you don’t succeed . . . ","You wait nearly two months for a question to be filed with the CDS determinations committee regarding Credit Suisse and then two come along at once. Earlier in the week, FT Alphaville delved into what we dubbed Schrödinger’s swap, an audacious plan to trigger credit-default swaps on Credit Suisse, which most in the market had assumed would not pay out.  While we would love it if you read the nearly 2,500 word dissection of the trade, the TL;DR version is this: two hedge funds thought the ambiguity over the ranking of a dead Credit Suisse bond was enough to turn the AT1 wipeout into a CDS payout.  Unfortunately the all-powerful CDS determinations committee did not agree. On Wednesday, the panel of market participants peered inside the box marked “Credit Suisse Group AG subordinated credit-default swap contract” and unanimously decided that the cat inside was very much alive:  There’s much more to say on the implications of the decision (stay tuned), but shortly after we to put pen to paper on this, another CS CDS question hit: Has a Bankruptcy Credit Event occurred with respect to Credit Suisse Group AG?The DC question has been raised in respect of Standard European Corporate, Standard European Financial Corporate and Standard European CoCo Financial Corporate Transaction Types. In respect of the Financial Transaction Types, the DC question relates to both the Senior and Subordinated Level.In particular, the Eligible Market Participant who submitted the question has requested that the EMEA DC consider whether a Bankruptcy Credit Event has occurred with respect to Credit Suisse Group AG under Section 4.2(b) or 4.2(h) of the 2014 Definitions.  The eagle-eyed FTAV readers will have no doubt noticed several key differences to the first question. Firstly, this one concerns both the senior and subordinated CDS contracts, rather than only the latter. Secondly, this is concerns whether a “bankruptcy credit event” has occurred, rather than a “governmental intervention credit event”. This may seem plainly silly to those unversed in the ways of CDS: Credit Suisse did not file for bankruptcy. But the key nuance here is related to the Section 4.2(b) referenced in the question (the other section referenced is a bit of a catch-all clause and is a little less relevant).   Section 4.2(b) means that the CDS can trigger if Credit Suisse “becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing in a judicial, regulatory or administrative proceeding or filing its inability generally to pay its debt as they become due” (our emphasis added). In the world of CDS, loose lips can sink ships. Which will be why the submitters have appended documents such as a speech from Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann and an interview with Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter.  Will it work? Our gut is that, again, it feels like a bit of a long-shot. But also that the communications around the shotgun-marriage-cum-rescue-operation that merged UBS and Credit Suisse have been so messy that you never know. At any rate, the DC has very quickly accepted the question:  So the wise men of the CDS at the very least think it is a topic worthy of debate. Stay tuned.","18.05.2023"
"Credit Suisse ordered to pay $926mn to former prime minister of Georgia","Ruling from Singaporean judge comes shortly before UBS is expected to complete takeover of Swiss rival","Credit Suisse has been ordered by a Singaporean judge to pay $926mn to former Georgian prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a final blow to the bank before UBS is expected to complete its takeover as soon as next week.  Ivanishvili, who is Georgia’s richest man, had already won a case against the Swiss bank in Bermuda last year, where he was awarded $607.5mn. The billionaire’s dispute with Credit Suisse dates back to 2011 when he was a client and victim of a private banker who defrauded some of the Swiss lender’s most sensitive accounts.  For more than a decade, Credit Suisse private banker Patrice Lescaudron defrauded some of the bank’s clients — including accounts held by Ivanishvili and Russian oligarch Vitaly Malkin — funding a lavish lifestyle of luxury houses, sports cars and Rolex watches. A damning report into the affair by the Swiss regulator Finma, which was inadvertently made public two years ago, found repeated warning signs, evidence of hundreds of suspicious transactions and four formal disciplinary proceedings had not been acted upon by Credit Suisse. The bank has long maintained that Lescaudron — who was criminally convicted in 2018 and died by suicide in 2020 after an early release — was a highly successful rogue operator who worked tirelessly to hide his illegal activity from superiors and colleagues. The Swiss criminal case against Lescaudron found the bank to have been a wronged party. A judge at the Singapore International Commercial Court on Friday ordered Credit Suisse’s local subsidiary to pay $926mn, less $79mn that it had already paid. The judge said that the sum in the Bermuda case should be recalculated so that there was no double recovery. In a statement, Credit Suisse said it would “vigorously pursue an appeal”, adding that the “judgment published today is wrong and poses very significant legal issues”. The bank is also appealing the Bermuda judgment. After taking into account money that has already been returned to Ivanishvili and the award in the Bermuda case, Credit Suisse expects to have to pay $500mn following the Singapore judgment if its appeal fails, according to people familiar with the matter.  A provision the bank had set aside to cover the Singaporean case is below that amount, they added. Credit Suisse was represented in the case by Charlie Falconer, the former UK Lord Chancellor who was a close confidant of former prime minister Tony Blair. Cavinder Bull SC of Drew & Napier acted as lead counsel for Ivanishvili. A spokesperson for Ivanishvili said: “We expect Credit Suisse to fully comply with the judgment and finally accept responsibility for its failures.’ The longstanding dispute with Ivanishvili is one of several legal battles that has hung over Credit Suisse in recent years. UBS has set aside $4bn to cover Credit Suisse’s regulatory and litigation matters. UBS’s takeover of its Swiss rival could be completed as early as next week after it received approval from EU antitrust regulators for the deal on Thursday. Speaking to Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger on Friday, Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who played a pivotal role in pulling together the shotgun marriage between the country’s two largest banks, appeared to call Credit Suisse directors and executives “arsonists”.   When asked whether politicians bore some responsibility for Credit Suisse’s downfall, she said: “You have to be careful not to confuse firefighters and arsonists. The board of directors and executive board are responsible for Credit Suisse — and not the government.” ","26.05.2023"
"The Lex Newsletter: UBS overlap will hit Credit Suisse staff hard in Asia","New owner of struggling Swiss bank is expected to cut jobs more heavily in the region than elsewhere","This article is an on-site version of The Lex Newsletter. Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader,  It feels like business as usual at Credit Suisse’s popular annual investment conference in Hong Kong, delegates report. This is deeply surreal, they say, considering that the struggling Swiss bank has just been forcibly combined with eternal rival UBS by politicians and regulators. The conference blurb speaks of “embracing reality” in a “lively setting designed to facilitate conversations and unlock opportunities”.   For many Credit Suisse bankers, this could involve asking other delegates for a job. The axe wielded by UBS, which shrank its own investment bank years ago, is expected to fall more heavily on Credit Suisse in Asia than elsewhere. Notably, Ulrich Körner is not attending the event at the Conrad hotel. The chief executive of Credit Suisse may already be privately seeking new employment. UBS chair Colm Kelleher and chief executive Ralph Hamers will keep those roles at the top of the enlarged business. UBS plans to cut the combined company’s annual cost base by more than $8bn by 2027. This would mean trimming Credit Suisse’s staffing costs by more than half. UBS and Credit Suisse employed almost 125,000 people at the end of last year. Of those, about 23,000 are in Asia. Here, Credit Suisse operations overlap heavily with UBS. Unfortunately for Credit Suisse bankers, UBS does better in most areas.  Credit Suisse has historic strengths. Its wealth management business in Europe was one of these, although clients have recently pulled large sums in deposits.  UBS is a bigger wealth manager in Asia. Credit Suisse planned to launch a full-service wealth management business in mainland China, doubling the number of relationship managers this year. With horrible irony, Credit Suisse received regulatory approval for the move just days before its collapse.   It also won approvals for proprietary trading and an expansion of its brokerage licence to cover all of China. It had previously been confined to the southern city of Shenzhen. Credit Suisse once had high hopes for investment banking in China. It has made only a modest impression. The group reportedly cut about a third of its China-based investment banking team and almost half of its research department in November last year.  In the equity capital markets business in Asia-Pacific, Credit Suisse ranked 20th in the league table in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data. It has about 1 per cent of the market. UBS has remained in the top five in the past year.  UBS has been building up its client base in China for a long time. It was the first foreign bank to take majority ownership of its investment banking unit in China. The lender already has $400bn in assets in Asia. Client overlap will be a big issue as UBS integrates Credit Suisse. Some customers holding accounts with both banks will limit their financial exposure to the combined lender by moving some of their funds to other wealth managers. This may be a little trickier than it appears. Chinese watchdogs have just tightened regulation of the wealth management and private funds industry in an attempt to reduce market risks. Outflows from local clients have accelerated in recent months following bond volatility.  The broader financial industry in Hong Kong appears relatively resilient, despite recent US bank collapses. But risks to financial stability are continuing to grow as China’s economy slows down. China’s largest bad debt manager, Huarong, has warned of a $4bn net loss for 2022. That points to rising defaults, especially among local property developers. Broad financial conditions and the opportunities they create are the explicit subjects of investment conferences. But we all know that networking is the main aim of many attendees. That makes Credit Suisse’s conference a hotter ticket than a star turn from prolific motivational speaker Bear Grylls would otherwise warrant.  Credit Suisse bankers, channelling their own survival skills, should make the most of the opportunity.

"Credit Suisse withdraws attempt to protect staff bonuses","More than $400mn in deferred pay was wiped out after a state-orchestrated rescue by UBS","Credit Suisse has given up trying to save its staff bonuses that were wiped out following the bank’s rescue by its rival UBS. Just over $400mn of deferred pay for Credit Suisse middle managers was reduced to zero as a result of the state-orchestrated takeover and several bankers are preparing lawsuits against Finma, the Swiss regulator, over their losses, the Financial Times reported this week. Credit Suisse had appealed to Switzerland’s Federal Administrative Court to protect the bonuses, which were linked to additional tier 1 bonds that were also wiped out. But the St Gallen court revealed on Tuesday that the bank had withdrawn its appeal.  “The withdrawal has the effect of rendering irrelevant the initiated proceedings, and the FAC accordingly struck them off the list of cases,” the court said, adding that a further appeal could be made to Switzerland’s Federal Supreme Court. The bonuses date back to 2014 when managing director and director-level staff at the bank were offered a contingent capital award as part of their remuneration. The unconventional awards were designed to mimic AT1s, which could be converted into equity or written down to zero if the bank was in distress. CCAs typically made up about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of a manager’s total bonus and vest after three years. They also provided two interest payments a year. In 2021, the last year they were granted, more than 5,000 Credit Suisse staff received them. Credit Suisse declined to comment on its withdrawn appeal. As part of its attempts to protect staff bonuses, Credit Suisse told Finma that it did not agree with its decision to write down the AT1s. The court also said that it had received 230 appeals involving 2,500 appellants against Finma’s decision to cancel the AT1 instruments.  Law firms around the world, notably Quinn Emanuel in Zurich and Pallas in London, have signed up bondholders representing more than a third of the $17bn that was invested in the AT1s when they were cancelled. AT1s are a type of hybrid debt instrument created after the financial crash of 2008 to give banks greater capital flexibility in the event of crises. UBS chair Colm Kelleher was asked on Wednesday morning about Finma’s decision to cancel the AT1s when other regulators said they would not have done so. “With respect, read the prospectus,” Kelleher said at a Wall Street Journal event. “It was very clear in the Swiss prospectus that viability was a wipe out issue — very clear.” Separately, the Swiss government on Tuesday confirmed plans to cut the full bonuses for around 1,000 of the most senior bankers at Credit Suisse for 2022 and 2023. Under the proposals put forward by Switzerland’s Federal Council last month, Credit Suisse’s executive board members would have their bonuses cancelled, while staff one level below would suffer a 50 per cent cut. Staff a level below that would receive a 25 per cent reduction.  “In addition, Credit Suisse must examine the possibilities for recovering remuneration already paid out to members of group management since 2019, and to report to the [Federal Department of Finance] and Finma on the matter,” the ministry said in a statement.","24.05.2023"

Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader, Last Friday, we speculated that Credit Suisse had been struggling to transact in the interbank market and might need to combine with UBS. This happened sooner than we expected. Swiss authorities arranged the shotgun wedding of Credit Suisse to its larger rival on Sunday. A distant yodel of distress from failed or struggling US regional lenders such as Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic exacerbated deposit flight at Credit Suisse. This has brought down an avalanche on European banking. The consequences have included:  the obliteration of a 167-year-old Swiss lenderturmoil in bank bondsserious damage to the standing of Switzerland as a financial centrea potentially irresolvable dilemma for central bank rate-setters UBS had its arm twisted to take over Credit Suisse before markets opened on Monday. Lex saw this as a decent deal for UBS nevertheless. It was underwritten with hefty state liquidity and a modest $3bn all-share purchase price.  To comment on this or any aspect of our coverage, please email me at Lexfeedback@ft.com. And thanks to the many hundreds of readers that participated in our survey. It will help set our course for the next few years. On Sunday, we predicted a storm of litigation, given the peremptory character of the UBS/Credit Suisse deal. By Monday, it was clear this would primarily be against Switzerland rather than UBS.  Swiss authorities had wiped out $17bn of Credit Suisse AT1s, bank bonds usually designed to evaporate after equity in a crisis. The unexpected move deepened losses on European AT1s as an entire asset class. We wrote that persistently high yields would make AT1s unviable for new issuance. Law firms such as Quinn Emanuel and Pallas are vying to represent AT1 owners. We gave the following précis of the nascent legal attack on Switzerland: Swiss law requires equity to absorb losses before debt in an insolvency and may do so in rescues toospecial cases where fine print permits hierarchy inversion may not include the UBS takeoverSwitzerland’s emergency ordinance wiping out the bonds may be overridden by overarching property rights The courtroom battle would simultaneously smack of hedge funds taking on defaulter Argentina in the noughties and the fictional case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce, which left only lawyers wealthier. We expect that central bankers will reflexively demand much higher capital buffers from commercial lenders. This would not stop bank runs during financial panics. But central bankers are a bit like those celebrities who say you can never be too rich or too skinny. They believe you should have more buffer capital in all circumstances.  They are more conflicted about interest rates. Inflation is still steep, but unless they moderate the path of rate rises, further panic and more bank collapses may result. As we predicted, the European Central Bank has softened its rhetoric. The Fed raised rates by a quarter point rather than half a percentage point on Wednesday. Slower, lower increases are a reason aside from higher capital buffers why bank profits will falter. UBS boss Ralph Hamers is left to integrate UBS with its erstwhile deadly rival. One ex-UBS investment banker of our acquaintance expects Hamers to dispense with more than half of Credit Suisse’s workforce. Almost nobody will go from UBS he believes. Lex predicts that the axe will fall most heavily on Credit Suisse’s Asian units. We think UBS has a decent chance of bolstering its position in global wealth management. ’Fraid in America The UK government that dealt with the 2007-2008 great financial crisis tended to bracket it with phrases such as “the American financial crisis that was invented by Americans and came over here from the US”. Clear on that? The GFC had nothing to do with the wild UK lending practices that UK politicians had done nothing to stop. Lex expects European politicians and central bankers to blame the US for the current instability in the same way. Undeniably, the proximate trigger for current turmoil was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in California. The US leg of the crisis went on twitching this week. Fugitive deposits have been swelling money market funds. We see these as relatively safe investments (fingers crossed).   Regional bank shares plainly are not safe. We had some sympathy with a call from the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America for an extension of deposit insurance above a cap of $250,000 each. Sheila Bair, former boss of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, pointed out that deposit flight could simply increase the competitive advantage of Wall Street giants. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen responded with mixed messages during the week.  The Federal Reserve has lent as much as $109bn to First Republic, at present the most precarious US regional bank. It is doing so at an annualised cost of 4.75 per cent. The bank’s asset book, largely of long-dated mortgages, recently yielded 3.5 per cent. This is a bad look and a recapitalisation will be needed. New York Community Bank agreed to absorb failed crypto-focused lender Signature. The acquirer received a gift of £2.7bn in equity and its shares leapt accordingly. Non-apocalyptic news Chatbots continue to obsess tech types. Google launched its Bard chatbot in rivalry with OpenAI’s upgraded ChatGPT, which was unveiled last week. The potential for seamless human/computer interaction is exciting, but the technology is not there yet. Nor is the business model. Sports cars work pretty well, though Italians apparently joke that the only time you see a Maserati on the street is when it is being towed to the garage. The company is midway through a strategic U-turn: it has realised profits matter more than sales. That revelation should help if it eventually floats. We valued Maserati at about €6bn after surveying its peer group.   John Lewis is another famous brand that could be open to external investment. The employee-owned business comprises department stores and the Waitrose groceries chain. A turnround plan does not appear to be bearing fruit and the business may sell a £2bn minority stake to an external investor. Spedan Lewis, the architect of employee ownership, must be spinning in his grave. Stuff I enjoyed this week I am still reading Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.  I also relished the FT’s account of the decline and fall of the Credit Suisse empire by Stephen Morris, James Fontanella-Khan and Arash Massoudi. This was compellingly written. I would not say I entirely enjoyed reflections on the same collapse by Tidjane Thiam, who ran the bank until 2020.

"Retail investors flock to join Credit Suisse bondholder lawsuit","Swiss regulator had ordered wipeout of bank’s subordinated bonds as condition of UBS rescue","Retail investors from the US, UK, Middle East and Asia have joined the landmark $4.5bn institutional bondholder lawsuit against the Swiss government over its role in the forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS last month. Quinn Emanuel, the law firm that filed a case against the Swiss regulator Finma last week, has partnered with five other specialist law firms around the world to sign on “thousands” of smaller retail investors to the litigation who were also burned by the takeover. Finma shocked debt markets when it ordered that SFr16bn ($17.9bn) of subordinated Credit Suisse bonds be completely wiped out as a condition of UBS’s rescue of its rival in mid-March, even while preserving some value for shareholders in the bank.  The bonds, known as additional tier one (AT1) or contingent capital bonds, were designed to be sold to sophisticated institutional investors. Swiss authorities have insisted that the instruments were wiped out in a manner exactly as anticipated in their design. The instruments, which became popular among banks after the 2008-09 financial crisis, contain contractual provisions that allow for a regulator to write down their value if an issuer’s balance sheet is under stress and certain triggers are hit. The Swiss government initially stressed that the debt instruments had only been sold to big professional investors who knew what they were doing. But in recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that small retail investors were also big holders of the AT1 bonds. “The unlawful action of Finma has had devastating consequences on thousands of retail and small investors globally,” said Dennis Hranitzky, head of Quinn Emanuel’s sovereign litigation practice. “While the headlines to date have focused on larger institutional holders, it is important to recognise the impact this has had on the savings of many individual investors who have been unlawfully deprived of their property rights and deserve justice,” Hranitzky added. Quinn Emanuel said it was working with Wollmuth Maher & Deutsch in the US, Keidan Harrison in the UK, Engelin Teh in Singapore, Global Advocacy and Legal Counsel across the Gulf states and Geissbühler Weber & Partners in Switzerland to represent small investors.  Finma said it declined to comment on the lawsuit. A spokesperson said the regulator had already made public a detailed justification for its actions.  A second deadline for investors to join Quinn Emanuel’s lawsuit in Switzerland — one of the single largest-ever bondholder actions against a sovereign authority — is fast approaching. Quinn Emanuel has told investors that it has until next Wednesday to file a second suit on behalf of additional plaintiffs, based on a 30-working-day limit on appeals in Switzerland against regulatory decisions. Many in the Swiss legal community regard any appeal against Finma as a long shot. But Quinn Emanuel says it has a chance to overturn the regulator’s ruling on constitutional grounds of the need for proportionality and due process. Any successful case will depend heavily on a process of discovery in the coming months, however. The Swiss government has tightly protected disclosures around the frantic 72 hours of decision-making that preceded Credit Suisse’s takeover.  At the least, Quinn Emanuel hopes to use the court in St Gallen where it has filed its complaint to force the government to reveal the nature of its decision-making, which might provide fertile material for further legal action.  A potential parliamentary commission, with wide-ranging powers of subpoena and the ability to override Swiss government rules on official secrets, may also provide ammunition for the litigants.  Swiss parliamentarians will vote on whether to establish the commission when they meet next month.","28.04.2023"
"Santander moves to hire some of Credit Suisse’s top dealmakers","Spanish bank seeks to poach senior investment bankers after Swiss lender’s rescue by UBS","Santander is in talks to hire several of Credit Suisse’s most senior investment bankers in New York, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Spanish bank seeks to capitalise on the Swiss lender’s emergency rescue by UBS. Santander has held discussions with bankers including David Hermer, Credit Suisse’s global head of equity and debt capital markets, who has been with the bank since 1994, and Malcolm Price, global head of financial sponsors coverage, the people said.  The goal for Santander is to hire several senior Credit Suisse dealmakers and then more junior employees on their teams could follow, the people added. They cautioned that the talks between the bankers and Santander could still break down.  Credit Suisse and Santander declined to comment. Hermer and Price declined to comment through a Credit Suisse spokesperson.  Santander, while primarily a retail and commercial lender in Europe and South America, has ambitions to become a significant player in investment banking in the EU and the US. It is a strategic priority for chief executive Héctor Grisi, who himself joined Santander in 2015 from Credit Suisse and was promoted to the top role by chair Ana Botín last June. Grisi has set divisional head José María Linares an annual growth target of about 15 per cent from 2022 to 2025 for Santander’s corporate and investment banking division in North America. While an ambitious goal, the Spanish bank remains dwarfed in scale by Wall Street rivals and is best known in the US for its subprime car financing business. Even though revenue has grown at an average rate of 13 per cent since 2017, the investment bank still only contributes a modest amount to the global group. In 2022, the unit generated 14 per cent of Santander’s €52bn of total income, compared with 81 per cent for retail banking. The rationale for hiring bankers such as Hermer and Price, two well-known Wall Street veterans, is to enhance Santander’s ability to compete against other large banks to work on significant initial public offerings and leveraged buyouts. Linares told the Financial Times in 2021 that he wanted to get into more lucrative areas such as M&A advisory, particularly working with private equity groups, to complement its leading positions in project finance and investment grade debt.  Credit Suisse was the seventh-highest fee-earning investment bank worldwide last year while Santander did not make the top 10, according to Refinitiv data. The Spanish bank made only $800mn in dollar-based capital markets and advisory fees last year. The talks also underscore the rush by rivals to try to poach top talent from Credit Suisse in the wake of its rescue by UBS, which was orchestrated by the Swiss government. How to integrate Credit Suisse’s investment bank into UBS’s more risk-averse culture is viewed as one of the bigger challenges for the merger.  UBS has said it intends to swiftly wind down or sell parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank and the Swiss government has committed funds to protect it against some of the losses it will incur.  Credit Suisse confirmed on Monday that it had terminated a deal with former board member Michael Klein to spin out the dealmaking unit under the First Boston brand. This leaves many of the staff that would have transferred over with an uncertain future as part of the merged group. Credit Suisse had already been losing several senior dealmakers in recent years as numerous scandals, including more than $5bn in losses from the collapse of family office Archegos Capital and its dealings with specialist finance group Greensill Capital, damaged its franchise and pummeled its stock price.

Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning All eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve later today as it makes a pivotal decision on whether to press ahead with interest rate rises amid the worst banking turmoil since the 2008 financial crisis. The collapse of two regional banks since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee has highlighted the risks of the central bank’s aggressive policy to contain inflation to the US financial system while the forced takeover of Credit Suisse by rival UBS underlines the threats to the global banking system. At the start of the month, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell had floated the idea of accelerating the pace of rate rises back to a half-point after a slowdown.   Now markets are expecting a quarter-point move or a pause in rises from the current Fed fund rate of 4.50 per cent to 4.75 per cent. The rate decision will be accompanied by a revised set of projections about the path forward for monetary policy through to 2025, as well as forecasts for growth, unemployment and inflation. Powell will also host a press conference following the conclusion of the two-day meeting.

"Active European funds deliver worst returns in more than 20 years","UBS analysis for 2022 shows vehicles in aggregate delivered -4.13% of alpha after fees","Latest news on ETFsVisit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools Actively managed equity funds in Europe had their worst year of underperformance for more than two decades in 2022, according to analysts at UBS. In a research note on European asset managers, the analysts wrote that active equity funds domiciled in Europe generated, in aggregate, -4.13 per cent of alpha last year after management fees, the poorest annual result since their analysis began in 2000. Alpha can be defined as any outperformance, or in this case underperformance, of the market.  The research analysts added that, amid the volatile environment that characterised 2022, they “would have expected active equity managers to have benefited from attractive alpha opportunities”.  The analysts draw a comparison to 2020, the last “volatile equity year”, when alpha generation among active equity managers reached a 20-year high. This article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group. In 2022, active equity funds in Europe had their worst spell of performance in the first half of the year, when 96 per cent of the equity fund underperformance was logged, according to the report. Two-thirds of the underperformance came in the first quarter alone. “We think this was driven by the strong rotation away from growth assets as a higher interest rate environment had a disproportionately large impact on their terminal values,” UBS analysts Michael Werner and Amit Jagadeesh wrote. They also believe the underperformance can be partly explained by “benchmark selection”, as several funds displayed “a mismatch between their underlying strategy and their primary benchmark index choice”. The analysts pointed to Morningstar’s UK Equity Mid/Small Cap category, which was the group of funds/product variety to record the lowest level of alpha generation on average in 2022. The FTSE 250 index “significantly underperformed” the FTSE 100, which benefited from exposure to large-cap banks and commodity-related names, so funds in this category that selected the FTSE All Share as its index suffered from sharp underperformance — minus 11.2 per cent on average — while the funds that opted for a small and mid-cap index recorded average underperformance of 4.4. per cent.  Meanwhile, among fixed income funds, excess returns were negative but “not out of the ordinary”, UBS found. Latest news on ETFsVisit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings Active fixed income funds underperformed by -0.46 per cent in 2022, which was their worst year for alpha generation since 2018 but “in line” with the average between 2000 and 2022, excluding 2008, the analysts wrote. The negative alpha for fixed income funds was concentrated in the second quarter of the year, which was mitigated by positive alpha generated in the fourth quarter. *Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

"Credit Suisse: investment bank is bad bedfellow for wealth unit","Clients pulled SFr61.2bn ($68.6bn) of assets from Credit Suisse in the first quarter","Boa constrictors are adapted to swallow large prey. Banks are not. The discomfort of UBS — bounced into acquiring Credit Suisse by Swiss officialdom — will be worsened by deposit flight from its struggling counterpart. Clients pulled SFr61.2bn ($68.6bn) of assets from Credit Suisse in the first quarter, compared with SFr110.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2022. This supplies a new insight and highlights an old truism. The insight is that wealth management assets are not innately sticky, despite claims to the contrary. Over two reporting quarters, customers who lost faith in Credit Suisse withdrew assets equivalent to over a fifth of the total held by the wealth management division.  The truism is that bosses’ reassurances are worth little in a crisis. In December, Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehman said customer outflows had “completely flattened out” and “basically stopped”. That claim now appears delusional. Swiss financial regulators must, however have been more worried about the Bank’s eroding cash deposit base. This fell by a dismaying SFr205bn to SFr166bn over the two quarters, pointing to the possibility of bankruptcy.  That has evidently been averted by Swiss state intervention, leaving stabilisation of Credit Suisse’s wealth management division as the main task for UBS boss Sergio Ermotti. A big slice of its assets and revenues must be gone for good. Nearly 300 Credit Suisse relationship managers, 14 per cent year on year, have already left. Adjusted for one-offs, wealth management in the past eight quarters made up 30 per cent of total revenues, according to Jefferies data. UBS must integrate its rival skilfully to make the most of a low purchase price of $3.25bn. Restructuring and litigation will be costly. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns cheaply for $1.2bn during the financial crisis of 2008. Boss Jamie Dimon moaned as recently as 2015 that 70 per cent of some $19bn in lawsuits against JPMorgan related to its smaller rival.  The uncertainty overshadowing wealth management gives Ermotti an added incentive to make heavy cuts to Credit Suisse’s dicey investment bank. At Credit Suisse, revenues from the division nearly equalled those of wealth management.   There is no comparison otherwise. In normal conditions, earnings from wealth management are predictable, earnings from investment banking are not. Credit Suisse’s problem went beyond this: the antics of its investment bank destroyed the trust of many wealth clients, and that of depositors to boot. Credit Suisse investment bankers considering external job offers should not expect Ermotti to fight too hard to keep them.

"MPs question UK financial watchdog over its handling of Crispin Odey probe ","Scrutiny of FCA’s investigation follows assault allegations against the hedge fund manager","MPs have demanded that the City watchdog explain its investigative work into sexual misconduct allegations against the hedge fund manager Crispin Odey and his firm. Harriett Baldwin MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, wrote to the Financial Conduct Authority on Wednesday asking the regulator to detail the “nature and intensity of their supervision and engagement” with Odey Asset Management over the past five years. The letter comes after the Financial Times revealed 13 women alleged they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Crispin Odey over a period spanning more than two decades. He strenuously denies the allegations.  The revelations have prompted the FCA to broaden an existing investigation into the firm, and have led major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, and most recently UBS, to cut ties with the hedge fund.  Baldwin described the alleged sexual misconduct detailed against Crispin Odey in the FT as “highly inappropriate”. She said: “Culture in financial services, and the experiences of women in the industry, are ongoing concerns of the Treasury Committee.”  She added: “Journalists at the Financial Times have shone a light on deeply troubling allegations of conduct regarding the actions of a powerful individual.” FCA bosses are due to appear before the select committee by the end of July as part of the MPs’ normal work on holding the regulator accountable for its decisions and performance.  “We understand the committee’s interest in this and we’ll of course reply shortly,” an FCA spokesperson said.  Odey Asset Management declined to comment on the issues raised in the select committee’s letter.   In early 2021, Odey Asset Management gave the FCA an internal report that concluded the financier had at times behaved inappropriately with female staff, the FT investigation revealed.  The report indicated Crispin Odey had been given a formal written warning by its firm’s executive committee and told to no longer communicate with female staff about non-work matters, nor invite female staff to lunch or engage in unwanted touching. The FCA subsequently opened an investigation into potential “non-financial misconduct” at Odey Asset Management, according to people familiar with the probe.  The inquiry later shifted to examine corporate governance issues after Crispin Odey fired his executive committee in late 2021 when it attempted to discipline him a second time for breaching the terms of his final written warning. The committee on Wednesday asked the FCA to clarify what action it took after it received the report from Odey Asset Management in early 2021 that detailed inappropriate behaviour by the firm’s founder. It also asked if the FCA had previously received reports about Odey’s conduct and what action the regulator subsequently took.  According to the FT investigation, Crispin Odey threatened to take the UK financial watchdog to court if it did not drop its 2021 investigation into sexual misconduct that examined almost two decades of allegations against him at his eponymous hedge fund firm.  The threat failed to stop the FCA’s investigation, but the letter to the regulator asks whether the regulator takes into account the litigiousness of the subject of an investigation when determining its approach and whether it required more resources in the face of that threat.  The MPs also questioned how unusual it was for an executive committee to be dismissed.  The select committee’s correspondence comes as UBS became the latest financial institution to end its relationship with Odey Asset Management.  UBS has begun the process of severing ties with the hedge fund manager, according to people familiar with the moves. The Swiss bank had offered prime broking services to the firm’s funds, but it had been an “inactive relationship for a number of years”, one of the people added.  Prime brokers offer a range of services to their hedge fund clients, including stock lending, leverage and trade execution. Custodians safeguard their clients’ assets.

"Interest rate rises set back European bank M&A by two years","Accounting rules mean mergers would lead to assets being revalued at significantly lower levels","Rising interest rates have set back European bank mergers and acquisitions by at least two years, dealmakers warn, as a punitive feature of accounting rules means a long-awaited consolidation in the sector faces even higher hurdles. Dealmakers had bet higher rates would provide more cash for acquisitions as banks benefited from better margins and a boost to their share prices as profitability improved. Many had also hoped UBS’s state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse could spark similar deals between other national champions.  However, banks across the continent have vast stocks of corporate and consumer loans, as well as government debt, that were sold in a much lower-rate environment. As part of any acquisition, those assets would have to be marked to market and valued significantly lower than newer loans issued at more lucrative rates. “Accounting rules and their impact on capital are a big hindrance for M&A at the moment,” said Dirk Lievens, head of the European financial institutions group at Goldman Sachs. Under international accounting rules, once a takeover is complete, the acquired company’s assets and liabilities are reappraised at market rates under a process that is known as the purchase price allocation. If a company is bought for less than the value of its assets — as most European banks are traded — the acquirer benefits from an accounting gain known as negative goodwill, or badwill. But that gain can be wiped out if the asset values drop as part of the purchase price allocation process. “With rates rising, you have negative fair value adjustment when marking assets to market upon acquisition and part of the badwill evaporates,” said Lievens. He added: “If you are buying a bank at a discount to book value and the purchase price allocation reduces that, what you thought was capital — ie badwill — is not capital any more. You would then have to top up the capital, which makes doing bank deals more complicated at the moment.”  The speed of the increases in the UK and Europe have also contributed to the accounting issues. A slower pace would have meant a higher proportion of the loans books would have been refinanced over time, easing the capital impact. For more than a decade, almost every major European lender has traded at a discount to the book value of their assets as they struggle with high costs and low profitability. Investors, regulators and politicians all called for consolidation in the fragmented industry with multiple combinations explored, from UniCredit buying Société Générale or Deutsche Bank absorbing its domestic rival Commerzbank.  But none made it over the line until UBS’s enforced takeover of Credit Suisse in March. That deal was subject to a $13bn fair value adjustment, reducing UBS’s badwill gain, the bank reported this month. “The combination of rapidly rising rates and fair value accounting treatment has created a near-term obstacle to bank M&A,” said Andreas Lindh, co-head of the Emea financial institutions group at JPMorgan. “Accounting rules stipulate that acquirers have to make fair value adjustments to targets’ assets and liabilities at the time of acquisition, an issue that is particularly pronounced for long-dated loans and hold to maturity securities written or acquired at significantly lower rates.  “The negative fair value adjustments creates an upfront capital headwind for the acquirer making the M&A maths less appealing.” One of the few major deals that had been struck in Europe is foundering for this reason.  In June 2021 — when the ECB rate was zero — US private equity group Cerberus agreed to buy HSBC’s French consumer business for a token €1. However, last month the bank warned Cerberus may pull out of the deal because “significant, unexpected” rate rises to 3.5 per cent meant “related fair value accounting treatment on acquisition . . . will significantly increase the amount of capital required”. The major issue is long-dated consumer loans, particularly 30-year mortgages, that make up the bulk of the €21.5bn lending book, said a person familiar with the matter. Cerberus would have to mark to market the mortgages that were issued with base rates at zero, leaving them valued considerably lower than those currently being issued at higher rates of interest. Therefore in order to secure regulatory approval for the deal, it would have to inject more capital on day one. While over time the mortgage book would become more lucrative as it is refinanced and repriced, the steep initial impact could cause Cerberus to withdraw. The two sides are in negotiations to see if there is some way to mitigate the capital impact for Cerberus with an alternate deal structure, but a person involved described the deal as “in the balance”. While the logic for combinations remains the same, the rise in rates mean most executives are opting to use their excess capital not for deals, but to pay dividends and repurchase their own stock. UniCredit chief executive Andrea Orcel — a career dealmaker who made his reputation facilitating huge mergers during the financial crisis 15 years ago — has eschewed several potential deals both domestically and internationally, saying that in the current environment “no deal makes sense”. Instead, with UniCredit’s stock trading at a 40 per cent discount to its book value, Orcel has instead been repeatedly increasing a share buyback programme.  While a “deal would not derail UniCredit’s buyback capacity in the near-term given [its] strong starting position . . . [b]uybacks remain a low-risk way for UniCredit to deploy capital. Management’s disciplined approach to date provides comfort,” said Jefferies analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford.","30.05.2023"
"Credit Suisse privately challenged Finma’s AT1 writedown ","Swiss bank contested regulator’s justification for wiping out $17bn of bonds","Credit Suisse directly disputed the Swiss financial regulator’s basis for writing down $17bn of its additional tier 1 bonds, in a private letter aimed at sparing staff bonuses that were tied to the debt. Investors representing at least $4.5bn of wiped-out Credit Suisse AT1 bonds filed a lawsuit against Finma last month, seeking to overturn the Swiss regulator’s cancellation of their holdings that was imposed as part of the bank’s shotgun marriage to UBS two months ago.  The aggrieved bondholders earlier this month forced Finma to hand over a decree it had issued to Credit Suisse on March 19 — the day the UBS merger was struck — ordering the bank to write down the AT1 bonds.   The decree made clear that the regulator believed a “viability event” — a term in the contract requiring a writedown — had been triggered because government-backed liquidity facilities had also bolstered the bank’s capital. However, bondholders also compelled Finma to hand over a subsequent decree issued on March 22 that makes clear that Credit Suisse disagreed with this interpretation of the contracts. The second decree refers to a letter Credit Suisse sent to Finma on March 20 arguing that the contractual conditions had not been met for a writedown, stating: “[Credit Suisse Group] further argues that no contractual ‘viability event’ occurred because the state support did not have a capitalising effect.” Thomas Werlen, a partner at Quinn Emanuel leading the litigation against Finma, described the language as “quite stark” and said the document was “even more helpful” to bondholders’ cause than the earlier decree. “Both sides of the contract say the same thing: the drafter and the reader — i.e. Credit Suisse and the investors — are in agreement,” he added. “Only a third party — Finma — interpreted it differently.” This letter was aimed at sparing Credit Suisse’s senior bankers’ so-called contingent capital awards, a portion of their bonuses that were linked to the AT1s. Credit Suisse “advised against” Finma ordering a writedown of the CCAs in its letter, but the regulator disagreed and responded that the AT1-linked instruments were also covered by its earlier decree.  AT1s are a type of hybrid debt instrument created after the financial crash of 2008 to give banks greater capital flexibility in the event of crises. The second decree was published in full online last week by Antigua News, a local news outlet. The Financial Times separately obtained a copy of the decree and verified its authenticity with several people with direct knowledge of the situation. Credit Suisse and Finma declined to comment. The document also casts fresh light on why the Swiss government felt it necessary to pass an emergency ordinance over the weekend giving Finma the ability to order Credit Suisse to write down the bonds. People close to the litigation noted that this may have been required because the Swiss bank did not agree with Finma’s interpretation of the contracts. The FT reported earlier on Monday that Credit Suisse staff are making preparations to sue the Swiss financial regulator over $400mn of bonuses in the former CCAs that were cancelled following the bank’s rescue by UBS.

"Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders sue Swiss regulator in new lawsuit ","Law firm Pallas says Finma had no authority to issue emergency ordinance","Investors holding about $1.7bn of Credit Suisse bonds that were written down after the bank’s shotgun marriage to UBS have emerged as another group suing Switzerland’s banking regulator, ratcheting up the legal fight following the emergency rescue.  Pallas, a law firm representing two groups of Credit Suisse bondholders in Switzerland, said on Tuesday that it had filed legal action against Finma on April 18 over an emergency ordinance that prioritised shareholders over additional tier one (AT1) bondholders. Pallas has been instructed to pursue compensation on behalf of about 90 institutional investors and asset managers holding more than $1.35bn in AT1 bonds and about 700 retail and family offices holding approximately $300mn.   The latest suit means that investors representing up to a third of the $17bn in AT1s issued by Credit Suisse have now launched legal action.  It comes after the bondholders were wiped out by the emergency takeover brokered by Swiss regulators in March, while shareholders were handed $3.25bn in UBS shares in an apparent reversal of debt recovery norms. AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet. Pallas said on Tuesday that Finma had no authority to issue an emergency ordinance that affected the writedown of the bonds, adding that the ordinance should be invalidated and the AT1 notes restated. Partner Natasha Harrison said the Swiss administrative courts would be asked to consider whether Finma’s actions constituted a violation of bondholders’ property rights.  “We are working with a significant number of AT1 investors to execute a multi-jurisdictional litigation strategy to secure compensation and redress for our clients. The purported writedown of the AT1s was unlawful, and our clients must be fully compensated,” she said. “Finma didn’t have the authority to issue the order to write down the bonds; this was an abuse of process and the resolution procedure should not be used by Switzerland to enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse to the detriment of AT1 holders,” she added.  The legal action is just one line of battle being waged by investors over the fallout from Credit Suisse’s dramatic unravelling. A separate group of bondholders, represented by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, filed their own legal challenge against Finma last month.  Pallas is working with Swiss lawyers Tomas Poledna and Urs Saxer and has engaged Swiss firm Lalive to advise on contractual and capital markets law in relation to potential legal action against Credit Suisse and UBS.  Harrison is already fighting litigation against Credit Suisse on behalf of bondholders suing the bank over Mozambique’s $2bn “tuna bonds” scandal. She is also representing investors in the Swiss bank’s Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds in a class-action lawsuit against Credit Suisse.  Credit Suisse said last week that efforts to reclaim investors’ money in the funds lent by Greensill could take until 2031. Lalive is representing investors in the Greensill lawsuit, while the Geneva firm has also acted on behalf of former Georgian prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili in his long-running dispute with the bank.","02.05.2023"
"Barclays warns former staff in bid to stem investment bank exodus","Departure of about 30 bankers in US risks undermining UK lender’s Wall Street ambitions","Barclays is fighting to stem an exodus from its investment bank after around 30 of its bankers in the US quit to join rivals this year, departures which risk damaging the British lender’s ambitions to compete with larger Wall Street firms.  Barclays’ human resources department has been warning bankers who leave the company not to try to poach their colleagues, according to people familiar with the matter.  So far, Barclays has struggled to stop a steady flow of departures with more than half a dozen more managing directors leaving in recent weeks, including Michael Gingue and Sam Jackson, who are moving to Jefferies, and Derek Keller, who is joining UBS, the people said.   They add to a number of other exits this year. Global investment banking chair John Miller is one of more than a dozen Barclays bankers who has joined Jefferies, while top dealmaker Marco Valla went to UBS to become the Swiss lender’s global co-head of investment banking. Valla was previously global head of technology, media and telecom, and consumer investment banking at Barclays.  “I’ve never seen an exodus as large as this,” said one banker who recently left Barclays.  Inside Barclays, bankers blame the recent upheaval on the decision at the start of the year to replace Miller and Jean-Francois Astier as co-heads of the investment bank.  Barclays appointed Taylor Wright, most recently co-head of global capital markets, and Cathal Deasy, who joined from Credit Suisse, to co-run the business. Miller stepped back to a chair role before leaving for Jefferies, while Astier was named global head of the financial sponsor business.  Senior insiders say the appointments were a strategic decision to usher in a new generation in the leadership team with a different focus than the bank has had in the past.  Historically, Barclays’ investment bank, which in the US was built around the 2008 acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ North American business, has been weighted more towards debt capital markets.   The bank wants to expand more into equities and advisory work, particularly given the rise in interest rates, the growing strength of boutique investment banks and private credit funds, and the opportunities in emerging sectors such as tech and renewable energy.  “When you make this change, it’s not just about just hiring specialists, it’s also about the leadership being attuned to what this world is going to look like,” said one senior Barclays executive.  And while Miller and Astier were both based in New York, Barclays has gone back to having one of its two co-heads — Deasy — based in Europe. “Just having a co-head of banking that works in that milieu, connected to that client base more naturally is helpful,” the senior Barclays executive said.  But in the early months, the changes have caused tumult among bankers who did not get senior jobs or were loyal to the previous leadership.   In response, Barclays has hired around 20 bankers at the director and managing director level so far this year in its investment bank, including software banker Douglas Melsheimer from Goldman Sachs and equity markets banker Foruhar Madjlessi from Instone Real Estate Group.   Jefferies and UBS declined to comment.  In a statement, Barclays said it has a growth strategy to break into the top five largest investment banks and “a key component is attracting and retaining top talent with the right leadership to take our business into the future”.   “In investment banking we announced a new leadership team in the first quarter and we expect and plan for natural attrition when changes occur. We are confident in our strategy, will continue to invest in talent, and we are committed to supporting and helping clients navigate today’s economic environment,” the bank said.  In 2022, Barclays was ranked as the sixth highest-earning investment bank globally, leapfrogging a deeply wounded Credit Suisse but trailing the five largest US investment banks, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.  Convincing investors of the merits of Barclays’ investment banking business is central to chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan’s efforts to boost the bank’s share price. The departures are notable at a time when hiring across Wall Street has slowed amid a dearth of dealmaking, which has led some banks including Goldman and Morgan Stanley to cut jobs. For one senior investment banker at a competitor, the exodus was a reminder “how fragile investment banks are”. ","10.06.2023"
"Inside UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse","The FT’s banking editor Stephen Morris takes us inside the deal that led to UBS’s takeover of its local rival Credit Suisse","This is an audio transcript of the Behind the Money podcast episode: ‘Inside UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse’ Michela Tindera It started with a simple question.  Interview clip I’m wondering whether you would be open to assisting further if there was another call for additional liquidity from Credit Suisse.   Michela Tindera That question was for the then chairman of Saudi National Bank, Ammar Alkhudairy. He sat down for a television interview on Wednesday, March 15th. Saudi National Bank had recently become the largest investor in the prestigious yet troubled bank Credit Suisse. And the FT’s banking editor, Stephen Morris, says a lot was riding on how he responded.  Ammar Alkhudairy The answer is absolutely not.  Michela Tindera This interview was taking place just a few days after Silicon Valley Bank failed and the entire global banking system had been put into question.  Stephen Morris Those comments really set off a firestorm of media attention, client withdrawals, share price falling, its bonds plunging to trade at distressed levels. A lot of people, both inside and outside the bank, link these comments as being the proximate cause of Credit Suisse’s demise.  Michela Tindera After these comments came out, things started to look so bad for Credit Suisse that it seemed like they could go bankrupt. And a Credit Suisse collapse could have been the tipping point for havoc in the entire global financial system.  Stephen Morris If it goes bankrupt, we’ll have chaos in financial markets. It’s a huge bank with connections throughout the financial system, including to other banks, hedge funds, ordinary depositors. It would have been absolute carnage. So the stakes couldn’t really be higher.   Michela Tindera So how did it avoid absolute carnage? Just look across town in Zurich to Credit Suisse’s top rival, UBS.  Stephen Morris Well, if you’d asked me, I guess two months ago, if the Swiss would ever allow their two largest banks to merge, I would have said no.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money, we’re bringing you the inside story of how two Swiss banks and their government raced against the clock to avoid a global banking meltdown.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  UBS has been Credit Suisse’s closest rival for years, in more ways than one.   Stephen Morris These two banks have sat there for centuries on the same square in the centre of Zurich called Paradeplatz. They’re both on different sides of the square, both looking out into the centre, kind of facing each other, but also kind of next to each other. The style of the buildings are very different. UBS’s has been redesigned and is sleek and modern and glass and metal, whereas Credit Suisse’s is much more old, grandiose architecture, small, narrow warren-like corridors and more old Switzerland than new.  Michela Tindera UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse is the culmination of a rivalry that’s existed for a long time. But well before UBS would eventually rescue Credit Suisse, things looked quite different. Let me take you back about 15 years, back to the beginning of the global financial crisis, where a lot of the stories on this show have their origins.  [MUSIC PLAYING] So it’s 2008 and UBS is in some hot water.  Stephen Morris UBS was the bad boy of Swiss banking.  Michela Tindera At the time, UBS is Switzerland’s largest bank. And essentially it’s a mess. It’s posting big losses and writedowns. Investors are losing confidence, and Switzerland’s reputation as a banking haven is taking a hit. That all comes to a head in October 2008.  Stephen Morris It had to be bailed out by the government.  Michela Tindera The Swiss government pumps billions into the bank to help recapitalise it, and that makes Swiss taxpayers very unhappy. Meanwhile, UBS’s rival Credit Suisse makes it out alive, receiving new capital from private investors instead of the government.  Stephen Morris Credit Suisse survived. Credit Suisse was the good one.  Michela Tindera So 2008 comes and goes and UBS has a lot of work to do to get back on track.  Stephen Morris UBS learnt some very hard lessons, removed all of its management, largely shut down the trading and risky operations of its investment bank, focused on wealth management and then spent the best part of the next, I would say, five to 10 years cleaning up scandals, overturning the risk culture of the group and generally trying to amend for the wrongs that it had done to Swiss citizens and Switzerland’s reputation as a country.  Michela Tindera UBS emerged from the financial crisis humbled. And Credit Suisse may have seemed untouchable, but Stephen says there’s an often used maxim in finance that would foreshadow the events to come.  Stephen Morris If you wanna look at the banks that will get into trouble in the next crisis, it’s not gonna be the ones that failed in the last one. It’s gonna be the ones that didn’t and weren’t forced to make, you know, tough changes and perhaps got a little bit overconfident.  Michela Tindera And fast forward to 2023. Now, these two rivals have swapped places.  Stephen Morris UBS has largely repaired itself. Its share price is good. Its leadership is stable. Its strategy is generally liked by the market. And Credit Suisse is the basketcase, with a new scandal coming out every week damaging its reputation.  Michela Tindera Late last year on the show, I talked with the FT’s European banking correspondent, Owen Walker, about a lot of Credit Suisse’s troubles. During that episode, Owen outlined the bank’s latest gameplan. It included things like severe cost-cutting and selling off its investment banking division. But that plan crashed and burned.  Stephen Morris It wasn’t enough. It wasn’t convincing enough in terms of a change in strategy, and it wasn’t executed fast enough. Credit Suisse has had, I think now, three restructuring plans in the last two years and I think seven in the last decade. So very few of their restructuring plans have ever actually worked and turned the bank around and turned it into a profitable, well-run, honourable institution.  Michela Tindera Credit Suisse was facing a crisis of confidence. Even so, it did manage to get an infusion of money from a big new investor late last year.  Stephen Morris The Saudi National Bank — very deep pocketed, strong links to the state. And it was intended to be a new cornerstone investor to take out all those people shorting its stock and to back them.  Michela Tindera So the bank had some reprieve going into this year. But just a few months in, Silicon Valley Bank collapses.  Stephen Morris And that puts the whole market on edge. So Credit Suisse at this point is fragile. It can’t afford any more mis-steps.  Michela Tindera And then Credit Suisse starts to have this PR issue with the then chairman of the Saudi National Bank.  Stephen Morris He goes on television at Saudi Arabia’s big financials conference and is asked by a journalist, if Credit Suisse needs any more capital, considering the market jitters, would you put any more in? And he answers, “Absolutely not.”  Michela Tindera That’s the clip from March 15th that you heard at the beginning of the episode.  Stephen Morris He then does go on to qualify and talk about regulatory reasons, and says he doesn’t think Credit Suisse needs any more capital. But that is the kind of snapshot that everyone, journalists around the world report.  Michela Tindera So suddenly in the middle of all this banking chaos, it looks like Credit Suisse’s biggest shareholder isn’t backing it.  Stephen Morris And that, I think, really is the catalyst for clients to lose even more faith.  Michela Tindera After that interview airs on Wednesday, things turn from bad to worse.  News clip Credit Suisse appears to be the latest on the brink . . .  News clipShares in Credit Suisse plunged to a record low, falling 24 per cent.  Michela Tindera It’s all happening really fast — so fast that the very same day the Swiss central bank decides it needs to step in to prevent a catastrophe. So the top execs at Credit Suisse — that’s Ulrich Körner, the CEO, and Axel Lehmann, the chairman — are summoned to the country’s central bank.  Stephen Morris And they were told that they were gonna be getting this liquidity line, which they’d been lobbying for, which they thought was great.  Michela Tindera That liquidity line was SFr50bn. So maybe Credit Suisse is out of the woods after all?  Stephen Morris But however, in the same meeting, the central bank delivered a very different message, which a person who was involved remembers, told the FT: You will merge with UBS and you will announce this on Sunday evening before the Asian market opens. And this is not optional. So they were given an ultimatum. This credit line was not to save Credit Suisse. It was to stave off bankruptcy until the weekend so they could merge with UBS.  Michela Tindera Wow. So let’s recap here. Essentially what’s just happened is the central bank, along with the regulator Finma and the country’s finance minister, have given Credit Suisse this deadline. The bank has just four days — Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday — to work out a deal to merge with its top rival before Asian markets open on Monday.  Stephen Morris The stakes are incredibly high because over the previous weekend, Silicon Valley Bank has to be saved by a combination of US regulators and private companies. Now we’re going into another weekend with a much larger, globally systemic financial institution, as Credit Suisse is known, could potentially go bankrupt.  Michela Tindera So what happened next? So Credit Suisse knows that they have to merge with UBS. Does UBS know this?  Stephen Morris UBS doesn’t know this yet, but they have their suspicions. The chairman of UBS is a very interesting character, a guy called Colm Kelleher — Irish, but very American in his outlook. He’s an irascible character. Yeah, very smart and very well thought of in global markets. And he has been preparing behind the scenes for an emergency 9-1-1 call from the regulators to save Credit Suisse. They kind of had an inkling that this might happen. But on Wednesday, when the credit line was given, they didn’t know anything about it yet.  The first Colm Kelleher ever found out about it was at 4pm on Thursday, the following day, when he was instructed that the government and regulators and central bank wanted UBS to come up with a plan for Credit Suisse. And that’s really when everything started to accelerate.  Michela Tindera OK, but does UBS even want this deal? Do they have any say in this?  Stephen Morris UBS has been steadfast in its position that it does not want to merge with Credit Suisse. It has its own plan. It’s doing quite well. And they don’t want any part of what they think is a quite rancid culture over at Credit Suisse. But ultimately, when your government comes to you and says, we want you to do this, you have limited room for manoeuvre. So UBS sets about trying to get itself the best deal it can and the deal that protects it and its shareholders from any of the toxicity that might come across from Credit Suisse as part of it.  Michela Tindera So the banks both hire advisers to help them get a good deal. But keep in mind that they’re trying to keep things quiet. And that means code names.  Stephen Morris So UBS, they came up with two code names based around trees. Credit Suisse was Cedar, and UBS was Ulmus, which is the Latin word for an elm tree. And on the other side, Credit Suisse came up with lake-based monikers for each part of the deal. Credit Suisse called itself Como after Lake Como, and UBS was Geneva after the, obviously the lake in Switzerland. Obviously, this didn’t do much for keeping the deal secret because the Financial Times managed to find out about most of it as it was happening.  Michela Tindera So by Friday morning . . .  Stephen Morris Both sides are working with their code names on the different facets of the deal. UBS isn’t really talking to Credit Suisse. As far as it’s concerned, it’s negotiating with the government and the central bank and the regulators. It’s not interested in talking to executives at Credit Suisse that have lost control of their own destiny at this point. They have no power. This is incredibly frustrating for Credit Suisse, of course, because as far as they’re concerned, a few days ago, they were executives in charge of one of the world’s largest and most prestigious banks.  Michela Tindera Now, the deadline for this merger is a mere two days away. And UBS is trying to squeeze all it can from this deal.  Stephen Morris UBS is gonna wanna pay the least it possibly can for its rival, and it’s gonna want to secure the maximum amount of government support, both in terms of liquidity lines, but also guarantees and indemnities for what they might find at Credit Suisse because, remember, 72 hours is not a long time to look at a massive global financial institution and conclude what it’s worth and if there are any unexploded bombs there on the balance sheet, which could come back to haunt them. And we’ve seen this in financial crises in the past. And they also want the government to help cover some of the potential losses because winding down big banks like this is very expensive. You have to decommission IT systems, you have to compensate clients, you have to pay off staff with redundancy when you fire them. So it’s locked in negotiations with the government saying, OK, we’re the only option to save Credit Suisse, this is what we need to do it.  Michela Tindera The FT also finds out that asset management firm BlackRock is considering ways to carve up Credit Suisse. But almost as soon as BlackRock’s planes touch down in Zurich . . .  Stephen Morris BlackRock gets a pretty severe message from the Swiss establishment saying: we want a Swiss solution to this. We do not want a foreign firm coming in and carving up one of our national icons. So thank you very much for your interest, but we will be sorting this out ourselves. So BlackRock, pack up and fly out.  Michela Tindera While this is happening on Friday, Stephen and some of our colleagues have been keeping tabs with their sources.  Stephen Morris I think it was around 9.15pm, we put out a story saying UBS is in talks to take over the whole of Credit Suisse. This isn’t just one or two units. This isn’t a partnership. This is a full-scale takeover. The world has suspected that this is happening, but it’s the first time anyone’s confirmed this. And obviously the two banks retreat further into their war rooms and work all night on this.  Michela Tindera Which brings us to Saturday. Less than 48 hours until markets in Asia open and still, there’s no deal.  Stephen Morris UBS still really isn’t talking to Credit Suisse.  Michela Tindera And on top of this, the Swiss government is feeling pressure from around the world.  Stephen Morris When a global financial institution gets into stress, there are a lot of other parties that are interested as well. Credit Suisse has big operations in New York and around the US, in London, in Singapore, and everybody around the world wants to make sure that their little part of the bank is protected if there is a bankruptcy. Janet Yellen over in the US, Sam Woods, Andrew Bailey at the Bank of England, Andrea Enria at the European Central Bank — they do not want a bank to collapse. In fact, one of our sources described them as kicking the shit out of the Swiss to act as quickly as they could because it was gonna become much bigger than one bank in Switzerland very quickly if there was a failure, because as we know, fear or lack of confidence spreads very quickly in financial markets and it could have caused — the word is contagion — it could have caused a much, much larger crisis dragging down several other weaker banks in the US and around Europe.  Michela Tindera So the Swiss government knows what they have to do. But Stephen says they have another obstacle to clear.  Stephen Morris We’ve also found out that the Swiss government is planning to pass legislation to essentially sidestep the normal six-week consultation period and vote for shareholders of both companies. They need to get this done by the end of the weekend and they can’t risk shareholders not voting for it. So they’re actually changing the laws of the whole country to allow them to force through this deal without a proper shareholder vote. And that was and is very controversial.  Michela Tindera So UBS is still deliberating on a deal, but without really talking to Credit Suisse. BlackRock has come and gone. Officials in other countries are throwing in their two cents. And the Swiss government is even trying to change its laws to meet this Sunday deadline. But at this point, with only hours left, an offer price hasn’t even been mentioned.  Stephen Morris The first time a price is actually mentioned, Colm Kelleher comes out of a dinner in Zurich on Saturday night and he calls his counterpart at Credit Suisse to inform him that UBS was gonna offer $1bn in total in stock for the whole group.  Michela Tindera That offer would have meant that one Credit Suisse share was worth about SFr0.25. Now, keep in mind that even after the rocky week that the bank had just gone through, its share price was SFr1.86 when the markets closed. So this is a low offer, to say the least.  Stephen Morris Credit Suisse is obviously outraged by this, both in terms of the financial terms, but also it’s kind of an insult as well. Initially, UBS says that’s our offer, take it or leave it.  Michela Tindera Sunday morning, Stephen and our colleagues published a story that reveals UBS’s $1bn offer.  What was the reaction at the time when that story came out?  Stephen Morris Well, the reaction first was disbelief at the low level of the price, especially with the government changing the laws of the country at the same time giving UBS all this kind of indemnity. So we’re wondering at this point if this gets done. I mean, is this just too punchy an offer from UBS to ever be accepted? And are we starting to think about a nationalisation of Credit Suisse instead? We subsequently learned that was never on the cards.  Michela Tindera But essentially, after this $1bn offer comes out, the Swiss central bank, the national regulator Finma and the Swiss finance minister call Credit Suisse and say . . .  Stephen Morris You will sign this deal or we will remove you (chuckle) because we’ve already changed the law of the country. We will remove you as board members, install people that will sign off the deal and you will kind of be a national disgrace. It then goes back to UBS and says, OK, we know that you’re not in trouble. We know that you don’t want this, but you can’t offer 1bn. That’s just too low.  Michela Tindera So UBS doubles their offer to 2bn, and that’s still too low for Credit Suisse to accept. And again, the clock is ticking. But going into Sunday evening . . . [AUDIO CLIP OF A CLOCK TIMER TICKING AND DINGING]  Stephen Morris We hear that this is signed. This is now a done deal. The price has been increased to $3.25bn, about SFr3bn. Essentially, UBS is taking over the whole thing. They’re just gonna swallow the whole thing and sort it out over the next few years.  Michela Tindera Sunday night, there’s a press conference in Bern, Switzerland. The chairs of UBS and Credit Suisse, the country’s finance minister and other regulators attend, and together they announce the deal.  Here’s UBS chair Colm Kelleher:  Colm Kelleher This transaction supports financial stability in Switzerland and creates significant sustainable value for UBS shareholders. Combining the best of Credit Suisse with our strategy and culture will help these businesses flourish. I am pleased that this transaction will bring the long desired stability for the Credit Suisse client base.  Stephen Morris The chairman of UBS is very blunt and says there’s no two ways about it — this is a rescue of Credit Suisse.  Michela Tindera And this is what Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter has to say.  Karin Keller-Sutter I have to say that very clearly, this is no bailout. This is a commercial solution.  Stephen Morris The Swiss are very preoccupied with telling everyone this is not a bailout. This is a commercial deal that has been worked out between two companies in the private sector. Because remember, memories of the 2008 government bailout of UBS are still very fresh among the populace. But I would say the overriding emotion at that press conference is just relief at this point, because I’ve said before, if a big bank like that goes down, both in terms of real financial terms but also confidence in the markets would have been shattered and Monday morning could have been carnage. And remember, on the other side of the Atlantic, there are two more US banks potentially going bankrupt and trying to be rescued by their larger peers. So this is not, this is not happening in a vacuum. This is happening in the context of a lot of global panic about the stability of various banking systems in different countries.  Michela Tindera So on Monday, when markets open . . .  News clip It has been a day of volatility on the global markets following that unprecedented historic banking deal. Now, there were sharp losses in early trading in Asia and Europe, although banking stocks have since rebounded. News clipUBS stocks fell by up to 13 per cent earlier in the day, but they have rallied and they were up by 1.3 per cent at the time of closing.  Stephen Morris Basically, there isn’t this huge ripple effect through financial markets. The last-ditch intervention by the Swiss has actually worked. Credit Suisse isn’t gonna go bankrupt. The clients aren’t gonna lose all of their money. Taxpayers don’t have to contribute. And the global investment banking system isn’t gonna have this big contagion effect through. So actually, it was much better than I personally was thinking. I was bracing for another 24-hour day.  Michela Tindera So, Stephen, now that the dust is settled a little bit, where does this leave UBS?  Stephen Morris It’s kind of strange, you know, because Credit Suisse both does and doesn’t exist. UBS does not own it yet. It’ll take, I think, between two to four months to fully clear everything and for them to take control. And because when you have 72 but really in 48 hours to make a decision about something, you haven’t decided. So I don’t think UBS knows what it’s gonna do with the Credit Suisse brand. Will it retire it completely in disgrace? Or will it try and revive it in some way? I don’t think it knows what it’s gonna do. I mean, there’s still a lot of stuff for them to kind of work through in the coming weeks.  Michela Tindera And what about Credit Suisse?  Stephen Morris Credit Suisse sent a memo to staff saying, you have to come into the office and we will continue to pay you. The Swiss government then did pass legislation saying no more bonuses for Credit Suisse, which I think was unavoidable in the context of the public anger. There have been protests outside Credit Suisse’s office in the centre of Zurich, for example. So it’s in a limbo at the moment. But, you know, as of today, I imagine Axel Lehmann is, you know, sat and probably quite sad in his office on Paradeplatz Square and as is the CEO Ulrich Körner who didn’t even get to be a year in charge before his bank collapsed, and presumably he’ll lose his job.  Michela Tindera What do you think this means for the banking industry at large now that these two banks have merged?  Stephen Morris We don’t know yet. But when you have a big deal like this, that does change the European and global banking landscape. It’s almost like a domino. It can set off an effect where other banks will say, oh, well, a large deal like that is actually possible and can be very advantageous for whoever the buyer is. Maybe we should dust off some of our domestic and cross-border acquisition plans and have a look at them again because they might actually work.  It also changes the competitive landscape. You’re now looking at a much larger bank, especially when all the problems have been sorted out in a couple of years that will be better able to compete and take market share from its rivals. So I’m sure the management teams of their rivals will be looking at what maybe they can do to get bigger in one sort of, as they say, inorganically, not just growing cells, but by buying something else. But that all very much remains to be seen. I mean, Switzerland is a unique country for many reasons, and its banking system is not part of the EU. It’s very different to the UK as well. So it may be that this is just an idiosyncratic rescue of a good bank of a very, very bad one. But certainly it does change the landscape.

"UBS chair rules out more US acquisitions after aborted Wealthfront deal","Colm Kelleher says the Swiss bank can grow in the US by focusing on very wealthy clients","UBS chair Colm Kelleher has ruled out further acquisitions in the US after walking away from a $1.4bn deal two months ago, saying that shareholders need a clear picture of how the Swiss bank will grow in a market it has earmarked as a top priority. The Swiss bank in September ditched plans to buy US digital advisory start-up Wealthfront, a deal that had been championed by chief executive Ralph Hamers, but proved unpopular with investors. “The real short-term gain for us is the states. There has been some tweaking [of strategy], we know we need to grow, UBS is subscale in the US,” Kelleher told the Financial Times global banking summit in London on Wednesday.   “What makes UBS different from Morgan Stanley or Bank of America is that we appeal to the ultra-wealthy. The message in the states is organic growth, no optionality, no distractions, no M&A,” Kelleher added. “We have a clear strategy in the states. Why are we complicating it for our investors?” Former Morgan Stanley executive Kelleher joined UBS in April with a brief to help expand the business and improve the bank’s valuation.  “There is no prospect of UBS growing inorganically in the states . . . we have looked at the various properties in the states where we could scale up, they do not fit our criteria or culture, so we have made a decision to grow organically,” he added. “Where we bring value is high net worth and ultra-high net worth. I don’t think we particularly bring alpha in mass-affluent, which is why we walked away mutually from the Wealthfront deal . . . it didn’t make sense,” said Kelleher. In a wide-ranging interview, Kelleher also denied rumours that he had fallen out with Hamers over strategy and style. “I really don’t get this . . . I was 32 years at Morgan Stanley, and in all that time we never had anything like the blogs and gossip that comes out of Zurich,” he said. “There was a feeling in UBS I would be some Wall Street shoot-from-the-hip type guy and Ralph and I would clash. We actually get on phenomenally well. We are very complementary. Banking isn’t about personality, it is about fit.”  Kelleher has taken Hamers on a series of investor roadshows, with the aim of enticing US fund managers to become shareholders and raise the group’s price-to-book ratio, which lags behind US competitors such as JPMorgan and his former employer. UBS’s main rival Credit Suisse has gone through several chaotic, scandal-ridden years and recently announced that clients had withdrawn SFr84bn ($89bn) of assets. Credit Suisse’s shares hit a 30-year low this week. “We are not actively benefiting at their expense. We view them as a worthy competitor going through a crisis,” said Kelleher. “But clearly we are also in a world of clients moving money around, so where clients proactively approach us we either let the money come to us or we let it go to our American competitors.” Kelleher recently attracted controversy at an investment conference in Hong Kong where he said global bankers were all “very pro-China”. The UBS chair was one of several heads of international banks who spoke at the event this month, where Chinese officials had sought to woo rattled international investors. In a joking response to comments made earlier in the day by a Chinese regulator about international media’s perception of the country, Kelleher said: “We’re not reading the American press, we actually buy the [China] story.”  On Wednesday, he reiterated his optimism about the country, despite the anti-government protests that have sprung up in numerous cities. “We are confident that 2023 will be a year where you will get some relaxation on zero-Covid and the market will kick back into gear and we are seeing that with the build-up of liquidity with our customers.” He said wealthy clients at UBS were holding more cash than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008. “[On] The US I am not as negative as some . . . I am relatively constrictive on the [Federal Reserve], we will have a shallow recession, the Fed is getting control of inflation . . . Rates will stay higher for longer . . . but nevertheless it doesn’t presage the doom-laden scenarios that we have seen. 2023 you will see money going back to work” UBS has been one of the strongest European banks in recent years, as its wealthy client base’s portfolios swelled on the back of central bank interventions during the pandemic. However, Kelleher was less positive on Europe, saying that Brexit and the stalling of the EU banking union project meant lending would be likely to slow down dramatically in a recession.  “I think Europe is going to be relatively sterile ground for the future,” he concluded.","30.11.2022"

"Credit Suisse takeover risks limiting choice for Swiss start-ups, warns On Running","Premium athletic brand used bank and its rival UBS when it listed in 2021 ","Premium Swiss athletic brand On Running has warned that UBS’s acquisition of rival Credit Suisse risks limiting choice for start-ups in the country when they eventually seek to list.  Both UBS and Credit Suisse underwrote On Running’s equity when it launched its initial public offering in 2021. The company has gone on to become a New York-listed global fitness brand whose running shoes and kit are popular with young professionals and professional athletes. On Tuesday it reported annual sales of more than £1bn for the first time in its history. However, the company’s co-chief executive Martin Hoffmann said he was concerned that the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, orchestrated by the Swiss government on Sunday, would lead to a lack of choice and competition for local companies wishing to list in the future. “I think we need to look at the environment in Switzerland carefully,” he added. “As a young brand back in the day we benefited a lot from having two banks to have the competition, but also the options.”  On Running reported sales growth of 69 per cent to SFr1.2bn ($1.3bn), with pre-tax profit of SFr78mn for 2022.  “We clearly see that running is hot at the moment,” said Hoffmann. “At the same time wearing athletic shoes and apparel in a daily environment is a clear trend that On is benefiting from,” he added in a nod to the city bankers who style the performance shoes with suits. Hoffmann, whose trainers typically sell for between SFr200 and SFr300, argued that the cost of living crisis in Europe was pushing more people towards running as a cheaper alternative to other forms of exercise. “In the end, running is one of the cheapest ways to do sports compared to a gym subscription or bikes. Even in an economically difficult environment running is a sport that is growing.” On Running has also expanded its reach into tennis, with former world number one Roger Federer helping to design a range of tennis and casual shoes and becoming a brand ambassador. It also announced a sponsorship deal with the women’s number one player Iga Świątek, who will be “head to toe in On Running” when she plays at Wimbledon this year. On Running has 15 stores in China, which it plans to increase to 20 by the end of the year, and its London flagship outlet opened in February. More than half of sales come from North America, with just under a third from Europe.  It was valued at $7.3bn when it listed in New York but the group’s share price has since fallen by almost half. It was trading at around $22 per share on Tuesday before the market open. ","21.03.2023"
"Heads roll at Credit Suisse’s final shareholder meeting","Plus, L’Oréal agrees its biggest deal ever and Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan finds itself in multiple courtroom dramas","One thing to start: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and a raft of other lenders on Wall Street have lost roughly $1.5bn financing the leveraged buyout of Citrix, with the sale of junior debt on Tuesday generating a loss of about $675mn alone. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Credit Suisse shareholders sound offL’Oréal cleans up with a new dealJamie Dimon’s busy week Credit Suisse shareholders take the mic “After the financial crisis we were named the ‘Best Bank Globally’,” said Credit Suisse’s chair Axel Lehmann, scanning the hall for effect — or perhaps, support — as he paused to let the notion sink in. “The years since . . . that is the bitter reality.”   The Financial Times’ Sam Jones joined more than 1,700 CS shareholders at its annual meeting on Tuesday morning, filling the stalls of the Hallenstadion on the outskirts of Zurich to commemorate the end of the 167-year-old lender.  It has been barely a fortnight since the Swiss government forced its emergency sale to rival UBS. Lehmann and chief executive Ulrich Körner were at pains to emphasise their remorse. “The bitterness, anger, and shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments of the past few weeks is palpable,” said Lehmann.  A shareholder watches on as Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann speaks at the bank’s final shareholder meeting © Michael Buholzer/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Körner set an even more funereal tone: “We didn’t succeed. We ran out of time. This fills me with sorrow. What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come.”  Three police vans stood by outside in case the solemn gathering of stockholders who had collectively lost billions became disorderly. But few in the crowd looked like they’d be causing trouble. Two women stood to one side of the entrance holding a banner: “Reparations for Mozambique Now!”, referencing the infamous “tuna bond” scandal. Indoors, the audience listened to the opening statements mostly in respectful silence, interrupted only by the occasional jeer or catcall.   When time came for questions and speeches from the floor, there was less holding back. Shareholder after shareholder, from Swiss pensioners to international fund managers; young socialists and the scions of millionaire clients, repeatedly questioned how such a disaster could’ve happened. Some of the more forensic questions raised at the podium pointed to issues that may yet keep CS’s management and board up at night: Why wasn’t more done months ago? Did the government pressure the sale? And was any internal analysis done on whether the $3.25bn UBS paid was a fair valuation? The answers left most attendees unsatisfied. But a Swiss parliamentary inquiry is now looming, state prosecutors are circling and some CS debtholders have begun preparing litigation. Several members of the CS board — Shan Li, Seraina Macia, Blythe Masters, Richard Meddings and Ana Paula Pessoa — all decided to step down rather than face re-election.  At one point, a speaker suggested the bank’s board would have been crucified in medieval times, while another compared walnuts and empty coconut husks to the price of a CS share. The aforementioned coconut husks © Bloomberg As the meeting drew to a close, there was little sense of closure. Rather, the five hours of talking had only added to the sense of faint unreality. (The FT’s Owen Walker live tweeted the event.)  CS’s shares were once nearly SFr80 each, Daniel Engler, one shareholder noted. “The price of a chateaubriand.” Now, he lamented, “They’re the price of a croissant!” Soap sells at L’Oréal  The era of cheap money has come to an end. That doesn’t yet mean consumers are paring back their purchases of $41 hand soaps. L’Oréal this week agreed to its largest deal ever, scooping up high-end cosmetics group Aesop as its former owner attempts to cut its debt burden. The sale, valued at $2.3bn, will go some way as Natura & Co attempts to restructure itself and revitalise performance after it went on an international acquisition spree during the previous decade. Companies like Natura are quickly finding out how expensive debt is now that central banks across the globe have tightened policy. To that point, the company’s chief executive Fábio Barbosa recently told the FT that the cosmetics conglomerate would concentrate on bolstering cash flows instead of chasing sales growth. Aesop will join a stable of high-end brands already owned by L’Oréal, including Lancôme and Kiehl’s, helping it compete with rivals like US-listed Estée Lauder, which acquired boutique luxury fragrance and cosmetics maker Le Labo in 2014. L’Oréal is betting it can double Aesop’s annual sales from €502mn to €1bn or more. The deal is a departure for L’Oréal in one respect. The company has generally sought out smaller brands that it believes it can grow quickly, such as when it bought budget skincare group CeraVe for $1.3bn in 2017. A big advantage of brands like Aesop, as Lex points out, are their steep profit margins: luxe soaps are cheap to make despite their hefty price tags. Aesop’s gross margin tops that of L’Oréal itself at a sudsy 87.1 per cent. Keeping up with Jamie Dimon For all of the legal scrutiny Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase are under this week, there was a sliver of good news. The bank, which is fighting allegations from the US Virgin Islands that it benefited from the sex trafficking operation of its former client Jeffrey Epstein, early on Tuesday learned that US prosecutors had arrested and charged Charlie Javice for conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. Javice had sold JPMorgan a student finance website called Frank for $175mn, but the bank quickly realised that something was amiss after the deal closed. JPMorgan claimed in court filings that it sent out marketing emails to 400,000 Frank users and roughly 70 per cent of them bounced back. The bank sued the 31-year-old founder, accusing her of massively overestimating the number of Frank users before the acquisition.  The indictment filed on Tuesday in US District Court quoted an exchange between a Frank software engineer and Javice in 2021, after she allegedly asked for “an artificial, synthetic data set” of users to be produced.  “I don’t want to do anything illegal,” the employee allegedly responded. “We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits,” Javice allegedly replied. For Javice, who stood to make about $45mn from the sale, the remark hasn’t aged well. The entrepreneur also faces a civil suit from the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Rather than help students, we allege that Ms Javice engaged in an old-school fraud: she lied about Frank’s success in helping millions of students navigate the college financial aid process by making up data to support her claims, and then used that fake information to induce JPMC to enter into a $175mn transaction,” Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said. (JPMorgan declined to comment on the charges. Lawyers for Javice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Javice has denied the bank’s allegations of falsifying accounts in a countersuit.)

"UBS’s Credit Suisse challenge","LVMH becomes the first European company to hit $500bn market value","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘UBS’s Credit Suisse challenge’ Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, April 25th, and this is your FT News Briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING]  Joe Biden is expected today to announce that he wants a second term in office. And Credit Suisse released its final earnings report ever. And the results could mean trouble for UBS. Plus, we’ll talk about the growing fortune of the conglomerate behind Gucci, Dior and Dom Pérignon.  Adrienne KlasaLVMH is the king. I mean, the company has basically lapped the competition.  Marc FilippinoI’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] There could be a Biden-Trump rematch next fall. Joe Biden is expected to announce as early as today that he’s running for a second term as US president. Former president Donald Trump has already put his hat in the ring and he’s currently the leading Republican candidate. Biden has been signalling for a while now that he’s gonna seek a second term. His official launch removes any doubt that he’d run again and also allows him to begin aggressive fundraising. [MUSIC PLAYING]  Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, reports earnings today. We’ll get an idea of how the lender was affected by last month’s banking panic. Now, we do know it has a tricky road ahead. It has to integrate Credit Suisse into its business. Swiss authorities persuaded UBS to buy its smaller rival in a hasty rescue, all while wealthy clients were pulling their money out last month. Yesterday, we got a sense of how bad it was. Credit Suisse said last quarter, customers pulled out nearly $70bn from the bank. Here’s the FT’s Owen Walker.  Owen WalkerBut if you just look at the wealth management business, which is really its strong point, that lost 9 per cent of assets in the first quarter and it lost about 10 per cent the three months previously. So I mean, that was really where the pain was felt. So to lose that much money from its main business, following on from the losses in the final quarter of 2022 was really catastrophic for it.  Marc FilippinoSo Owen, what else did you glean from the earnings report? Did executives say anything interesting on the call?  Owen WalkerWell, this is quite surprising or a very strange calls result. In fact, there was no earnings call and there was no media call. It was literally a press release at quarter to six, my time. With the numbers on there, some brief commentary, no quotes from CEO or chairman or anything like that. It was literally “Here are the numbers and see you later.” This is essentially Credit Suisse’s final quarterly results before it gets taken over by UBS in the coming weeks. And so it was very strange from that perspective.  Marc FilippinoOK. So that’s bizarre and almost anticlimactic in a way, given that it was its last earnings report ever. But did that press release we’re talking about offer any new information about outflows from Credit Suisse even after UBS agreed to buy it? I guess what I’m asking here is, did the deal stop the bleeding?  Owen WalkerYou know, the bank said outflows are continued after the agreed takeover was announced and has continued since then, even though it’s at a lower rate. Now, this I think, this is quite expected. And people weren’t surprised by that, but it does really underline the challenges UBS faces in taking over Credit Suisse.   Marc FilippinoSo what are those challenges, Owen?  Owen WalkerWell, these are two banks which operate on a global scale and smashing together and, you know, laying off tens of thousands of people. It’s gonna be incredibly risky, incredibly time-consuming and quite expensive, and that’s gonna take several years. Now, that’s the main challenge facing UBS. But undoubtedly another very big one is making sure they hold on to as many of Credit Suisse’s clients as possible. And also, in fact, their own, because when you have wealthy clients, they will often diversify their risk. They will often have bank accounts with a number of different wealth managers. Now, a lot of these wealthy clients will have had accounts at both banks. Now, the fact they are soon to become the same entity will mean that actually they probably want to diversify their risk. And so UBS will also have been losing client assets in the month since the deal was announced. So we’ll get a bit of a flavour, I think, on Tuesday about how badly UBS has been affected so far.  Marc FilippinoOwen Walker is the FT’s European banking correspondent. Thanks, Owen. Owen WalkerThanks very much.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc FilippinoBritain’s chancellor said UK corporate taxes are too high. Jeremy Hunt made that comment at a summit with corporate leaders yesterday. It was a Conservative party event meant to win back the business community after the damage done by Brexit. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was there too. Businesses are upset over the government’s decision this month to increase the corporate tax rate from 19 to 25 per cent. Hunt said he would like to bring down the corporate tax burden, but he added the way to do that was, quote, “through growth”. [MUSIC PLAYING] The French luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH, yesterday became the first European company to hit $500bn in market capitalisation. Its earnings and its share price have risen partly because of the economic rebound in China. To find out more, I’m joined by our Paris correspondent, Adrienne Klasa. Hey, Adrienne.  Adrienne KlasaHi, Marc.  Marc FilippinoSo what’s going on in China when it comes to luxury goods?  Adrienne KlasaChina is the biggest growth market for the luxury industry. There’s a huge growing middle class there. There’s a big culture of wanting to purchase luxury goods. So that was really the driver of growth over the past, let’s say, decade or so or the past few years anyway. End of 2022, zero-Covid measures as Covid spread across China, gave a lot of luxury groups a bit of a ding, including LVMH. Now, for 2023, it looks like if the China recovery is already starting to take off, we’re starting to see that boost from the return of Chinese consumers, you know, going back to normal lives and going out shopping and going out and purchasing luxury goods again.  Marc FilippinoNow, Adrienne, how does LVMH compare to other luxury brands? Where does it stand in terms of the broader industry?  Adrienne Klasa(Chuckles) LVMH is the king. I mean, luxury in general has done incredibly well. It’s defied all expectations. I mean, even during the pandemic, in the early days of the pandemic, you know, March 2020, the world locks down, markets crash. There was a bit of a dip there. And then surprising to pretty much everyone, luxury actually accelerated its growth, but LVMH has really led everybody by leaps and bounds. So the company, which owns major brands like Louis Vuitton, like Dior, like Ruinart champagne, all kinds of other brands, has basically lapped the competition. It’s double the size of Hermès, which is its next biggest French competitor in the luxury sector. So this is just a group that is growing by leaps and bounds. It’s also the only European company that is in the top ten global rankings of companies by market capitalisation. So that kind of gives you a sense of the scale that we’re talking about here.  Marc FilippinoOK, so back to the industry as a whole. We know China has been a big boost for LVMH. What do analysts see for the broader industry? Will the good times keep going?  Adrienne KlasaYeah, I mean, so luxury overall is expected to still do very well in 2023. Some concern, though, about a slowing pace of growth in the US. The US is the biggest market overall and it while it’s still expected to grow, that’s expected to be at a slightly slower pace and more mid-market brands are expected to experience a little bit more pressure just because of, you know, inflation and all the other big economic trends that we talk about a lot at the FT. The luxury industry has been growing at just a crazy pace pretty much since March 2020. Most analysts expect that by start of 2024, 2025, it will be a little bit more normalised.

"Why banks must keep faith in their living wills   ","Decision to force Credit Suisse into the arms of UBS has raised doubts over the resolution planning banks are required to do ","Why spend millions of pounds developing a plan to safely manage the collapse of a stricken bank only for it to be ignored when an institution is actually in peril? It is the question executives at some of the world’s biggest lenders were asking on a call organised by the Institute of International Finance in recent weeks, as the industry tries to draw lessons from the way in which Swiss regulators forced Credit Suisse into the arms of domestic rival UBS. Banks’ bewilderment at the shotgun marriage of Switzerland’s largest lenders is understandable. It flies in the face of the regulatory framework imposed since the global financial crisis that requires big banks to make so-called living wills designed to limit the damage to the financial system if they collapse.  Swiss central bank governor Thomas Jordan said that relying on living wills when a bank is actually imploding was not an option in a “extremely fragile environment”.  Given many executives believe the wider environment would have to be extremely fragile for a really major bank to fail, the decision by Swiss regulators has merely confirmed a long-held belief that such resolution plans are merely an academic exercise not worthy of much effort.  “There was frustration,” said one of the more than 100 people who took part on the IIF call. A resolution expert at one large UK bank told the Financial Times that the group is currently spending tens of millions of pounds on small army of consultants to help craft a resolution plan that might never be read, let alone called upon in a crisis. But despite the frustration, it’s far from clear that the actions of Swiss authorities have dealt a hammer blow to the case for resolution planning.  “Resolution planning helps make banks resolvable even if the plans are not followed to the letter when an actual resolution situation happens,” said Nicolas Véron of the Bruegel Institute.  It is a view echoed by regulators. “Even if we never use a resolution plan, the fact that it is there as the default . . . can have a positive impact on the willingness of parties to come to another solution,” one told the FT. The work may be costly and its conclusions left on the shelf when an emergency erupts, but some executives acknowledge there is value in effectively planning for a bank’s funeral. “We produce hundreds and hundreds of pages of the stuff,” says the head of one large UK bank. “Of course you’re not going to follow it, it’s an entirely theoretical exercise. Still, as a framework I don’t think it’s terrible.” The work both creates options if a crisis does strike and allows banks to accumulate knowledge along the way, forcing management to confront potential risks and contemplate the unthinkable.  But the type of risks such plans need to consider may have to widen given how Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank, a Californian lender that US authorities had to shut down, failed.  Both were hit by a crisis of confidence that triggered a catastrophic run on deposits, not a scenario typically envisaged by the resolution planning born from the financial crisis when stricken balance sheets were the problem.   Given technology now allows customers to whip away deposits with a couple of clicks on an app, it’s a risk that banks cannot afford to ignore. With the IMF warning this week of an “acute risk” to the global financial system if stubbornly high inflation forces central banks to keep raising interest rates, this is no time for banks to dismiss resolution planning. Long live living wills. ","14.04.2023"
"UBS chief risk officer quits to become professional photographer","Christian Bluhm has helped Swiss bank avoid major scandals suffered by rival Credit Suisse","UBS’s chief risk officer Christian Bluhm has resigned from the Swiss bank to become a full-time professional photographer. The unusual career change, announced on Tuesday, will lead to Bluhm opening a studio and gallery in Zurich’s historic centre, a short distance from UBS’s headquarters, as he swaps capital ratios for aspect ratios. A mathematician by training, the 53-year-old German will leave the bank in May to focus on his business and other academic opportunities.   He has already launched a website, featuring cityscapes, nature photography, and wedding and beauty shots. On his website, he said his love of photography blossomed after a friend showed him how to take a clear photo of the Big Dipper star constellation in the night sky.  “That experience fascinated me so much that I started a never-ending journey into professional photography,” Bluhm wrote. Bluhm is following in the footsteps of Matthew Greenburgh, the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch dealmaker and adviser on the RBS-ABN Amro and Lloyds Bank-HBOS takeovers, who quit banking in 2010 aged 49 to pursue a career in photography.  Christine Novakovic, UBS’s Europe chief executive, spent two years as an art dealer before joining the Swiss lender in 2007. UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers said he wished Bluhm the best for the future.  “I’d also like to personally thank Christian for his leadership and commitment over the last six years and for the significant contributions he and his team have made to our sustainable performance through active risk management.”   Bluhm has been chief risk officer of UBS since 2016, during which time the bank has avoided being entangled in many of the scandals that have hit its Swiss rival Credit Suisse. UBS did, however, suffer an $861mn loss on the collapse of family office Archegos Capital last year, but that was overshadowed by Credit Suisse’s $5.5bn loss. Both banks had offered prime broking services to the investment business run by former Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang. Hamers has set about reshaping his executive team over the past two years, bringing in a new chief financial officer, a new head of the Americas and giving more power to the head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan. The new chief risk officer will be Damian Vogel, who at present manages risk in the bank’s wealth management business. “With his strong track record, in-depth risk expertise, and experience across all asset classes, Damian is ideally suited to lead our risk function into the future,” Hamers said.

"Wealth manager Azura hires ex-Credit Suisse banker for US push","Veteran Anthony Kontoleon will join the four-year-old firm as a partner in New York","Global wealth management start-up Azura Partners, which manages almost $4bn, is launching a US office and has recruited a former senior Credit Suisse banker to lead the push. Anthony Kontoleon will join the four-year-old firm as a partner in New York, where he will be tasked with finding private markets deals for Azura’s wealthy clients. Kontoleon spent more than 28 years at Credit Suisse where he eventually led the bank’s equity capital markets syndicate. In his time at the Swiss bank, Kontoleon helped raise private capital for companies including Alibaba, Lyft and DraftKings and subsequently worked on their initial public offerings.   The Financial Times reported last year that Kontoleon was removed from his position earlier in 2022 after he was found to have used unapproved messaging applications with clients. Over the past two years, US regulators have cracked down on record-keeping at Wall Street’s banks. The hire is the latest attempt by Azura’s 41-year-old founder Ali Jamal to disrupt the business of private wealth management, which is dominated by heavyweight banks such as UBS and JPMorgan Chase.  Jamal, a Kuwaiti national who served as a lieutenant in its military, worked in private banking at a trio of Swiss banks — BSI, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer — before launching Azura in 2019.  The firm now employs about 40 staff and has offices in Monaco, London, Geneva, Singapore and Dubai. Kontoleon will be Azura’s global head of strategic opportunities.  “Our clients are billionaires and we cannot turn them into trillionaires. But we want to offer them a diversified set of unique opportunities to invest their money,” Jamal told the FT. Kontoleon’s “experience and understanding of the public and private markets will enhance Azura’s offering, providing new solutions for our clients”, he added. Azura will be opening its New York office in the General Motors building, Jamal said.  Credit Suisse, which was beset by scandals in recent years, saw its wealth management business and ambitions eclipsed by UBS. Last month, Swiss regulators orchestrated the stricken bank’s takeover by UBS. ","11.04.2023"
"Swiss lawmakers vote against Credit Suisse rescue in symbolic protest ","MPs oppose SFr109bn government-backed package underpinning UBS’s takeover of rival ","Swiss parliamentarians have voted against a SFr109bn government-backed liquidity package underpinning UBS’s takeover of rival Credit Suisse, in a symbolic move indicative of swelling opposition to the deal. Switzerland’s lower house on Wednesday afternoon voted down the government bill to authorise the bailout, repeating the results of an initial vote held on Tuesday night and rejecting a compromise proposal in a ballot that finalises parliament’s stance on the rescue.  However, the move comes too late to actually stop taxpayers’ money from smoothing the takeover of the two banks as parliament’s financial delegation, which exercises independent authority in such matters, ratified the government bailout in the absence of MPs earlier this month. Swiss MPs are volunteers who only formally sit for twelve weeks a year.   But the latest vote, held at the end of a special two-day recall of parliament, will nevertheless constrain the Swiss government’s future room for manoeuvre in aiding UBS and is likely to lead to more onerous oversight of the bank on matters such as bonuses. Members of the Federal Council — Switzerland’s seven-person executive — implored parliamentarians to support the takeover package they had engineered in a fraught 72-hour period last month. The deal involves a SFr100bn ($111bn) liquidity lifeline from the Swiss National Bank and a SFr9bn government guarantee against losses incurred by UBS on the deal.  “Time was running out and the situation was deteriorating from hour to hour,” said Federal Council president Alain Berset in a speech to try and garner parliamentary support.  Credit Suisse’s collapse in March, on either Monday 20 or Tuesday 21, was a near certainty without government help, he said, “and would have caused an international financial crisis with devastating effects for our country”. Berset promised a rigorous review of banking legislation by the government and castigated “erratic management” at Credit Suisse who “destroyed” the bank over several years and “did not learn the lessons of the last financial crisis, or assume responsibility”.  Members of the National Council — the lower house — voted 103 against the Federal Council’s intervention on Wednesday afternoon in Bern, with 71 in favour and eight abstentions. An attempt by the Council of States, the upper house, to gain support for the government by appending a range of conditions to the approval, including measures on higher bank capital ratios and bonus restrictions, failed to shift lawmakers. National councillors from the country’s two biggest parties, the rightwing populist Swiss People’s party (SVP) and the leftwing Social Democratic party (SP) voted en masse against the bailout. Both parties have proposed tough new legislation. The SVP, which controls a quarter of the seats in the National Council, said on Wednesday it would table a law in the future to force the break-up of any bank that was deemed “too big to fail”.  The SP, which controls a fifth of seats, is similarly critical of support for oversized banks. The party has tabled motions to ban bonuses at “systematically relevant” banks and to subject them to stricter capital requirements.   “Worthy promises” about fewer bonuses and stricter capital requirements from bankers and sympathetic politicians can no longer be tolerated, said party co-president Mattea Meyer. “We will not turn a blind eye. We will do everything we can to finally free ourselves from being held hostage by the big banks and financial markets.”","12.04.2023"
"Swiss prosecutor opens probe into Credit Suisse takeover","Investigation will examine leaks and potential breaches of criminal law by officials, regulators and bank executives","Switzerland’s federal prosecutor has opened an investigation into the state-backed takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger rival UBS. The Bern-based prosecutor is looking into potential breaches of Swiss criminal law by government officials, regulators and executives at the two banks, which agreed an emergency merger last month over the course of a frantic weekend in order to avert a potentially catastrophic financial crisis. A focus of the probe concerns sensitive information from the negotiations that was leaked to the press, said a person familiar with the investigation, which could constitute a breach of state secrecy or industrial espionage laws.  “The federal prosecutor’s office wants to proactively fulfil its mission and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial centre and has set up monitoring in order to take immediate action in any situation that falls within its field of activity,” the authority told the Financial Times. There were “numerous aspects of events around Credit Suisse” that warranted investigation, it said, which needed to be analysed to “identify any crimes that could fall within the competence of the [prosecutor]”. The prosecutor, Stefan Blättler, has issued a number of “investigatory orders” to government bodies. His office has also been in contact with the federal and cantonal governments and is likely to seek to interview key officials in relation to the takeover. Swiss prosecutor Stefan Blättler has issued a number of ‘investigatory orders’ to government bodies © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images The forced marriage of the two banks has caused outcry in Switzerland; political parties have triggered a special sitting of parliament this month in which a formal commission of inquiry is likely to be voted into power. Polling shows that more than three-quarters of Swiss citizens are opposed to the $3.25bn takeover, which will create a financial behemoth with more than SFr5tn ($5.4tn) of assets under management. A majority support legislation to split up the bank or even measures to claw back bonuses from senior staff, who they say should be held responsible for their actions.  Parliamentarians from across the political spectrum have also questioned the use of emergency powers by the government — the seven-person Federal Council — to extend taxpayer-backed financial guarantees to UBS and to silence possible shareholder opposition. The Federal Council issued an ordinance to wipe out more than SFr16bn of additional tier 1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse in order to smooth the takeover, while choosing to preserve some value for equity holders.  The measure angered some large international fixed-income investors and caused concern among international regulators over its impact on other banks’ ability to raise capital.  Some of the investors affected have pledged to take the Swiss government and financial regulator to court over the decision. Bern has insisted the urgency of the situation last month left it with few options. Credit Suisse experienced a significant deterioration in its ability to access liquidity in the days before the rescue was finalised, on March 19, the government has said.  According to finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter, a state takeover of Credit Suisse, or its orderly break-up in a process known as “resolution” were not viable alternatives to the takeover owing to the unacceptable financial risks to taxpayers they would have incurred.   Shareholders for both UBS and Credit Suisse — who were denied a say by the government fiat — will next week have an opportunity to air grievances at both banks’ annual meetings. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment.","02.04.2023"

That was the message to investors today from Legal and General Investment Management, the UK’s largest asset manager, which said markets were failing to price in the risks of climate change. Delaying the shift to a low-carbon economy could leave global equities a third lower than in a rapid transition, it said, with a quarter of companies that currently issue investment-grade bonds facing downgrades if a net-zero world was not achieved by 2050. The warning is timely. It comes on the day the UN voted to clarify the legal obligations of countries to protect their populations from climate change and as the UK, labelled “strikingly unprepared” for global warming by a parliamentary committee, prepares a policy blitz around energy and net-zero goals. The UK climate change committee’s report, one in a series of critical assessments of the government’s performance, identified multiple failures, including slow progress in cutting water consumption and leakage and the lack of a clear strategy to protect agriculture. Much more needed to be done to build in resilience against weather extremes, on everything from homes to transport, communications and energy systems, the report stated.  The government’s “energy security day” tomorrow is expected to include news on subsidies for green aviation fuel made from household waste; funding details for a new body called Great British Nuclear; an easing of onshore wind development; tweaks to oil and gas windfall taxes; and changes to green levies on electricity bills and the way prices are set. There could also be more news on green finance such as encouraging the uptake of  “green gilts” — bonds that finance projects contributing to reducing emissions. The green transition is also preoccupying policymakers in Brussels.  France wants to treat nuclear energy as equivalent to renewables so it counts towards the EU’s target of producing 40 per cent of energy from such sources by 2030. Countries such as Germany and Austria, however, said this would undermine efforts to expand solar, wind and other renewable sources. Nuclear power plants generated about two-thirds of France’s electricity output in 2022.  Negotiations are also continuing on the EU’s response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, with agreement close on allowing European battery makers to access US subsidies. The IRA had stipulated that battery components  — cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese and nickel — must come from countries with a US free trade agreement, sparking fears that European companies could lose out. The US separately yesterday signed a battery deal with Japan to help reduce supply chain dependency on China.  Today’s resolution at the UN, passed by consensus without a vote, means the International Court of Justice, its top legal body, will assess the legal obligations of countries to protect their people from climate change.  The move, which could increase the risk of litigation for those failing to adhere to existing laws and treaties, was described as a “historic moment for international climate justice”. It follows a long campaign led by Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation at risk from rising sea levels.

"Beware of Greek lessons for AT1 bondholders","All creditors are always and everywhere junior to political expediency","There’s a growing sense that Switzerland probably didn’t have a rock-solid legal foundation to wipe out Credit Suisse’s $16bn of AT1s — at least on a narrow interpretation on the bond documentation clauses.  Not everyone agrees of course, but even the ECB, BoE EBA came out and pretty explicitly criticised it. That’s presumably why FINMA came out last week to stress that it also relied on an “emergency ordinance” passed by the Swiss government that weekend.  This is a classic kitchen-sink defence: On 19 March 2023, the Federal Council enacted the Emergency Ordinance on Additional Liquidity Assistance Loans and the Granting of Federal Default Guarantees for Liquidity Assistance Loans by the Swiss National Bank to Systemically Important Banks. The Ordinance also authorises FINMA to order the borrower and the financial group to write down Additional Tier 1 capital.Based on the contractual agreements and the Emergency Ordinance, FINMA instructed Credit Suisse to write down the AT1 bonds. For crisis connoisseurs of a certain generation, this is a delightful/unnerving (delete according to personal preference) echo of what Greece did to its own creditors a decade ago, and a timely reminder we are all subordinated to the sovereign.   Most of the time, the jurisdiction under which a bond is issued doesn’t matter much — until it really matters. And when it does, ignore what the contract says, you are always going to be junior to political expediency. That’s life.  Back in 2012 Greece launched what was euphemistically called “private sector involvement” but in reality constituted a brutal haircut on almost €200bn of government debt (it was a 53.5 per cent reduction in nominal terms and roughly 75 per cent in net present value terms, so more of a scalping than a haircut).  To make sure that the entire (domestic) debt stack was restructured without a hitch, the Greek parliament voted to retroactively insert “collective action clauses” into all local-law government debt. These clauses bind all bondholders to anything a supermajority agrees to, thereby neutering any difficult creditors that refuse to restructure and try hold out for a better deal later on. Now, as Allen & Overy’s Yannis Manuelides has written, this law change was theoretically done with the blessing of over half of Greece’s creditors, and the restructuring itself was voted on by over two-thirds of them.  In reality, most of them were European banks who had their arms heavily twisted by their respective governments. Various international law bonds worth €6.4bn were never restructured, and some aggrieved local-law creditors sued Greece over this legal ju-jitsu.  History doesn’t echo but it rhymes etc etc. Investors are once again on the warpath over a European government retroactively changing its laws to diddle creditors, with legal gunslingers-for-hire Quinn Emanuel leading a bondholder group that includes David Tepper of Appaloosa Management. Here’s what he told mainFT last week: “If this is left to stand, how can you trust any debt security issued in Switzerland, or for that matter wider Europe, if governments can just change laws after the fact . . . Contracts are made to be honoured.” The brutal truth is that the Greek situation shows that when it comes to local law bonds, the government can basically do whatever it wishes. As occasional FTAV bloggers and fulltime sovereign debt restructuring nerds Lee Buchheit and Mitu Gulati have called it, this is “the local law advantage” (Buchheit, as Greece’s lawyer, was actually the architect of that retroactive CAC move back in 2012).   Greece’s bondholders also sued through the local courts and internationally under a bilateral investment treaty. They even took their case all the way to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that their right to property had been violated.  They failed on all accounts, notes Manuelides: The BIT claim failed on jurisdictional/procedural grounds, the challenge before the Greek courts failed because of the ‘supreme public interest’ defence and the challenge before the ECHR failed because the court held, in addition to public interest reasons, that steps taken to resolve the collective action problem are ultimately beneficial because, overall, they better preserve property. In the Credit Suisse case, the AT1 wipeout technically happened through an executive order, rather than an act of parliament — a nuance that bondholders probably hope to exploit.  But if the Swiss Federal Assembly decide to ratify the emergency ordinance through formal legislation when it next meets it could even vote to pay creditors a bar of Toblerone and they’d still have limited chances of winning a legal case.  As Credit Suisse’s AT1 bond docs state plainly:  And further down in the T&Cs.  In theory there are limits to what a country can do within its borders, For example, there may be some constitutional checks, or myriad international treaties that set some ground rules.   In practice, being able to pass laws is the thermonuclear bomb of debt resolution, and both domestic and international courts are leery of circumscribing the power of a sovereign country. The only real constraint is that in some cases — such as with a country’s debt — being too draconian will do more harm than good because it could obliterate the domestic financial system.  Of course, this has major (albeit not new) implications for other junior bondholders around Europe, who really shouldn’t feel reassured by what officials at various central banks or governmental agencies might say about this being a uniquely Swiss thing Does anyone really think that reelection-seeking politicians will in a major crisis care about these statements about respecting creditor hierarchies etc if it is politically easier to stiff investors that have bought instruments explicitly designed to help recapitalise banks? If so FTAV has a (local law) Greek bond to sell them (or some commemorative merch).  That said, all the bleating about lawless, banana republic pariah state Switzerland should probably also be taken with a truckload of salt.  Over the centuries bond investors have always direly proclaimed that an issuer will be exiled from capital markets for generations if they dare to fiddle with a single coupon payment. In reality, memories are remarkably short.  Greece returned to the bond market just two years after its record-smashing debt restructuring, borrowing €3bn in 2014 at just 4.75 per cent thanks to a €20bn order book from mostly international investors. By 2021 it was able to borrow money for 30 years at below 2 per cent — and its shorter-term borrowing costs were negative. It therefore wouldn’t be surprising to see UBS 2.0 hit the AT1 market sooner than people might think.

"UBS and Julius Baer grapple with offering wealth advice in the metaverse","Banks have experimented with headsets and pixelated avatars to interact with clients","Two of the world’s biggest wealth managers are experimenting with switching client meetings from oak-panelled boardrooms to the metaverse, but have struggled to overcome data security and motion sickness. UBS and Julius Baer, Swiss banks that specialise in providing white-glove financial advice to billionaires, have each trialled the use of clunky headsets and pixelated avatars to interact with clients, according to people involved in the research.  But neither bank is close to rolling out a virtual reality offering to their ultra-rich customers after the experiments caused concern over the technology’s ease of use and the ability to share documents securely.  “The technology is not there yet — frankly it looks like Atari graphics at the moment and people who have tried it have had feelings of motion sickness,” said one bank executive involved in the trials. “We also have a lot of issues with confidential and sensitive data security.” The metaverse is an immersive virtual world where people wearing headsets interact with one another as three-dimensional avatars.  It has been championed by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, which was renamed as Meta last year and has provoked ire from investors for its heavy spending on virtual reality. Wealth management is one of the last professional services to be disrupted by digitisation as the ultra-rich value personal interaction with their advisers when discussing their investments.  But some wealth managers have begun investing heavily in technology in recent years to make sure they are prepared for changing demand.  Since becoming chief executive of UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager, two years ago, Ralph Hamers has prioritised investment in digital technology to cut costs and differentiate the group’s offering to rivals.  “We will use digitalisation and all the opportunities it brings to provide personal advice, and use digital technology to tailor that advice to clients’ needs,” Hamers told shareholders at the bank’s annual general meeting this year. “This is not a question of either/or: clients decide what they want, and our job is to deliver what they want.” Hamers had pursued the use of artificial intelligence in wealth management through a $1.4bn acquisition of US advisory business Wealthfront, but UBS aborted that takeover in September. A person involved in UBS’s trials of virtual reality said the bank was trying to find ways to improve the digital meetings it is already increasingly having with clients. “We have gone through some experiments,” they said. “We have set up virtual offices in the metaverse, we have tested how to engage with clients, different ways to play with it, how does it look, how does your avatar look, does it really help us.  “We’re not there — it’s still very much experimentation.”  UBS has previously trialled using augmented reality technology to enable staff to recreate a trading floor environment while working from home during the pandemic. Fellow Swiss bank Julius Baer has also committed to spending heavily on technology in the next few years and has experimented with virtual reality. The bank ran a 12-week pilot for a group of staff to hold internal meetings in virtual spaces, while 200 executives recently took part in a “metaverse experience” at a senior global management conference.  “There’s no outward facing use of this kind of tech at this stage, and it is really meant to build a knowledge and understanding of the space in order to be ready once the technology is in the right place and, importantly, once outstanding regulatory issues are addressed,” said a person with knowledge of the trials.","06.11.2022"

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter:   Tracking the Odey falloutInside Thoma Bravo’s big sale to NasdaqUS banks shut out of China listings High finance begins cutting ties to Crispin Odey  After making hundreds of millions of pounds betting on Brexit in 2016, Crispin Odey took to the BBC to boast about his accomplishments. “I still think tomorrow they’re gonna take it all away from me,” he said with a laugh.  The risk-hungry investor was used to wild swings in his portfolio. But his latest troubles will be hard to recover from. The hedge fund titan has left his eponymous firm following an FT investigation by Madison Marriage, Antonia Cundy and Paul Caruana Galizia in which 13 women accused him of sexual assault or harassment in various incidents over a 25-year period.  Crispin Odey arrives at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in September 2020  © Reuters  Odey confirmed to the FT that he had been notified of the firm’s decision but suggested he would fight it. “You have to have [a] willing buyer, willing seller,” he said, declining to comment further. He also stated last week that “none of the allegations have been stood up in a courtroom or an investigation”, while his lawyers have previously stated that allegations made against him were “strenuously disputed”.  Nonetheless, Odey’s ties to some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions have begun to unravel. The move to eject Odey from his own fund came after Morgan Stanley, one of OAM’s prime brokers, moved to cut ties with the firm last week.  Goldman Sachs has also begun unwinding its relationship with the firm, according to people familiar with the situation. JPMorgan Chase is reviewing its own ties. BNP Paribas-owned Exane told OAM it was terminating the relationship on Thursday night, according to people with knowledge of the development, while UK-based Schroders has parted ways with OAM by selling investments run by the fund manager. The fallout has led EU funds managed by OAM to discuss restrictions on investors’ withdrawals as part of emergency measures to contain the damage, the FT reported on Monday. MPs also plan to grill the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority over its handling of the allegations. The revelations from the FT’s investigation prompted the FCA to broaden an existing investigation into the firm. It’s a swift reversal in Odey’s reception on Wall Street and in the City of London, where murmurs of his alleged sexual misconduct remained just a footnote on his more than three decades on London’s hedge fund scene. Now, though, it seems he’s in for a reckoning. The dealmaker behind Thoma Bravo’s big windfall The world’s largest trading venues such as Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange are turning to private equity to become broader financial technology businesses, minting enormous windfalls for Wall Street.  On Monday, US exchange group Nasdaq struck its largest-ever acquisition, buying Adenza, a risk management and compliance software business, from buyouts group Thoma Bravo for $10.5bn. Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman orchestrated the deal by reaching out to Thoma. She has transformed the exchange into a major technology vendor to large banks. Less than a quarter of Nasdaq’s revenues will now come from trading fees. For Holden Spaht, the lead Thoma partner on Adenza, it was his second 11-figure sale of a financial software company to a large exchange group. Spaht led Thoma’s 2018 takeover of mortgage software specialist Ellie Mae for $3.7bn. Eighteen months later, Thoma sold the business to Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, for over $11bn. Thoma has invested tens of billions in software buyouts in recent years, causing some to question the prices it has paid. Monday’s sale signals some bets are paying off. Thoma’s Fund XIII and its $22.8 Fund XIV — raised in 2020 — own Adenza, a source told DD. Thoma built the investment by purchasing compliance software company AxiomSL for a reported $2bn in 2020. A year later, it used AxiomSL to buy Calypso, a seller of risk management software for the derivatives market, for $3.7bn. To finance the tie-up Thoma raised more than $2bn in private financing from a group of 13 lenders led by Owl Rock that included its own credit arm. Other buyout firms have received windfalls from large exchanges. In 2019, Blackstone sold Refinitiv, the financial data business it carved out of Thomson Reuters, to LSE Group, the parent company of the London Stock Exchange, for $27bn in stock. It turned Refinitiv into one of Blackstone’s best-ever investments. Thoma is hoping for a similar outcome. It will receive $5.75bn in cash and a 15 per cent stake in Nasdaq worth about $5bn. While Thoma has a positive view on the exchange’s prospects, Nasdaq plunged 11.8 per cent signalling investor unease with the 35-times cash flow multiple it is paying. Bravo to Spaht, but for Thoma to win big, stockholders will eventually have to like the deal. China listings: US bankers wonder, why bother?  We wrote last month about how some of the biggest banks on Wall Street and in Europe have spent years pouring resources into setting up investment banking operations in mainland China, to little avail.  Perhaps the most visible example of their difficulty comes in the form of their tiny — and falling — share of roles on Chinese listings.  That has now fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade. This year, foreign banks have been involved in just 1.2 per cent of new listings by value, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Thomas Hale and Hudson Lockett report.  And not a single US bank has been involved in any of the 109 initial public offerings on China’s stock market this year, even though $26bn has been raised in that time. Worsening relations between the US and China are certainly part of the problem, making it harder for Chinese companies to justify bringing in American advisers.  There’s also a due diligence issue: several executives at global banks said it was hard to carry out the checks required.  Some senior bankers in Asia are now starting to wonder why they bother. “I’m amazed that there’s [billions of dollars’ worth] of issuance for IPOs in Shanghai every week, and the banks underwriting them are almost exclusively domestic,” said one executive from a US bank.  “Something needs to happen — the big banks either need to be involved in these deals, or we should leave the business and stop having resources allocated to it.” Job moves Illumina chief executive Francis deSouza has resigned following a bruising proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn over the gene sequencing group’s future.Five Credit Suisse senior executives departed hours after its takeover by rival UBS.Francesco De Ferrari, who had run Credit Suisse’s wealth management arm, will become a senior adviser to UBS wealth head Iqbal Khan.Goldman Sachs’ new consumer lending boss Stephanie Cohen is taking leave to focus on her family, Bloomberg reports. Barclays is struggling to stem an exodus from its investment bank including managing directors Michael Gingue and Sam Jackson, who are moving to Jefferies, and Derek Keller, who is joining UBS, people familiar with the matter told the FT.Andreessen Horowitz has opened its first international office in London.  Smart reads Surprise successor After taking the reins from his father, Alex Soros is using his unexpected ascent through his family’s $25bn foundation to back even more left-leaning politics, The Wall Street Journal reports.

"Julius Baer chief warns Switzerland not to jeopardise status as banker to super-rich","Philipp Rickenbacher says crisis of confidence in global banking far from over","Switzerland’s status as the world’s banker to the super-rich is not “god given”, the head of one of the country’s biggest banks has warned, as the country reels from the near-collapse of Credit Suisse. The Swiss government and regulators needed to better communicate with worried international investors, Julius Baer’s chief executive Philipp Rickenbacher told the Financial Times, as he cautioned that the crisis of confidence in global banking was far from over. “Things will remain very complicated — everything that was there a month ago will not go away,” Rickenbacher said, pointing to central banks’ rapid tightening of monetary policy and the stress it was putting the financial system under. “There’s still some room for policy mistakes at the highest levels when it comes to interest rates . . . everyone’s senses are sharpened right now.”  Switzerland, historically famed for the stability of its banks, has found itself on the front line of the current turmoil.  Two weeks ago, Swiss authorities were forced to orchestrate the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger rival UBS, granting huge government guarantees in order to prevent a catastrophic banking collapse, in a deal that shocked the banking world.  Julius Baer, which manages assets of about SFr424bn ($462bn) for wealthy individuals, is poised to become Switzerland’s second-largest bank as a result of the merger. Julius Baer’s chief Philipp Rickenbacher: ‘Things will remain very complicated — everything that was there a month ago will not go away’ © Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters Rickenbacher said the Swiss financial marketplace was an “outstanding ecosystem” but was being tested. “It is obvious that Swiss banks being in the international press is adding to this pressure and we as Swiss bankers have to respond.” He said he was seeing a “movement of clients to quality” in Switzerland as wealthy account holders pull back from UBS and Credit Suisse — whose business models also entail riskier investment banking activities — and shift towards traditional, more conservative Swiss banks. The 133-year-old Julius Baer is Switzerland’s largest “pure-play” private bank: it caters only to the account and investment needs of wealthy individuals and does not speculate with its own capital or run its own in-house asset management business.  It has not been without controversy of its own in the past. The Swiss market regulator, Finma, strongly censured the bank in 2020, imposing a strict monitoring regime, over findings that it had failed to live up to anti-money laundering standards for almost a decade. The bank has also paid hundreds of millions of dollars in regulatory fines to US authorities over the past 15 years. Equity markets now view it as a potential beneficiary of UBS and Credit Suisse’s arranged marriage: its share price has risen more than 12.3 per cent since the rescue, though it is up only 11.7 per cent year to date.  “Our model . . . has worked very well for us, let’s put it that way,” said Rickenbacher. He said the bank was also having “constructive discussions” with staff at Credit Suisse who were already looking to leave their troubled employer. “We have hiring opportunities in Latin America, we have hiring opportunities in Asia — and also in HK, now it is back online — and by the way we also have hiring opportunities in Europe and in Switzerland,” he said. A crucial concern for management at UBS is how to stop departing staff taking lucrative clients with them. Many rich account holders are already worried about UBS’s takeover of its more freewheeling rival, wealth advisers and banking analysts have said. The combined bank will have assets under management of more than $5tn.* “An integration of that order of magnitude in Switzerland is going to take a lot of resources and effort, and a lot of complexity,” said Rickenbacher, who was careful to also praise the quality of his rivals’ businesses and leadership.  The rescue deal has, all the same, raised questions over moral hazard, he believes, calling for a review of the global regulatory standards set in place after the 2008 financial crisis.  “‘Too big to fail’ [regulations] were designed to solve one problem . . . and in this case they could not solve that problem,” he said. “[My] gut feeling and moral compass says that a private institution should be able to fail, and that is a good starting point.”  Julius Baer was extremely conscious of its risks and managed its balance sheet extremely cautiously, he said. “I would say very humbly that we are not too big to fail.”  *This article has been updated to say that UBS and Credit Suisse combined will have assets under management of more than $5tn, rather than a balance sheet of more than $5tn ","03.04.2023"
"Boomerang chief executives provide comfort in times of crisis","The hope is former leaders can bring stability, yet data suggests companies that bring them back underperform","When a crisis hits, corporate boards can find comfort in familiarity. Swiss bank UBS did just that this week, announcing Sergio Ermotti would return as chief executive to steer the difficult integration of domestic rival Credit Suisse. Several other “boomerang” chief executives have taken back their roles. Last November Bob Iger was reappointed to the top job at Disney after a loss of confidence in successor Bob Chapek’s leadership. Starbucks founder Howard Schultz returned to the coffee chain for his third stint as chief executive in April 2022 after his replacement, Kevin Johnson, retired.  Largely a US phenomenon, the hope is that these individuals — who know the business and understand its corporate culture — can bring stability at a time of chaos. They are a known entity to the board, top executives and shareholders, paving the way for a seamless turnround. Activist investor Carl Icahn this week called on US biotech Illumina to bring back its former boss Jay Flatley — his latest move in a brewing proxy fight with the company.   “I spoke to a number of big shareholders in Illumina and most of them like him and say he did a great job in the past. And we need someone who can do a great job right now,” Icahn told the Financial Times. “When you have problems it is very hard to find somebody to lead a company, which is why you often look back to see who did it well in the past.” One senior leader at UBS said the acquisition of Credit Suisse was the most significant banking combination since the financial crisis, presenting huge uncertainty. “This is a major, major deal with enormous complexity and the board wanted to take no risk on execution. It is as simple as that. Sergio is the right man for the deal. He knows both parties well. He has the experience.” Howard Schultz during his first stint as chief executive of Starbucks. After leaving in 2000, he returned twice to head the coffee chain © Koji Sasahara/AP Ermotti, who ran UBS for nine years before handing the reins to Ralph Hamers in 2020, had in his previous stint drawn up plans to acquire Credit Suisse several times, according to people familiar with his thinking. Research by headhunter Spencer Stuart found that 22 chief executives of companies in the S&P 500 had returned to their previously held posts in the past 12 years. Of these, 13 came back permanently and nine were appointed on an interim basis, with most staying less than a year.   But data suggests companies typically underperform the market when they bring back former leaders.Chris Bingham, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina, said these individuals tended to “hurt rather than help” organisations.  He conducted research published in the MIT Sloan Management Review in 2020 assessing the performance of “boomerang” chiefs. Using a sample of 6,429 chief executive tenures at companies in the S&P Composite 1500, from 1992 to 2017, Bingham and his co-authors found that stock performance was 10 per cent lower at the 167 groups led by reappointed leaders than at their counterparts. This was particularly true if the returning chief executive was one of the company’s original founders.  “Boards want someone who can hit the ground running. They often don’t have a lot of time and there is a crisis. This is often the logic. Why shake things up, this is someone that has dealt with crises in the past and can deal with the current ones. This is especially helpful for investors who are looking for reassurance. This is what is happening at UBS,” said Bingham.But he issued a warning: the reason why boomerang chief executives did not perform as well was partly because they were returning to a starkly different business environment.  “For UBS’s Ermotti — it has only been two years, but look at how much things can change”, he added. From managing the fallout from Covid, to having policies on flexible working, diversity and inclusion, the role of the post-pandemic chief executive has evolved. When you have problems it is hard to find somebody to lead a company, which is why you often look back to see who did it well in the past.Activist investor Carl Icahn Still, the idea of bringing back a successful chief executive is alluring when a company is in trouble. Steve Jobs’ reappointment at Apple is often cited as a game-changer for the tech group. After being removed from his position as chief executive in 1985, he returned when Apple was close to collapse in 1996, refocusing and rebuilding it into the tech titan it is today.   Other high-profile examples include Michael Dell, who left his namesake company only to return to lead it three years later in 2007, as well as former bosses at Twitter, Best Buy, Bloomberg and Charles Schwab.  In another recent example, Katrina Lake, founder of Stitch Fix, the online personal shopping subscription service, returned to the role of chief executive in January, less than two years after stepping aside.  Some executive search professionals believe bringing back a former chief executive says more about the board failing to ensure a smooth succession process than about the stellar performance of a past leader. “Each company has their own story. The Ermotti story is a little different from the Iger story, for example. But in general, if I was to see a pattern, it is that you have a strong, longstanding respected leader leaving big shoes to fill and the successor then deemed not able to do it,” said one headhunter of top boardroom roles. “More often than not these are highly alpha CEOs who are not interested in creating successors and can be seen sniping from the sidelines and undermining their replacement,” he added. “When a successor fails, the board often thinks ‘let’s bring back the former CEO’, but they probably should think, ‘shouldn’t we bring in someone else’”.  ","31.03.2023"
"ISDA* happening!","The determinations committee has been summoned ","While plebs wonder if UBS is now too big, and rubes muse whether global banks can ever really be smoothly wound down, the crediterati have been speculating whether Credit Suisse actually defaulted in its forced merger with its Swiss rival. And now it looks like we might find out. A Bloomberg news spike alert made Alphaville scurry over to the website of the International Swap and Derivatives Association Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee, and, lo:  This week, someone finally asked the determinations committees — a group of up to 10 representatives from banks and five from investment groups that decides whether credit-default swaps pay out — whether CS defaulted.   *Here we should note that ISDA, which originally set up the DC system back in 2009 and acted as its secretary, in 2018 transferred the admin work to an ISDA subsidiary called DC Administration Services is that is nominally independent. ISDA’s docs still set the standard for credit derivatives.  Longtime Alphavillain readers will recall Lisa Pollack’s oeuvre on the machinations and ruminations of the DCs, which operate not dissimilarly to a papal conclave choosing a new pope and announcing the decision with white or black smoke.  Now, we still don’t know if the DC will decide to even hear the case (this is just flagging that someone has asked it to make a ruling), but we suspect that it will have to.  There was about $20bn of CDS on CS debt at the time of its collapse, and, as Risk reported at the time, it wasn’t “crystal clear” whether the AT1 bond vaporisation would trigger CDS payouts. But it seems some hedge funds have grown confident that it will.  From Bloomberg yesterday: An illiquid corner of swaps insuring Credit Suisse Group AG debt surged back to life this week as some hedge funds make the case they should be triggered. Funds including FourSixThree Capital and Diameter Capital Partners have been buying swaps insuring Credit Suisse’s subordinated bonds with the idea that the controversial writedown of the firm’s AT1 securities could prompt a potential payout of the derivative contracts, according to people familiar with the matter.While the five-year credit default swaps dipped on Thursday, they’re up more than 80 basis points this week to about 360, according to CMAI prices. That’s the biggest increase since UBS Group AG agreed to buy Credit Suisse in an emergency weekend deal in March. As part of that acquisition, Swiss regulators forced the wipeout of about $17 billion of so-called Additional Tier 1 notes. 🍿","11.05.2023"
"German police raid UBS over Usmanov money laundering probe","Russian businessman rejects allegations as bank’s Frankfurt and Munich branches are searched","German police have raided offices of the Swiss bank UBS in connection with a money laundering investigation into Uzbek-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov.  UBS branches in Frankfurt and Munich were searched on Tuesday morning, state prosecutors confirmed to the Financial Times.  “The subject of the investigation is the initial suspicion of money laundering against a businessman from the Russian Federation. The investigations are not aimed at the bank concerned or its employees,” the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office said.   Speaking on condition of anonymity, German officials said that Usmanov was the individual targeted by Tuesday’s raids, which were first reported by Der Spiegel.  Usmanov, 69, is one of the world’s wealthiest men, with an estimated fortune of more than $19.5bn, earned through a business empire with holdings in some of Russia’s largest mining, industrial and telecoms companies.  As well as being the owner of the biggest superyacht ever built, the $600mn Dilbar, his assets include stakes in English Premier League football clubs Arsenal and Everton. He was a former top shareholder in Apple, Facebook and Twitter.  After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February, Usmanov was one of the first Russian businessmen to be hit by western sanctions, thanks to his close ties to the Kremlin.  The EU described him as “one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs”. Usmanov has launched legal cases in Europe to challenge the measures against him. Those attempts have so far been unsuccessful, though the EU did lift sanctions against one of his sisters in September.  “We categorically reject any allegations of money laundering or tax evasion on the part of Alisher Usmanov,” a spokesperson for Usmanov said on Tuesday.   “These claims are unfounded, false and slanderous to his honour and reputation. Mr Usmanov is an honest and law-abiding taxpayer, who has paid all due taxes in Russia. He is also recognised as one of the most generous philanthropists in the world.” UBS did not respond to a request for comment. The searches at the bank’s Frankfurt and Munich premises follow two raids in September — involving more than 250 police — at properties owned by Usmanov in Bavaria.  Prosecutors at the time said they were part of an investigation into the use of complex offshore holding companies to disguise illicit financial flows worth millions of euros.  Usmanov’s European and US assets have been frozen since the beginning of the war as a result of sanctions against him. In March, the 156-metre-long Dilbar was seized by German authorities in Hamburg, where it was undergoing refurbishment.  For months Usmanov has been in the sights of a special task force set up by the German government to probe the legality of assets of Russian oligarchs in the country and trigger police interventions where possible.  Usmanov also owns properties in the UK, including the £48mn Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate, and Sutton Place, the Tudor mansion in Surrey formerly owned by billionaire industrialist J Paul Getty.

"Switzerland bans deferred bonuses for Credit Suisse staff","Finance ministry halts awards as demoralised bankers say ‘we thought it couldn’t get any worse’","The Swiss government has banned Credit Suisse from paying deferred bonuses awarded before 2022 in a move that sparked more upset from staff at the failed bank. The federal finance ministry said on Tuesday it had imposed “remuneration-related measures” on Credit Suisse as a result of the use of taxpayer funds to facilitate its $3.25bn takeover by rival UBS. “More happy news,” said one Credit Suisse banker. “Maybe UBS will turn up to find they have bought empty offices . . . Our shares are near worthless.”  Credit Suisse management had tried to avoid a mass walkout of staff by promising to maintain planned pay awards. “We will pay salary and bonus, where outstanding, as per the previously communicated schedule,” the bank said in an internal email on Sunday night. But the federal council, Switzerland’s executive body, has ordered Credit Suisse not to pay awards from previous years, while allowing the bank to pay bonuses awarded for 2022 for the sake of “legal certainty” and to “avoid impacting employees who did not themselves cause the crisis”. The federal council has also asked the finance ministry to draw up plans to control payouts to Credit Suisse staff for all future bonus rewards. Public anger over banker bonuses has remained high in Switzerland since the financial crisis. Protests erupted in Zurich on Monday in front of Credit Suisse’s headquarters over the proposed use of public money in the rescue deal. Bern has written a SFr9bn guarantee to UBS to support its digestion of its rival and authorised a SFr100bn liquidity support facility from the Swiss National Bank.  Swiss political parties from across the spectrum have been in uproar over the bailout. The largest, the rightwing populist Swiss People’s party, said Credit Suisse bankers have “taken millions in pay without taking responsibility”. The country’s second-largest party, the Social Democrats, have pledged legislation for a ban on all bonus payments and a salary cap at all large banks receiving state help.   A second Credit Suisse banker said: “We thought it couldn’t get any worse and it just did. Essentially, this seems like the government is helping UBS unwind the investment bank but cutting everybody’s pay.” A third said: “We are not entirely clear what will happen next but morale is so down it’s hard to even describe.” The finance ministry declined to comment on whether clawback measures were also under consideration. Credit Suisse paid out SFr972mn to its bankers last year as part of rewards deferred from previous years. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the government intervention.  According to the company’s annual report, released last week, at the end of 2021, Credit Suisse bankers were owed SFr2.793bn ($3bn) in deferred compensation, based on the bank’s then share price. At the end of 2022, SFr1.25bn in deferred compensation awards was owed. Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","21.03.2023"
"Ulrich Körner, the man trying to hold Credit Suisse together","The introverted petrolhead is tasked with stabilising the troubled investment bank","In another life, Ulrich Körner would be best known for trying to save a different Swiss bank from collapse. In September 2011, UBS was in disarray after rogue trader Kweku Adoboli lost $2.3bn and chief executive Oswald Grübel was forced to resign. As the board scrambled to find a replacement, early press release drafts had a place holder for the new CEO’s name: “UK”. But Körner, then chief operating officer and deputy CEO, refused to take an interim role — he wanted the bank’s full backing. The board demurred and the draft was swiftly updated with new initials: “SPE”. Sergio Pietro Ermotti seized his chance and ran the lender for a largely successful decade. Eleven years later, the reserved Körner has another chance to stabilise a national institution facing an existential crisis: this time UBS’s fierce rival Credit Suisse. It has been a rocky start. During his eight-month tenure, the shares have plunged 63 per cent as the bank reported a second consecutive multibillion loss and panicked customers withdrew SFr111bn ($121bn) of funds.  Credit Suisse hit a nadir this week when its largest investor ruled out providing any more capital, which turbocharged market contagion from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Its debt slid to distressed prices and it was forced to petition the Swiss National Bank for a SFr50bn lifeline. But even a backstop from their fabled bullion stockpiles failed to stem the bleeding. Speculation swirls about bankruptcy, break-up or a state-arranged rescue by UBS. “Status quo is no longer an option,” says JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein. Is Körner — described by one colleague as “unflappable, despite having the most stressful job in banking” and by another as “having a preternatural ability to absorb pressure” — the right man to hold the bank together? “Uli may come across as an introverted person, but he’s very likeable one on one, smart and intelligent, and in many cases those are the best people in a crisis,” says Ermotti, former chief executive of UBS. “But at the time he took the job, it was like a firefighter being asked to rush into a burning building. It is extremely challenging and difficult to turn this around.” Körner, 60, was born in Germany but went to a Swiss school and holds dual citizenship. He started his career at Price Waterhouse before joining McKinsey. In 1998, he joined Credit Suisse, rising to become head of Switzerland. “He was a very quiet individual, kept his counsel to himself,” says Kai Nargowala, who left the Credit Suisse board last year. “At the time the place was dominated by Americans like [former CEO] Brady Dougan and [former asset management boss] Eric Varvel, and as you know Americans like to take up a lot of the oxygen in the room. Uli was silent but effective.” In 2009 Körner went to UBS. Ermotti tasked him with slashing a bloated corporate centre and turning around the asset management unit, and credits him with “a fantastic job”. It was there he earned the nickname “Uli the knife” for his dispassionate cost cutting.  Körner returned to Credit Suisse in April 2021 to help redress the Greensill Capital scandal, when the asset management unit was forced to suspend $10bn of investment funds amid allegations of fraud. At the same time, the crisis deepened when the bank lost $5.5bn on the collapse of family office Archegos. Credit Suisse had gone into “analysis paralysis, it couldn’t make a decision on anything”, says Nargowala. “At this stage it needs some clear direction, and Uli has tried to give that.” Choosing Körner was an attempt to break a pattern of more flamboyant leaders whose terms had ended in disgrace, according to one board member. “Uli is not a showman, but a very fact-based and sober business leader,” the board member says. “Journalists may find him less exciting. But that is what we need.” However, his blunt, data-led communication style has failed to comfort investors. Nor has he managed to halt the client exodus from the wealth management division, key to Credit Suisse’s ability to survive. “Uli keeps repeating that [the bank] has high liquidity and capital so is safe and sound, but that should be a given, it is not reassuring,” says one rival Swiss banking executive. “The bland style and the pace that things are being done is a concern.” Former top investor David Herro, of Harris Associates, has also criticised a deal Körner approved with a board member. Michael Klein orchestrated a spinout of the investment banking business, negotiating not only a $175mn buyout of his own firm, but also a $10mn fee for his advice. “He has never run an investment bank so is at the mercy of people like Klein, who are running rings around him,” one senior colleague says. “Likewise, he has never run wealth management nor worked outside Switzerland, so doesn’t have the network to fact check and navigate these global strategic decisions.”  Outside work, Körner’s personality is more colourful. He has three children — and three dogs: a dogo argentino, Boston terrier and German wire-haired pointer — and lives in Engadine, an Alpine valley where he hikes and skis. He is also sociable and likes a drink, favouring wine. But he is best known in Zurich for being a “petrolhead” and rally driver. He takes a different classic Porsche from his collection to the office each day. In 2013 he raced in the “Peking to Paris Motor Challenge” in a customised grey 1972 Porsche 911 and he negotiated the UBS sponsorship of Formula 1, claiming to colleagues that he got the better of Bernie Ecclestone. Since taking over in July, he has told friends that he is too busy to race. However, if he is unable to rally Credit Suisse’s shares soon, he may find himself with more time to indulge his passion.

"Credit Suisse AT1s: investors go loco after Coco no-no","Current rout raises awkward questions about how useful these instruments are as capital buffers","Bond investors woke up with a big problem on Monday. Sunday’s emergency takeover of struggling Swiss bank Credit Suisse by its rival UBS deepened a rout in AT1 bonds. These instruments are designed to be wiped out when an issuing bank hits financial trouble, reducing its debts. Swiss regulators obliterated about $17bn of Credit Suisse AT1s on Sunday, as local rules evidently allow. That triggered drops in other European and Asian AT1s, which had begun falling heavily last week. AT1s, which are sometimes classed as contingent convertibles or “Cocos”, are senior to equity but junior to other debt instruments in the capital stack. Coupons are correspondingly higher.   Owners of Credit Suisse bonds are furious because UBS will pay equity investors $3bn for their shares in UBS stock. This is a fraction of Credit Suisse’s recent market worth, but a payout nevertheless. But because Credit Suisse was taken over, rather than filed for bankruptcy, these arguments may not hold up in court. Triggers for voiding AT1 bonds differ by country and according to individual terms.  The European Central Bank and other EU regulators pointed this out in a statement that criticised the Swiss authorities and attempted to calm investors. Their confidence in this $275bn market has taken a blow, even so. The perpetual notes of important lenders in Asia, including Hong Kong’s Bank of East Asia and Thailand’s Kasikornbank, fell to about 80 cents to the dollar, levels rarely seen for these banks.  Prices for European AT1s were lower in some cases. On Monday morning, instruments issued by UBS were at 84 cents but Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas were at about 70 cents on the dollar.  AT1s were initially seized on by Asian hedge funds, who saw them as offering high returns at low risk. But the yields — for many banks almost double that of senior debt — have attracted more funds from institutional and retail investors in Asia in recent years.  The impact of the AT1 rout will be biggest in Europe. European issuers account for more than 80 per cent of the total market. Almost all of them are lenders, the rest are insurance companies.  AT1s have helped them fulfil regulatory capital requirements. But the current rout raises awkward questions about how useful they are as capital buffers. If national financial authorities can wipe them out before equity, investors will have to price AT1s accordingly. They would then trade on yields that would be prohibitively high for issuers. One obvious conclusion would be that investors who read AT1 small print carefully should find some bargains. But a problem remains: financial authorities may override contractual small print in future, even if Swiss watchdogs did not do so in this case.

"Credit Suisse files London High Court claim against SoftBank in $440mn dispute","Legal action marks escalation in Swiss bank’s efforts to recover funds linked to collapse of Greensill Capital","Credit Suisse is suing SoftBank in London’s High Court as the bank steps up the pursuit of $440mn it claims that its wealthiest clients are owed following the collapse of specialist finance firm Greensill Capital. The formal launch of proceedings in London is the first legal action by Credit Suisse since the bank was taken over by rival UBS in a rescue deal orchestrated by the Swiss government last month. Clients of Credit Suisse were left with hundreds of millions of dollars of losses after investing in a suite of supply-chain finance funds tied to Greensill that the Swiss bank marketed as low risk.   The losses were among the most damaging scandals to have hit Credit Suisse in recent years and contributed to the unease that infected the bank’s investors, clients and counterparties and hastened its demise. Credit Suisse served its claim against SoftBank in the High Court last week, according to people familiar with the matter. In a statement, SoftBank said that “after more than two years of attempting to shift blame for its own poor investment decisions, Credit Suisse has finally made a claim — but, as expected, it is entirely without merit and will be defended vigorously”.  The lawsuit centres on $440mn owed to the Swiss bank’s customers by Katerra, a Californian construction company funded by SoftBank’s Vision Fund and also a client of Greensill. Katerra had received the money via the bank’s supply chain finance funds.  Late in 2020, SoftBank agreed an emergency cash injection into Greensill, which was intended to cover the debts at Katerra. The Financial Times has previously reported that the money never reached the Credit Suisse funds.  In separate legal action in the US, Credit Suisse has alleged SoftBank masterminded a financial restructuring of Katerra that benefited the Japanese group at the expense of the Swiss bank’s clients.  Credit Suisse declined on Wednesday to comment on the legal action in the High Court but said it continued “to prioritise maximising recovery for investors in the supply chain finance funds”. The High Court action against SoftBank is one of several unresolved legal cases in which Credit Suisse is embroiled. Analysts have estimated the bank could face up to $5bn of litigation charges over the next four years. UBS has tried to protect itself by negotiating a loss guarantee of up to SFr9bn ($10bn) from the Swiss government as part of its takeover of Credit Suisse. The High Court claim marks an escalation in the bank’s legal fight after the company asked judges in California and Arizona in 2021 to compel Katerra to hand over documents relating to an agreement it struck with SoftBank in 2020. The bank also sought information on what SoftBank executives, including chair and chief executive Masayoshi Son, knew about the deal to bail out Katerra. Credit Suisse has recouped $7.4bn of the $10bn that clients invested in the Greensill funds, but attempts to pursue the rest are expected to take several years of court cases and legal claims.  Credit Suisse is represented by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in the case, while SoftBank has employed Quinn Emanuel. The latter is also preparing a lawsuit on behalf of Credit Suisse bondholders who will be wiped out as part of the bank’s rescue by UBS.","19.04.2023"
"Credit Suisse’s demise: a new twist on the ‘Swiss finish’","The bank’s fall has profoundly damaged Switzerland’s reputation in investment banking, wealth management and regulation","A “Swiss finish” was traditionally the description given to the extra layer of financial safeguards demanded by Switzerland’s bank regulators — reflective of the high quality the country has traditionally been famed for, from its watches to its banking sector. The demise of Credit Suisse has lent the term an unfortunate new meaning. But the fateful irony may not end there. The way CS failed, the mechanics of its shotgun rescue by arch rival UBS and the hangover implications for “Finanzplatz Schweiz” — the Swiss financial centre as a whole — are profound. Much of the blame for Credit Suisse’s problems must clearly be levelled at the bank itself — its aggressive culture, poor risk management and fudged decision-making. But the very regulatory system that was supposed to give the banks a halo of virtuous strength was, it turns out, another part of the problem. In 2019, a trio of academics from Yale School of Management and the Deutsche Bundesbank questioned the unusually important role in the country of so-called contingent capital instruments, which suffer writedowns in value or convert to equity in times of stress to absorb losses. The academics said the extent of the use of AT1 bonds, one form of contingent capital, in the banks’ regulatory capital structure “may call into question the extent to which the Swiss Finish to [global rules] represents a meaningful enhancement to the [global] framework”.  Finma, the prudential regulator, has been criticised for failing to police Credit Suisse’s financial strength adequately. And Finma, along with the Swiss government, is now in the crosshairs of US investors, who have accused Switzerland of acting like a “banana republic” over the decision to upend the usual investor hierarchy and wipe out AT1 bondholders, while preserving some equity value. The whole point of contingent capital — to help stabilise a failing institution in a predictable way — has been thrown into doubt. This all matters because Switzerland’s banking system is vast. Its total assets are equivalent to 520 per cent of the country’s GDP, a far higher proportion than any other major developed country.  The past 15 years have been tough for Swiss banking. UBS, today the rescuer of CS, was itself on its knees back in the 2008 financial crisis. Soon afterwards US tax authorities went after Swiss banks for facilitating the evasion of taxes by US citizens and by 2018 the country’s long-standing bank secrecy rules had been stripped away. Though some Swiss bankers are pleased, saying it clears away a whiff of potential criminal association, it has also removed a draw for some clients. Then began the drip-drip of scandal at CS, culminating in this month’s collapse. At least half a dozen further injuries will be inflicted on the Swiss financial centre as a result.  At the most obvious level, the episode has profoundly damaged Switzerland’s reputation in investment banking, wealth management and regulation. The way in which the authorities used an emergency ordinance to write down the value of AT1 bonds to zero without even a parliamentary vote as yet undermined Switzerland’s long-standing reputation for a solid and predictable rule of law. Further issuance of such debt will be extremely difficult for some time and key investors, particularly wealthy Asians, many of them Swiss bank clients, have lost a lot of money — and faith in their banks. Shareholders too have been all but wiped out, damaging another wealth management client group, this time in the Middle East, where shareholders have lost billions of Swiss francs. The net result is that UBS alone will now account for two and half times the GDP of Switzerland, an even more challenging “too-big-to-fail” risk for the country. Domestically there is the related risk for retail banking thanks to a competition waiver on the deal. JPMorgan estimates the combined bank will have around 30 per cent of the market.   Switzerland, of course, remains an appealing place, with a highly skilled workforce, deeply embedded democracy and a sophisticated financial system. And New York and London bounced back from their banking failures. The country also might end up having a stronger national champion in the bulked up UBS. But it is clear Switzerland should have recognised the scale of problems of Credit Suisse earlier and tackled them harder. The Credit Suisse shock is a reminder to the world of the fragility of confidence in banking — even after post-crisis reforms.

"SNB/Credit Suisse: Swiss central bank hints at higher capital requirements","Report suggests Finma could have done more, earlier","Films directed by Sam Peckinpah and his disciples featured slow-motion violence. A report by the Swiss National Bank alludes to a similar effect prior to Credit Suisse’s catastrophic collapse. There was plenty of time to see what market forces would do to the vulnerable Swiss wealth manager. One clear lesson from the SNB report: current capital buffers are inadequate.  The SNB does not regulate Swiss banks. Finma does. This report suggests the watchdog could have done more, earlier. Credit Suisse’s low price-to-book ratio and poor return on assets clearly indicated imminent threats to the bank. This puts investors in a quandary. Common equity tier one ratios well above regulatory minimums — Credit Suisse had a reasonably high 14 per cent at end March — mean little when confidence evaporates. The credibility of capital and liquidity measures depends on highly prudent asset valuations.   Credit Suisse had a serious market credibility problem, after years of mismanagement. Its “difficult-to-assess” assets, as the SNB put it, threatened more losses eroding its capital base further. No one, at Credit Suisse nor Finma, took tough enough decisions early enough. In 2021, Credit Suisse ranked in the top 25 of global systemically important banks, one of two in Switzerland.  The SNB ominously writes that the current definition for CET1 has some “vulnerabilities”. No kidding. Notably, Swiss rules allow a reweighting of risk assets when a bank puts through provisions on foreign assets, rather than capital deductions. Another SNB suggestion: banks should prepare a minimum amount of assets to pledge to the central bank.  Credit Suisse’s slow car crash will be further examined in postmortems by Finma itself and the government. Even so, SNB’s first thoughts suggest that Swiss banks including UBS face greater scrutiny and capital requirements. That cannot help their future profitability, nor investor attitudes towards banks.  Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

"Seven ways in which Credit Suisse isn’t SVB","Because nothing in Zurich ever happens suddenly ","Financial journalists only know two quotes from literature. There’s the Hemingway one about bankruptcy, and the Tolstoy one about happy and unhappy families.  In recent reporting on Credit Suisse, most reporters have been choosing the wrong quote. Silicon Valley Bank’s failure might have made it seem like all bankruptcies happen gradually then suddenly but, in truth, every unhappy bank is unhappy in its own way.  Let us count the ways: 1. Unlike for SVB, liquidity isn’t much of a problem As Twitter’s Johannes Borgen highlighted on Wednesday: 

 It’s an important point. Run risk ought to be manageable because the high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) portfolios across the entire European banking sector are thicc. As we reported overnight, CS has been able to tap the newly created Swiss National Bank’s liquidity backstop for Sfr39bn while reassuring that the volume of duration fixed income securities “is not material compared to the overall HQLA portfolio”.  CS’s liquidity coverage ratio fell from a 192 per cent average in the third quarter 2022 to as low as 120-130 per cent in the fourth, and that was when market funding was a lot cheaper. Nevertheless, at spot pricing, before taking account of the backstop, the LCR was 150 per cent — which is not great, but not justification to panic either. 2. Unlike for SVB, depositors don’t suffer overly from digitally weaponised herd mentality SVB was killed by deposit flight among a very small group of customers who all read the same Substacks, chatted in the same Slack groups and mostly took directions from the same overlord.  CS’s latest wobble came after its biggest shareholder put some words in an unfortunate combination when speaking to Bloomberg, and as the commentariat misread elevated CDS prices as a portent of doom rather than a gauge of hedging activity. There’s really not much of a parallel, risk wise. 3. Unlike for SVB, regulation is pre-emptive and probably proportionate Wednesday's statement from the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority spent a lot longer dunking on America than it did pledging support. What might look like chippy jingoism was more likely intended as signal that, at least in the short term, a forcible shutdown isn’t on the cards. The risk of waking up and finding CS equity zeroed has been taken off the table, which has cooled the mood considerably. 4. Unlike for SVB, there’s useful precedent As well as using the state backstop, CS is making tender offers to repurchase “certain OpCo senior debt securities for cash of up to approximately Sfr3bn”. It’s a similar short-squeeze gambit to the one Deutsche Bank deployed in 2016, to ease jitters over its exposure to a plunge in yields.  According to JPMorgan, CS’s repurchases . . .  . . . should establish a floor under funding levels and with material tender premiums, seeks to drive valuations to more acceptable levels. While we note that tendering for the HoldCo debt with the lower cash prices might have produced a more material impact, the reality is that it would be difficult to tender for instruments that fulfil a regulatory requirement.  5. Unlike for SVB, there’s 167 years of franchise value  That’s not necessarily a good thing, to be clear. There are obvious downsides to having a franchise that’s associated with Archegos, Greensill Capital, Mozambique tuna bonds, Bulgarian money laundering, corporate espionage, etc.   Confidence in CS’s investment bank is widely considered to be shot, optimism about the three-year turnround is fragile, deposit bleed has yet to be stanched, and the wealth management division is losing money, which is the finance equivalent of jumping off a boat and missing the water.  Co-ordinated action to save CS from a run may have bought time to figure out the next move, but probably not much. Here’s what Barclays forecasts: In terms of our estimates, independent of recent events, we anticipate very material losses in 2023 (CHF4.5bn), and in 2024 (CHF2.9bn), when management is aiming for a break even performance. As such, we see the CET1 ratio dropping below the interim target in 2024 (as a result of losses), but still above regulatory minima at c.12%.   There’s a bear case to make along the lines of “if liquidity’s fine then why is CS drawing down state aid and damaging its franchise?”, to which the answer is probably, “what franchise?” The above is why CS is already on its seventh restructuring plan since 2011, with an eighth likely to be on the way shortly.  6. Unlike for SVB, there are options other than the most drastic one A full closure of CS’s investment bank would cost about Sfr10bn. It’s something that should be considered, since given point 5 its counterparties have had plenty of time to prepare for the worst.  CS’s prime broking business has already been shuttered and management is quietly rolling off the risk. The bottom line is that CS just isn’t that important to global financial stability any more, which gives the route of an IB closure and the partial float of Credit Suisse Switzerland an appealing elegance. Whether markets have the stomach for another complicated and long-dated restructuring plan is the bigger question, to which the answer is probably no. 7. Unlike for SVB, there is one obvious buyer (even if it may be a reluctant one) Looking at you here, UBS.   JPMorgan analysts were telling clients overnight that a sale of CS, probably to UBS, was the most obvious outcome. In its scenario the creation of a Swiss national champion would lead to . . .  . . . an IPO or spinoff to NewCo S/Hs of the Swiss Bank worth CHF 10bn as combined market share equals roughly 30% and hence we see too much concentration risk and market share control in the Swiss domestic market; ii) full closure of the IB with CHF 30bn of badwill the IB and group restructuring can be financed ‘through CSG’ itself; and iii) retention of WM/AM. We see material WM overlap especially in UHNW with both UBS and CSG at 55% of AuM in UHNW we estimate as well as overlap in Asia and Swiss onshore business.[ . . . ]In our view, Julius Bear would benefit the most gaining advisors and market share in such a scenario involving the restructuring process of UBS-CS. Hence Julius BAER would be our preferred Swiss Wealth Manager currently. For UBS we do believe on an absolute basis even with revenue overlaps, due to the Swiss Bank IPO value creation to S/Hs and badwill creation, a NewCo UBS would be a positive investment proposition in the L-T. We note CSG, with a leverage exposure to Swiss GDP of 84% and UBS at 133%, will also lead to a gold plating of UBS capital and liquidity position.In terms of European Banks and counterparty concerns as we expressed earlier we are less concerned than at the time DB was in distress or let alone Lehman. Hence we think share price underperformance of wholesale banks such as DBK (4.7x P/E 2024E), BARC (3.9x P/E 2024E), BNP (6.9x P/E 2024E) as well as by some Money Center Banks is overdone. CSG is trading at P/TBV of 0.2x 2024E, UBS is trading at 7.6x P/E and Julius BAER at 9.6x PE 2024E on our forecasts. At pixel time CS shares are up 20 per cent and financial journalists are strongly encouraged to read other books.  Further reading:— FT.com/Credit Suisse","16.03.2023"
"Global bankers ‘very pro-China’, says UBS chair","Colm Kelleher makes remarks at Hong Kong financial forum designed to woo international investors","Global bankers are all “very pro-China”, UBS chair Colm Kelleher said at a financial forum in Hong Kong, where Chinese officials sought to woo rattled international investors on Wednesday. Hong Kong is seeking to boost its status as an international financial centre at the conference, after a clampdown on civil society and years of strict pandemic restrictions triggered an exodus and raised concerns the city was losing business to rival Asian hub Singapore. Chinese officials used pre-recorded video interviews to reassure international investors of the country’s economic strength as it battles a property sector crisis and flagging growth induced by its strict zero-Covid policy.   “We’re not reading the American press, we actually buy the [China] story,” said Kelleher, chair of the world’s biggest wealth manager. “But it is a bit [of a matter of] waiting for zero-Covid to open up in China to see what will happen.” His reference to the media was an apparent joke and a nod to earlier remarks made by Fang Xinghai, vice-chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, during a pre-recorded segment of the event. Fang told attendees: “I would advise international investors to find out what’s really going on in China and what’s the real intention of our government by themselves. Don’t read too much of the international media.”  Fang’s comments, which came after a record sell-off of Chinese equities last week in the wake of President Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power, prompted laughs and applause from the audience. “Don’t bet against China and Hong Kong,” he added. Kelleher was speaking on a panel with Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon, Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman, Blackstone chief financial officer Michael Chae and Bank of China president Liu Jin.  Earlier in the day, Yi Gang, governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he hoped to “achieve a soft landing” when asked about the central bank’s support and outlook for the property market, which has been battling a liquidity crisis and wave of defaults.   State-run media in China have pushed a narrative of economic resilience and recovery coming out of the Communist party’s 20th congress, where Xi secured an unprecedented third term as leader. Analysts, however, say China’s economic outlook has been deteriorating in recent months as Xi’s strict zero-Covid policy has led to lockdowns across large swaths of the country.  Among the latest high-profile lockdowns reported by international media this week include the shutting of Shanghai Disneyland after one guest tested positive for Covid-19 and the fleeing of workers in the world’s largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou to escape the threat of quarantine. “China’s overall lockdowns have been steadily tightening since August and ratcheted further over the past month,” said Ernan Cui, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.  “Even if the Covid containment regime remains largely effective and another wave of lockdowns is mostly avoided, the cost of controlling the sub-variants is clearly rising fast and will further drag on the economy,” Cui said. The Hong Kong government has made a particular point of ensuring the forum goes forward as planned, allowing attendees some respite from certain pandemic restrictions that apply elsewhere in the city.  Financial secretary Paul Chan mingled with the crowd of financiers and spoke without a mask, despite recently testing positive for Covid. On the sidelines, HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn said he believed China’s prospects were positive when asked if he felt Hong Kong was back in business. In an apparent rejoinder made later in the day, Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, told attendees: “I’d like to commend the international media, and I believe what I read in the international media.”","02.11.2022"
"Credit Suisse’s fate casts a shadow over the European banking sector","American and Asian rivals could benefit from the uncertainty created by way holders of AT1 bonds have been treated","The writer is a former chief executive of Credit Suisse Like everyone else, I watched the events unfolding in Zurich in recent days with something akin to stunned disbelief. When I stepped down as the chief executive of Credit Suisse, it had just posted its highest profits for 10 years after a deep restructuring. And though I managed the tricky situations that developed under my watch effectively, things have gone wrong in the years since. Little more than three years later, the same bank, part of Switzerland’s national fabric for more than 160 years, was ushered into the arms of its biggest rival, UBS, over the course of a frantic weekend.  Sadly, there will be a human impact on the many thousands of people, and many former colleagues, who are likely to lose their jobs following this rescue. Since I left the bank in February 2020, I have mostly refrained from commenting on Credit Suisse, but the turn of events now compels me to speak. A big part of my job as chief executive — helped by a dedicated team — was setting a new course towards wealth management and away from investment banking to fully realise the potential of the franchise. But just as big a task was strengthening the balance sheet, which ranked bottom of the list of systemically important banks when I joined. So we raised SFr10bn of equity, tackled multibillion-dollar legacy issues, from the US mortgage securities market to Mozambique, cut risk exposure by 45 per cent and eliminated more than SFr100bn of impaired assets. Risk was always a priority for me. It was clear that the bank’s risk systems needed a major investment and that this would be a large, multiyear undertaking. I often described this as a 10-year job, which was clearly not complete by the time I left. A few days into the role, one of my first decisions was to approve $150mn of new investment in risk management systems. We also increased compliance staff by more than 40 per cent, even when we were conducting a major cost-cutting programme across the bank.  It was clear that until risk and compliance systems were materially improved, behaviour and culture would be more important than ever. After the initial and well-publicised losses in distressed debt experienced in late 2015, I shut that business down, reduced our risk appetite and made sure everybody understood I wanted to hear bad news when it happened. We managed to get through 16 quarters without a serious issue, had more than $200bn of wealth management inflows, cut risk and cut both operating and legacy costs. By 2019, Credit Suisse was making nearly as much profit as its new owner UBS. Its current plight saddens me. But we need to focus on what happens now. UBS has said it will keep Credit Suisse’s “crown jewel”, the standalone Swiss bank I created that has been a consistently strong performer despite the wider group’s issues. However, regulators should look again at whether they ought to allow a single domestic player of this size in the Swiss market. Arguably, UBS attempting to absorb CS’s Swiss universal bank would do little except add thousands more job losses to those already expected in investment banking. From a wider perspective, policymakers need to raise investors’ confidence in the European banking sector. The treatment of the holders of additional tier 1 bonds (AT1s) has created significant uncertainty. What happened will play out in the courts for years.   There is a basic principle that common equity takes the hit first. It seems that the treatment of AT1s — even if correct under the current Swiss rules — will raise the cost of capital for Swiss banks and for European banks. This will have some of their US peers rubbing their hands. AT1s or “cocos” are an important source of capital for European banks, and because of the market appetite, interest rates may not have fully reflected the risks involved. This new layer of uncertainty will have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the European banking sector. Net net, US and Asian rivals could come out of all this relatively stronger. A related issue is that shareholders were denied a vote with emergency law changes, which shocked many investors and market participants. Of course, this was an emergency. The alternative could have been far worse. But after the thousands of hours spent working on things like resolution plans since 2008, the episode shows the need for further work to codify approaches to banking crises and be more transparent with investors over the likely response from policymakers. We must learn the lessons from the past few days — otherwise Credit Suisse will have fallen in vain.

"UK fund giant L&G bets on Ecuador’s Galápagos debt experiment","Britain’s biggest asset manager buys $250mn of bonds in a sign of growing investor interest in debt-for-nature swaps","The UK’s largest asset manager Legal & General has thrown its weight behind a landmark debt deal by Ecuador, in a sign of growing investor interest in swaps that shrink countries’ interest payments while raising money for environmental conservation.  A unit of Legal & General Investment Management snapped up $250mn of the record-setting Galápagos deal in May — the largest ever so-called debt-for-nature swap — making it the largest cornerstone investor in the deal, it told the Financial Times. The transaction allows Ecuador to exchange $1.63bn of dollar-denominated bonds for a $656mn loan at much lower repayment rates, on the condition the country must put some of the money it has saved towards environmental conservation.  LGIM’s buy-in provides big-name institutional support for an experimental asset class that other developing countries around the world are expected to adopt. Debt-for-nature swaps were traditionally brokered by governments and non-governmental organisations, but Credit Suisse — which started arranging this transaction before its recent purchase by UBS — structured swaps for Belize in 2021 and Barbados last year, worth $364mn and $146.5mn respectively. “We like this type of transaction partly because of its inclusive capitalism [theme] and partly because of the returns,” said Jake Harper, investment manager at LGIM. “Part of our plan . . . is that we are in debt-for-nature swaps like this throughout the world. It could become quite a significant part of our strategy as long as the risks stack up.” Ecuador’s deal will save the Andean nation $1.13bn in reduced debt service costs, according to Credit Suisse, while Ecuador will spend $323mn on marine conservation in the Galápagos Islands over the next 18-and-a-half years. Much of it will support the new Hermandad Marine Reserve and the existing Galápagos Marine Reserve, while there will be funding for an endowment for marine conservation. A credit guarantee provided by the Inter-American Development Bank, and insurance by the US International Development Finance Corporation protecting against upheavals linked to government interference or political violence, keep the risk low, added Harper.  Moody’s said the bonds had been sold at “deeply distressed” prices, technically making the swap a “default”. “You might question why would a pension fund want to invest in an asset class like this,” Harper said. “We do get asked internally, are we just lending money to a sovereign to restructure debt?” Still, Moody’s gave the new debt a provisional investment-grade Aa2 credit rating — its third-highest — and 16 notches above Ecuador’s junk Caa3 rating. Ecuador’s sovereign bonds yield about 22 per cent, while the new bond, which will run until 2041, has a 5.6 per cent coupon. There is a seven-year grace period on principal repayments. In Ecuador — where the Galápagos Islands are a symbol of national pride — the news was met with front-page headlines that briefly competed with a political crisis in which the president has called snap elections after facing impeachment charges. “Our currency is biodiversity,” Ecuador’s foreign minister, Gustavo Manrique, who worked on the deal while previously serving as environment minister, told the FT.  Most, but not all, of the Ecuadorean bonds have been placed, primarily with pension funds, insurance companies and asset managers. A number of other countries are keen to do such deals, and are hoping that the interest in Ecuador’s deal signals growing investor demand. Ecuador also plans to restructure more of its own debt using this mechanism. “We’re seeing different ways of capitalising on biodiversity,” Pablo Arosemena, Ecuador’s finance minister, told the FT. “We have a portfolio of various projects of this sort.”  Arosemena said the government was pursuing a debt-for-nature swap involving corridors in the Amazon rainforest. That deal would involve “keeping oil below the ground in certain zones, and monetising that action for conservation”, he said.  Gabon, Sri Lanka and Colombia have previously also said they are considering similar deals. The Nature Conservancy, a US non-profit that worked on the Belize and Barbados deals, told the FT it was in talks with dozens of countries it considers good candidates. But some remain sceptical of the benefits of such deals. Credit Suisse’s new owner UBS has not yet thrown its own weight behind the biodiversity-themed debt experiment spearheaded by its former rival.  “It’s clearly not a silver bullet,” said Frederic de Mariz, head of ESG at UBS in Latin America. “My main concern is how you make this scaleable, and make sure we don’t combine one topic, which is debt restructuring, and another topic, very different, this payment for nature services.” Mariz added that there was a “limited pool of money” from investors willing to give up financial returns in exchange for a nature-based return. Farnam Bidgoli, managing director and global head of ESG solutions at HSBC, said the London-based lender was in “active conversations” about structuring its own debt-for-nature swaps, in markets where it already has relationships with government debt issuers and creditors. But she warned that high transaction fees paid by the issuer meant the terms could be less favourable than traditional debt relief measures such as concessional loans. “From a government perspective this would not be your first option.” Critics also point out that only some of the savings from debt servicing are funnelled towards conservation in this type of deal. “My main concern is that the headline numbers suggest a meaningful transfer of resources for marine conservation whereas in fact those sums are relatively small on an annual basis,” said Graham Stock, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at RBC BlueBay Asset Management.

"Fall of Credit Suisse shows more work is needed on bank risk","Lessons should be drawn from how the crisis at the bank developed","The writer is managing partner and head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments Bank investors are well aware of the risks; they know that banking relies on trust and that sentiment can change quickly. The crisis now faced by Credit Suisse is, however, a previously unseen phenomenon. Every single bank failure I can remember was caused by hidden losses, be they in loan books, derivatives books or bond books. Even though this latest episode of market panic was triggered by bond losses in midsized American banks, there is no suggestion that the current Credit Suisse crisis stems from this problem. So how did this happen and what are the lessons we can draw from the crisis and the intervention by the Swiss authorities?   In shaky markets following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, an awkward statement by Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, saying that it would not provide any further assistance, was enough to send the bank’s share price into a tailspin. Financial assistance is the Chekhov’s gun of banking: mention it and it is very likely that it will be used before the end of the play. It is not a coincidence that Credit Suisse has become the main target of the markets. For years now, it has been embroiled in a series of scandals and management controversies. It sometimes feels like its annual report is nothing but a long list of litigations both old and new along with acknowledgment of poor risk controls. Consequently, CS has established itself as the weakest link of the European globally systemic banks. It is a bit of an odd weak link, because it had plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity. It is not the only bank with low profitability and is not even the only one that had deposit outflows in the fourth quarter. And it is certainly not the only bank to face scandals over the years. It is, however, the one that had all these weaknesses at the worst possible moment. What were the options to stop the bleed? The Swiss authorities did not really have a choice. Ultimately, Credit Suisse’s own clients decided its fate, not the investors. They had made up their minds and withdrew funds. Merging with UBS is an obvious solution that was on everyone’s mind. Maybe the Swiss authorities will be criticised because they reportedly did not do more to open the bidding war to non-Swiss players, but can we really blame them? Can anyone remember a bank failure resolved in a weekend with a foreign white knight? This is why UBS has been in a very strong negotiating position. People will argue about the possibility of litigation losses, further bad loans or the cost of winding down the investment bank of Credit Suisse. But UBS is paying a fraction of the bank’s shareholder equity, estimated at SFr45bn ($49bn) at the end of last year. Even after accounting for the likely sale of some assets in the Swiss retail bank to manage competition issues, this deal is likely to be very value enhancing for UBS shareholders. Restoring client confidence and low funding costs could also be a game-changer for profitability.  It appears bondholders, however, are going to be forced to take a loss. In the longer term, this could raise issues of financial stability given this case was driven by market panic on a bank with high capital and liquidity that was supported by its supervisor.  There are many lessons to be drawn from this crisis, but my hope is that ultimately the one that will prevail is this: a bank’s culture is too important to treat it lightly. A bout of market volatility after internal failings or even a banker gone rogue can jeopardise the work of tens of thousands of hard-working people who will feel both betrayed and frowned upon just because they worked in the wrong company. Regulators and investors have done a lot of work on this, but evidently there is still much to do.

"There are several reasons to worry about the health of Europe’s banks","Credit Suisse was the region’s problem child but other institutions are not immune to the turmoil","Banking is a massive, complicated and delicate confidence trick. Normally it works fine. But as soon as people worry that it could fall apart, it often does, sometimes spectacularly. So when an old friend, an entrepreneur in Geneva, messaged me last week to say he had moved his money out of Credit Suisse, having already taken his company’s account elsewhere, it was clear that Switzerland’s second-largest lender was in trouble. The 167-year-old institution, with a SFr531bn balance sheet and more than 50,000 employees, was sold to its bigger Swiss rival for SFr3bn in a rescue deal at the weekend orchestrated by government authorities that imposed heavy losses on shareholders and wiped out SFr16bn of risky bonds. By all accounts, Credit Suisse was not given much choice about whether to accept it.  What caused such a dramatic demise of what was until recently still one of Europe’s 25 biggest banks? Is this a sign of a wider crisis brewing in the European banking sector? The first point to make is that Credit Suisse has been the problem child of European banking for several years after suffering multiple scandals, losses, management shake-ups and restructuring plans. When three midsized US lenders, including Silicon Valley Bank, collapsed earlier this month following a rapid withdrawal of depositors’ money, investors started to fret about which other banks could be vulnerable.  Credit Suisse caught their eye. Having already seen rich clients pull more than 10 per cent of their money out of its wealth management unit in just a few months last year, the bank was still suffering outflows of cash, at one point topping SFr10bn a day. The run on deposits only accelerated last week after the chair of the Saudi National Bank, which bought a 10 per cent stake in Credit Suisse last year, unhelpfully ruled out providing the Swiss lender with any more financial assistance. European regulators have rushed to express their confidence in the strength of the region’s banks. Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the European Central Bank, said last week that the sector was “resilient”, with much higher capital than in the previous crisis a decade ago, robust liquidity levels and “quite limited” exposure to Credit Suisse or the failed US banks.   De Guindos added that rising interest rates were “positive in terms of the margins of European banks”. Increasing the interest they earn on loans faster than the rate they pay to depositors helped eurozone banks to achieve a 7.6 per cent return on equity last year, the highest for over a decade. Bad loans, long the Achilles heel of eurozone banks, have fallen steadily from over €1tn eight years ago to below €350bn last year, equal to less than 2 per cent of total loans. However, while Europe’s banks are undoubtedly in a stronger position than in the previous crisis, when several had to be bailed out by their governments, this does not mean they will be immune to the latest turmoil. There are several reasons to worry. First, Credit Suisse also had healthy capital and liquidity ratios — both only slightly below eurozone averages last year — but that did not save it once confidence evaporated. Second, eurozone banks are still not earning enough profit to cover their cost of capital, which is around 9 per cent for many of them, meaning they are effectively destroying shareholder value.  A further concern is the flipside of rising interest rates, which the ECB have increased at an unprecedented pace to tackle soaring inflation. This will hit the value of the banks’ vast holdings of government bonds, mortgages and other debt.  Banks mostly account for these loans as if they will own them to maturity, so they do not take losses when their value falls. And many insure themselves by hedging interest rate risk. But the ECB’s head of supervision Andrea Enria said recently that many lenders were unprepared for this new environment, which would “create winners and losers”. Enria said in November that “banks should not disregard the impact that rising rates typically have on the present value of their net worth” adding this would hit their long-term earnings, capital and ability to attract investment. More broadly, the whiff of fear in financial markets is likely to make lenders much more cautious, reducing the flow of credit, increasing the risk of a recession and raising stress in already vulnerable areas such as commercial property — none of which is good for banks. martin.arnold@ft.com Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","20.03.2023"

"US bank stocks rise as investors assess efforts to calm turmoil","Broad indices climb ahead of Fed rate meeting this week","US bank stocks closed higher on Monday as investors assessed efforts to address turmoil in the sector and looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on US interest rates. The KBW Nasdaq Bank index ended up 0.8 per cent, with heavyweights such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley rising 1.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively. However, shares of First Republic sank 48 per cent despite recent efforts to shore up the regional bank.  The gains were mirrored in Europe, where the Euro Stoxx Banks index closed up 1.3 per cent, as many of the region’s biggest names recovered from early declines.   Fears over the banking sector have spread after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US this month. In Switzerland, regulators brokered a takeover of a weakened Credit Suisse by UBS. Global central banks worked to improve access to dollar liquidity over the weekend.  UBS erased losses of more than 14 per cent to finish 1.3 per cent higher. However, France’s Société Générale was down 0.8 per cent and shares in Credit Suisse dropped 55.7 per cent as its shareholders faced a heavy writedown in value from the UBS takeover. In the US, benchmark stock indices moved higher, with the blue-chip S&P 500 adding 0.9 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising 0.4 per cent. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index rose 0.8 per cent while the FTSE 100 gained 0.9 per cent and the CAC 40 in Paris added 1.3 per cent. “The [Credit Suisse/UBS] deal at the margin reduced the systemic risk of banks failing,” said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. He added that there was “little conviction in the market . . . it’s a bounce caused by risk to the banking sector and the economy being reduced”.  Investors’ focus is on the Fed’s meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, in which its latest interest rate decision will be decided. Investors are pricing in a 53 per cent chance of a 0.25 percentage point rise, and a 47 per cent chance of no change. Traders expected the benchmark interest rate to fall to 4 per cent by December. “They have to show that they are still keeping their eye on the inflationary ball,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at the Bank of Montreal, who expects the Fed to add a quarter point to the federal funds rate. “Anything less than that will reek of panic and make them look soft.”  Analysts at ING said much of the Fed’s decision will “depend on whether a modicum of stability returns to financial markets”, particularly in the case of regional lenders.  The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose 0.1 percentage points to 3.49 per cent. The yield on the two-year note was also up 0.14 percentage points to 3.95 per cent.  One element of the rapid takeover of Credit Suisse that is fuelling jitters among debt investors is the deal’s wipeout of $17bn of the bank’s bonds. Swiss regulator Finma demanded on Sunday that SFr16bn ($17bn) of Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds, a type of bank debt designed to take losses during a crisis, be written down to zero as part of the rescue deal with UBS. The Swiss move cast doubt on the hierarchy of claims in the event of a banking failure. It was the biggest writedown ever of AT1 debt, according to Goldman Sachs. There were heavy declines in Asia, including a 7.1 per cent fall in HSBC shares in Hong Kong. “It is a wake-up call to investors that AT1 bonds carry real risks of being written off in extreme scenarios, which is also the purpose of having such bonds,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. “The move will probably trigger some sell-offs and risk rebalancing from bond investors and wealth management product holders.” Asian stocks fell. Japan’s Topix shed 1.5 per cent, while South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.8 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined 2.7 per cent. Brent crude, the international benchmark, and WTI, the US equivalent, gained 1.1 and 1.4 per cent, respectively, recovering in the afternoon after falling to their lowest price since December 2021.

"SocGen chief says European banks ‘fundamentally’ safer than US","Departing CEO believes ‘turbulence’ could persist in US after string of bank failures","The outgoing chief of France’s Société Générale’s has dismissed the risk of US banking turmoil spreading to Europe, arguing the region’s tougher regulation was a “fundamental contrast” that helped shield the sector.  Frédéric Oudéa, who is stepping down this month after 15 years at the helm of the bank, said he was “confident the European banking sector would continue to be extremely solid in the coming quarters”.  In the US, he added: “I think that turbulence could continue.”  “You have a lot of smaller and medium-sized banks [in the US] that are not regulated in the same way as in the eurozone and Europe, where you have stability derived from having a framework that takes in to account all these crisis simulations,” Oudéa said after SocGen posted higher profits for the first quarter.  The eurozone’s banking regime has remained fundamentally the same since its introduction in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, whereas former president Donald Trump rolled back some stress tests and requirements for smaller US banks with assets of up to $250bn.  Such institutions now do not have to take into account some unrealised losses on assets in their capital requirements, particularly in their bond portfolios. The US has suffered several bank failures in recent weeks, but Credit Suisse and the much smaller UK business of Silicon Valley Bank are the only European lenders to come close to collapse.  Second-tier European banks have also not suffered the same level of customer withdrawals as US regional lenders, mainly because their deposit bases are less concentrated. “You’ve seen deposits at some US banks drop by 10 per cent in a week . . . look at how exceptionally sticky deposits have been across all the big eurozone banks,” Oudéa added. “There’s a fundamental contrast here.”  Failed US lenders such as SVB and Signature Bank had high levels of clients in the tech sector, many of whom withdrew their deposits at the same time. Regulators have highlighted the interconnected nature of such customers and the role social media played in spreading rumours about the banks’ problems.   The US banking market also has a higher level of competition for deposits from other savings products such as money market funds. More than $340bn flowed into US money market funds in March — the highest rate since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic three years ago — much of which came from regional banks.  By contrast, European banks have maintained high levels of liquidity, highlighted by UBS taking on Credit Suisse and HSBC absorbing SVB UK, and other lenders, such as UniCredit, boosting shareholder returns. “European banks do not exhibit a combination of large unrealised losses on securities portfolios and highly confidence-sensitive funding models,” S&P analyst Giles Edwards said in a recent report. He added that the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS was a unique case due to specific “business and risk management deficiencies”. Some European banks initially suffered when tech-focused SVB collapsed in mid-March, with investors taking flight even though few were directly exposed to the California-based bank. Since then, retail deposits across Europe have shown little sign of being depleted. The heavy outflows suffered by Credit Suisse in the days leading up to its rescue by rival UBS in March were mainly in its wealth management arm.  Banks in Europe have a lower exposure to troublesome commercial real estate than their US peers, representing about 8 per cent of the loan books at European lenders, compared with 18 per cent at US banks and 36 per cent for mid-cap US lenders, according to Jefferies.  Oudéa said commercial real estate was “probably a sector with risks” in the US, but SocGen said on Friday its exposure to the sector stood at 3.2 per cent of its total, with the bulk skewed towards Europe.  This month, SocGen’s investment bank chief Slawomir Krupa is set to replace Oudéa, who took over as chief executive in 2008 after a rogue trading scandal, if shareholders approve the appointment.  Part of Krupa’s mandate will be to try and revive a share price that has never recovered since the financial crisis, in spite of several restructurings. SocGen’s share price slumped 26 per cent in March and has only partially recovered since, up 13 per cent. Rising interest rates have caused some issues for European banks, even though broadly they should boost margins. In France, for instance, caps on the rate at which mortgages can be repriced is damping the benefits for lenders and making it harder to offer home loans. SocGen on Friday reported a slight increase in deposits compared with the first quarter of last year. It said mortgage origination in France had fallen from a year earlier. Net income was up 5.7 per cent in the first three months of the year to €868mn, ahead of forecasts.  “French retail revenues in the short term continue to show pressure,” Barclays analyst Amit Goel said of the results, adding, however, that the bank’s performance had been solid in investment banking.  Strong bond trading revenues and lower charges on non-performing loans during the quarter helped SocGen offset sliding revenues in its French retail bank — one area that it said was likely to underperform throughout 2023.","12.05.2023"
"Risky AT1 bonds rebound from plunge after Credit Suisse wipeout","Assurances from EU and UK that Swiss decision does not set a precedent helps market recover","The global market for risky bank debt has rebounded from the sharp sell-off triggered by the wipeout of $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds as part of its takeover by rival UBS last month. The price of additional tier 1 debt, also known as contingent convertibles or AT1s, plunged after Swiss regulators shocked investors by writing the value of the bonds down to zero. But a Bloomberg index of contingent convertible bonds globally has risen 10 per cent from its low on March 20 to a similar level to that seen before UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse. An iBoxx index of AT1 prices has also recovered to pre-takeover levels.  The gradual recovery in the market comes as fears of a broader banking crisis following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month begin to ebb. Investors say they have been reassured by statements from regulators elsewhere that the Swiss decision to leave AT1 holders with nothing would not set a precedent for the wider $260bn market. AT1s are a class of risky bank debt that can be converted into equity, or wiped out entirely, if a lender’s capital levels fall below a certain level. They were introduced in the wake of the global financial crisis to ensure that bondholders would absorb some of the losses in the event of bank failures, in order to shield depositors and avoid taxpayer-funded bailouts. But Swiss regulators upended the normal hierarchy by wiping out AT1 holders despite giving shareholders $3.25bn in the UBS deal, undermining confidence in the broader market.   The European Central Bank and Bank of England were among the institutions that publicly said they would stick to the typical order of precedence and that equity holders should be wiped out first in any future bank failure.  “It’s been very good for the long-term health of the AT1 market that the other jurisdictions have come out and made their positions clear,” said Mark Holman, chief executive of TwentyFour Asset Management. “The long-term future of the AT1 market is not very different to the past, it’s a big market.” Andrzej Skiba, head of US fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management, said regulators still saw AT1 debt “as a core part of the capital toolkit for the future” and that banks “also want to use those instruments going forward”.   He added that the recent collapse in prices presented a buying opportunity for some investors, “especially focusing on the strongest, systemically important banks”. Despite the recent recovery, AT1 prices remain well below levels seen at the start of the year, amid wider investor concerns over the health of the banking sector on both sides of the Atlantic. Swiss debt is still seen as relatively unappealing. A Swiss franc-denominated UBS AT1 bond has risen just 3 per cent in price from its recent low. Banks are also still wary of issuing new AT1 bonds. Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group this week delayed issuing new debt planned for April until at least mid-May.

"Credit Suisse AT1s: legal battle may bake in a Swiss discount","The case could prove excruciating for Switzerland","Angry investors are parking metaphorical tanks on Paradeplatz in Zurich’s financial district. Holders of $17bn in Credit Suisse AT1 bonds are squaring up for a legal fight with Switzerland. This promises to be as fierce as the scrap between Argentina and US hedge funds over a 2001 debt default.  Swiss authorities wiped out $17bn of the securities when they engineered a takeover of the struggling lender by UBS. This came as a bigger shock than the rescue deal itself. Why? Equity is supposed to evaporate before AT1s, but Credit Suisse shareholders have been promised UBS stock worth some $3bn. Moreover, AT1 securities — designed to absorb capital losses — were entirely wiped out even though Credit Suisse was well-capitalised.  Law firms such Quinn Emanuel and Pallas are mustering disgruntled bondholders. Claims including compensation should easily exceed the value of the bonds. The legal argument may run like this. In an insolvency, Swiss law decrees that equity absorbs losses before debt. Anyone working to stave off an insolvency is precluded from disregarding that.  Swiss AT1 bonds are bound by fine print envisaging the inversion of the hierarchy in some cases. But it is questionable whether Credit Suisse’s shotgun marriage qualified.  Switzerland hurriedly used an emergency ordinance empowering regulators to void the AT1s. Bondholders may still sue the authorities for an alleged failure to respect property rights. The whole AT1 asset class has taken a knock. If AT1s are junior to equity, buyers should get coupons higher than equity returns. Credit Suisse AT1s trade at mere cents. This intrigues hedge funds with a legal bent. The case of Switzerland vs Bondholders will be argued as hotly and lengthily as Jarndyce vs Jarndyce, a fictional probate case only benefiting lawyers. It could prove excruciating for Switzerland. It may expose exactly why officials handed UBS a $17bn sweetener at bondholders’ expense, while giving shareholders a small sop.   EU and UK regulators have reaffirmed commitment to the traditional capital hierarchy. If AT1 bonds cost issuers more than equity, no more of them will be issued and capital rules would need rejigging. The implicit message is that Switzerland is on its own. Brussels and London are shielding their own prudential regimes. If that creates a Swiss discount for regulatory capital issued by its banks, too bad.

"Credit Suisse AT1s vaporised ","CoCos go locos","Only time will tell whether UBS ends up ruing or celebrating its swoop for Credit Suisse, but the biggest losers of a wild weekend are undoubtedly investors in CS’s AT1 bonds. Additional Tier 1 bonds are a creature of the post-financial crisis regulatory architecture for Europe. In addition to carrying far more plain equity, big banks were forced to issue “contingent convertible” bonds that could be quickly transformed into more equity or just wiped out in a crisis, and thereby hopefully make a taxpayer bailout less likely.  The most common form of these CoCo bonds are just known as AT1, because their design means that banks can count them towards their overall loss-absorbing tier one capital. TwentyFour Asset Management has an excellent explainer.  Credit Suisse issued a big fat chunk of them in the past decade. Here is a presentation that Credit Suisse gave to investors last week as it was battling to save itself, which says it had SFr14.7bn of AT1 bonds outstanding at the end of 2022.  Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds were taken to the woodshed last week as fears about its financial health exploded, but this Sunday they actually rallied hard — from a lows of 20-40 cents on the dollar to 50-70 cents according to Bloomberg — as hopes grew that the UBS takeover would see them shielded. After all, if UBS was paying Credit Suisse shareholders $1bn $2bn $3bn then surely the AT1s would be shielded? They couldn’t possibly give the equity at least a consolation payment and fiddle with creditors — even if they are the most junior creditors possible? Surely? Are private creditors of Credit Suisse also exposed to the risks of the takeover?Yes. FINMA has been provided with a clearer legal basis so that part of Credit Suisse’s regulatory capital can be written off (private creditors are to share in the exposures to the tune of around CHF 17bn). This ensures that private measures are taken in addition to state measures. WHOOPS. Clearly the Swiss regulators looked at the instruments and felt confident that they have the legal backing to vaporise the AT1s. The standard threshold is when Common Equity Tier 1 falls below 7 per cent, but we think they can often be triggered at a national regulator’s discretion — basically when they reckon a bank is “non-viable”. A separate Credit Suisse press release puts the value of AT1 bonds being wiped out at CHF16bn. We’re not sure what explains the discrepancy with the Swiss government statement and last week’s presentation, but it’s probably related to different parts of the CS sprawl, with some bonds issued by the holding company and others by different subsidiaries.  What is clear is that this was a swift nuking of Credit Suisse’s AT1s. Beyond the immediate pain for the holders, we suspect this is going to be viewed . . . unfavourably by investors in the broader European AT1 market.   Now, getting zeroed at times of crisis is obviously the whole point of these securities, and it’s easy to see why the Swiss decided to do this. It will make CS far easier to swallow for UBS without indigestion. Legally, we’re sure Finma and the Swiss National Bank are fine.  But sometimes the legal niceties matter less than the optics — especially in stressed markets. And bondholders really care about being behind equity when the pain is being distributed.  Europe’s AT1 market is about €250bn, and this is the biggest wipeout since it was born. The only other example is Banco Popular’s €1.35bn AT1 bond vaporisation in 2017 — but in that case the equity was also zeroed. So while the Swiss authorities may hope that the CS takeover will draw a line under the matter they (and others) might rediscover how contagion works on Monday morning. As one of FTAV’s favourite financials guru said on Twitter.  CS confirms shareholders will get 3bn and AT1 holders 0.

Lo — who is also head of UBS Hong Kong and has more than 30 years of experience in the private banking sector — says that, apart from allowing work trips to restart, the lifting of restrictions permits wealthy clients from mainland China, south-east Asia, US, and Europe to return to the territory.  Hong Kong, which was forced to follow a version of Beijing’s zero-Covid policies involving one of the world’s longest border closures, suffered a 3.5 per cent economic contraction last year as the territory battled its most serious Covid outbreak.  It resumed quarantine-free travel with the rest of the world only late last year and did not reopen its borders with mainland China until February, after Beijing’s abrupt U-turn on Covid curbs. But, as well as giving Hong Kong a boost, the return to normal business life has revived competition with the city’s biggest regional rival — Singapore — to be Asia’s financial hub.  The south-east Asian nation stole a march on Hong Kong by reopening its doors to the world months earlier and reported 3.6 per cent growth in its gross domestic product in 2022. Other numbers tell a similar story. Singapore’s airport arrivals are back up 70 per cent of their pre-pandemic levels, while Hong Kong’s are little over half the 2019 figure. Many Chinese billionaires migrated to Singapore during the pandemic and some foreign banks moved to relocate staff from Hong Kong to the city-state. Yet, when it comes to wealth management, Lo says Hong Kong still has a significant competitive edge through its geographical closeness to mainland China — as well as a bigger capital market than many of its regional peers. Hurun, a research group that tracks the wealth of China’s richest individuals, identified nearly 138,000 families with a net worth of more than 100mn yuan ($14.5mn) as of 2022, in a report earlier this month.

In terms of the wealth pool, Singapore is well behind. Hong Kong had 67 billionaires — individuals with a net worth of at least $1bn — with cumulative wealth of $383bn last year, according to a UBS global billionaires report released in December. That compares with Singapore’s 26 billionaires, with $107bn. Both saw a dip in the number of billionaires, and in total billionaire wealth, year on year. The “past few years were tough” for the wealth management sector in Hong Kong due to Covid and the border closure, acknowledges Lo, who is married to Hong Kong’s health secretary Lo Chung-mau — author of the city’s Covid policies. But, with all travel restrictions and a 945-day mask mandate now scrapped, she maintains “Hong Kong is back”. Lo, who began her banking career in Hong Kong at a private bank in the 1980s, before working in wealth management at UBS from the mid-1990s, has held various senior positions in the Asia Pacific region — such as head of global family office and head of ultra-high net worth. “A question I asked every one of the clients when they came back here was: Did you see anything different?” she says. “They said: ‘Oh, [Hong Kong] is very busy!’ They are also surprised . . . They said: ‘Wow, it is very normal, back to normal now’.” John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has introduced incentives to attract family offices to the city.  © Li Zhihua/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images John Lee, who was appointed Hong Kong’s chief executive by Beijing in July last year, has recently been pushing for new incentives to resuscitate the city’s economy. Fresh measures for family offices with assets under management of more than $31mn — including a profits tax exemption — plus a new investment migration scheme to lure rich individuals are on the table. And a promotional campaign called “Hello Hong Kong” gave cash vouchers to visitors and 500,000 free air tickets to travellers, in an attempt to entice tourists back. Hong Kong still has the appeal, especially for some of the Chinese families, for the proximity reason Some of those incentives have proven effective. The city welcomed more than a million visitors in February, for the first time in a single month since 2020 — although that is only a quarter of pre-pandemic levels. Last week, Hong Kong also attracted dozens of top family offices from mainland China, the Middle East, the US and Europe in an “invite only” summit — all part of a government push to have them set up their regional headquarters in the territory.  It is a push that is needed to help the city catch up. Singapore had an estimated 1,500 family offices by the end of 2022 with a relatively loose tax incentive threshold of at least $7.5mn in fund size. Hong Kong’s goal is to attract “no less than 200 family offices” to expand or set up in the city by 2025. Lo insists both Hong Kong and Singapore are “important hubs in Asia”, and that growth does not have to come “at the expense of one another”. She adds: “Hong Kong still has the appeal, especially for some of the Chinese families, for the proximity reason.” As both places reopen to the world, Lo says “it becomes a level playing field”: Hong Kong being the gateway into mainland China, while Singapore opens the door to south-east Asia investment opportunities. Roughly 40 per cent of the assets under management in Hong Kong’s private wealth management industry now come from mainland China — up from about 35 per cent in 2019 — according to a report by KPMG and the Private Wealth Management Association in Hong Kong, last year. It surveyed 36 financial institutions and more than 200 wealthy clients in the city.  Tourists on Hong Kong’s harbour front. The city recently ran a campaign called ‘Hello Hong Kong’ to attract visitors back.  © Peter Parks/AFP via Getty Images That suggests a future competitive edge over Singapore, as the mainland Chinese market has been “the biggest growth opportunity for the industry”, Lo says. However, some high-net-worth individuals are becoming concerned about the geopolitical tensions in the region, Lo acknowledges. Hong Kong, following Beijing’s imposition of a national security law prompted by the 2019 protests, has cracked down on dissidents. Financial services industry executives are alarmed that opposition leaders have been jailed or have fled the city, and business figures — such as media tycoon and vocal Chinese Communist party critic Jimmy Lai — have been arrested.  “With the national security law and all that, it’s causing a lot of anxiety. But I don’t think any of them are giving up on Hong Kong,” noted entrepreneur Yenn Wong, speaking to the FT a few months ago. She added that, among the rich people that she knew, “everyone might be setting up second bases, or everyone may be having back-up plans”. Unease around the Taiwan Strait amid ongoing US-China political tensions have also created uncertainties over the stability of the city’s financial system. Singapore, in contrast, presents a more stable environment, as the city-state maintains a low-profile stance on the geopolitical situation. Lo acknowledges that challenges, including the US-China tensions, and admits that “in the short term, the geopolitical volatility will not go away”. But she adds: “If you look at it, this is not just a regional issue. You have also the Ukraine situation, right?” “Looking back on Hong Kong history, Hong Kong has been very resilient,” she argues. “We had the 1997 [handover of the city from Britain to China], the Sars [epidemic], and also, in the past, similar kinds of [geopolitical] tensions.”  On top of this has come the global banking turmoil stemming from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and UBS’s emergency takeover of Credit Suisse.  Faced with these challenges, Lo has one key piece of advice for wealthy clients: always diversify geographically and by asset class. Alternative investments, such as hedge funds and commodities, have been of growing interest among family offices, she says. Lo also says that interest in virtual assets among younger clients “will not go away” despite the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Overall, though, asset allocation to cryptocurrencies is limited. Meanwhile, more clients, in particular younger people in wealthy families, have been increasingly interested in allocating more of their funds to ESG investments and contributing to philanthropy, post-Covid. Competition for talent is another challenge, says Lo. According to government data, Singapore’s workforce grew by about 230,000 people in 2022, while Hong Kong has lost some 140,000 workers in the past two years — a talent exodus prompted by the pandemic and Beijing’s tightening political control of the city.  At UBS’s Hong Kong branch, a “small number of colleagues” did relocate to places including Singapore during the pandemic, says Lo. But the branch saw a small net expansion in its team last year, including in wealth management. Lo says the bank has been “selectively hiring.” Recruiting experienced staff in sustainable finance in the region is hard work, according to Lo. “We don’t have enough ESG talent,” she says.  Lo would like to attract people from the large pool of talent in Europe, where ESG has a much longer history, but acknowledges that this could prove difficult. Still, she believes that the growth of business in Asia, including in wealth management, will create opportunities to entice colleagues and new recruits from Europe and elsewhere in the long run. She says: “When the soil is fertile, people will come here to farm.” This article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment","30.03.2023"
"We didn’t expect the leopards to eat OUR faces, say AT1 bondholders","CoCo pops","“They’ve changed the law and they have basically stolen $16bn of bonds,” Davide Serra, founder and CEO of Algebris Investments, told investors on a call this morning. “This has been a big policy mistake, [and] they will regret it. [ . . . ] Switzerland will be the new pariah in this [loss-absorbing bond market]. They asked for it, they will have it.” The above is not unrepresentative of the market’s response to Swiss regulators ignoring Finance 101 and putting shareholders ahead of bondholders. Wiping out CS’s Sfr16bn of Additional Tier 1 capital is the trade Swiss authorities have demanded for offering exceptional help — but it’s inconsistent with UBS management’s Sfr3bn valuation of CS equity.  It’s the largest loss ever inflicted to AT1 investors since the birth of the asset class. The fear, as measured by Invesco’s AT1 Capital Bond ETF, is that it changes the rules for everyone:  Regulators elsewhere are trying to undo the damage. The European Banking Authority, The Single Resolution Board and the ECB Banking Supervision committee said in a joint statement that: The resolution framework implementing in the European Union the reforms recommended by the Financial Stability Board after the Great Financial Crisis has established, among others, the order according to which shareholders and creditors of a troubled bank should bear lossesIn particular, common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would Additional Tier One be required to be written downThis approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventionsAdditional Tier 1 is and will remain an important component of the capital structure of European banks Goldman Sachs had been telling clients on Friday that AT1 bonds were too cheap relative to high-yielders. FINMA’s action “greatly weakens” the argument, it said this morning. Whether investors treat this decision as a one-off or whether they rethink the asymmetry of their risk-reward at times of elevated financial distress remains to be seen. But in our view, it has become harder to assess the attractiveness of the current historically large spread pick-up provided by AT1 bonds vs. their HY corporate counterparts, which will likely constrain the appetite towards the AT1 asset class.  The worry now is that AT1 issuance will become more expensive. Charts on exposure and refinancing requirements via Barclays (whose own AT1 ratio is 3.9 per cent):  And text from JPMorgan: While most banks were paying 8-10% coupon cost in recent issuance of AT1, we expect that credit investors are now likely to demand a higher risk premium across the spectrum, with cost of AT1 issuance potentially rising into double digits . This implies even more pressure on funding costs and deposit betas and is likely to reduce NII sensitivity further in our view. Overall, we expect higher cost of equity for the sector, moving well into double digits as AT1 costs move up materially from here. All that needs a couple of qualifiers, the first of which is that it’s Switzerland. Constitutional priorities are often a bit weird. Analyst Andrew Lim of Societe Generale says the wiping out of AT1s is a product of “a peculiar Swiss Finish” and argues that “confidence in such instruments will not be affected in the long term.”  Second, CS was insolvent irrespective of the Sfr3bn take-under sop from UBS to famously irritable retail investors. It’s political, not equitable. Applying subordination to a token gesture would have been correct but hardly proportionate.  Or, as DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach puts it: Bloomberg reports the gunslingers who foolishly kept holding Credit Suisse’s bail-in bonds are angry they are being wiped out.  Seriously?  Put on your big boy pants and look in the mirror.  That’s where the “blame” lies.  Learn how to manage risk!— Jeffrey Gundlach (@TruthGundlach) March 20, 2023

 Thirdly, CS and UBS are outliers in the CoCo marketplace. Most AT1 debt is more protected from total wipeout. Here’s Barclays to explain the “viability event” clause: From reading the CS AT1 document and the FINMA statement, we think FINMA is using the “Viability Event” as described below in CS AT1 documentation in order to trigger permanent writedown of AT1s:A “Viability Event” will occur if either… or (ii) customary measures to improve CSG’s capital adequacy being at the time inadequate or unfeasible, CSG receives an irrevocable commitment of extraordinary support from the public sector (beyond customary transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course) that has, or imminently will have, the effect of improving CSG’s capital adequacy and without which, in the determination of FINMA, CSG would have become insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material part of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business. [ . . . ]While the writedown of the AT1 could have been the correct interpretation of the AT1 prospectus (only a legal judgement would be able to confirm that), we think the step by FINMA is likely to have been surprising given Swiss authorities perceived more friendly stance towards AT1s (eg, dividend stopper language, allowing banks to call significantly non-economic AT1s).  ... and what it means for the rest: We think the full writedown on CS AT1s is likely to have a significant impact on the broader AT1 market, with investors re-evaluating unfavourably the risks of AT1s relative to both the senior and junior parts of the capital structure.We would highlight that we are not aware of any other major non-Swiss banks issuing permanent writedown AT1 instruments (we identify SANUK 6.75% as an exception), and while other regulators do have “mandatory writedown and conversion powers” in addition to bail-in powers, our initial analysis suggests that UK and EU regulators are required to maintain subordination hierarchy while using those powers. We would acknowledge that at this point, we have only done a relatively quick scrutiny of the relevant BRRD/SRMR and UK Banking Act.Despite our initial favourable perspective as above, we would expect significantly negative reaction in the broader AT1 market on the back of these developments.One potential positive catalyst could be if the EU and UK regulators confirm that similar action (AT1 loss absorption alongside significant equity recovery) would not be possible (or extremely remote) under EU and UK law.While we remain unsure about the impact on the CS T2 CoCo, we would also expect T2 spreads to generically underperform as investors question the overall creditor hierarchy of bank capital. Meanwhile, last word to Davide Serra of Algebris, whose views on national pariahs seem to be complex and contextually subjective: “UBS has done the deal of a lifetime,” he told clients. “UBS equity is probably one of the best longs over the next three-four years. It is a no brainer and we will be adding to our UBS equity position.”  Further reading:— Credit Suisse AT1s vaporised (FTAV)","20.03.2023"
"Letter: One part of Credit Suisse story is too simplistic","From Jean-Pierre Iacopetta, Zug, Switzerland ","I congratulate you on your detailed coverage of the Credit Suisse crisis and its forced acquisition by UBS (“Risky AT1 debt rebounds after wipeout from Credit Suisse”, Report, April 6). However, I find your recurrent interpretation of the use of coco bonds to be too simplistic. It is not simply about a linear hierarchy of financial products between holders of plain vanilla stocks and bonds. After reading the prospectus for the issuance of these cocos, it becomes apparent that their buyers have sold numerous options, in the sense of derivative products. In return, the buyers received a significant premium, by way of a high coupon income. The reasons that may be invoked for the exercise of these options — one of which is the total amortisation of the value of the security — are clearly defined in the prospectus.  Although investors may understandably feel frustrated, their contractual obligations cannot be released, especially if investing is their profession. It is important to avoid the world of investment becoming a population of perceived privileged “children”, constantly protected by the authorities, and financial media alike, from any adverse effects of market events.

"Art Basel/UBS art market report predicts an all-time high in 2022","Despite a slowdown in the global economy, art spending is headed for record levels","The global economy might be headed for a slowdown, but trade in art looks to reach record levels this year with spending on track to more than double in 2022, according to the latest Arts Economics survey of more than 2,700 collectors worldwide. The findings, compiled by Clare McAndrew for Art Basel and UBS, reveal collector concerns over their carbon footprint now that in-person events are back — though not to the extent that art-shoppers want to rein in their own travel plans. McAndrew’s report finds that global imports of art and antiques, highly correlated with sales in the market, rose 41 per cent to $26.6bn in 2021 and are up a further 19 per cent in 2022, using aggregated data from countries reporting in the first six months of the year — the majority by value, McAndrew confirms. The value of art exports increased too, by 47 per cent in the same six-month period, having already grown 38 per cent last year, and after a slump in the pandemic year of 2020, the report finds.  For the first half of this year, the survey finds that the median expenditure on fine art, decorative art and antiques was $180,000, higher than for all of 2021 ($164,000) and estimated to rise to $372,000 by the end of this year. McAndrew cautions some over-optimism on the part of buyers, who were surveyed in August, but says the preliminary findings suggest that cross-border trade in art “could reach an historical peak” in 2022. The report shows how the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic didn’t touch those collectors spending more than $1mn on art each year. These bigger spenders have risen from 18 per cent of respondents in 2019 to 29 per cent in the first half of 2022 — with 34 per cent planning to spend at least $1mn by year end, including 14 per cent who estimate spending more than $10mn.  Art fairs are back in force and favour, with 338 live events in the planning for this year, a fall of only 6 per cent (22 fairs) from the pre-pandemic year of 2019 and a considerable rise from the 130 live events held in 2020. New fairs on the scene include two from the major players, namely Frieze Seoul and Paris+ par Art Basel.  This might all be good news for the art market, but a sobering, recurring theme in McAndrew’s recent reports is that while collectors voice growing concerns about the environmental impact of their high-end hobby and show a willingness to pay a premium for sustainable options, the majority (77 per cent) seem unfussed by their own aviation emissions and plan overall to travel more to events next year. Only 12 per cent say they expect to reduce their trips, and the vast majority of these (83 per cent) say that this is primarily due to the risks of Covid-19.  “In some ways, the art market is more sustainable than other luxury sectors — art is not a disposable item — but travel is the elephant in the room,” McAndrew tells the Financial Times.  Meanwhile, there has been only a “slight shift” in behaviour towards a de-globalised, more locally focused scene, McAndrew finds, as trade consolidates further within a smaller number of market hubs, primarily New York, London and Hong Kong.  Collecting too has become more concentrated. Across all regions combined, the Boomer generation (defined as aged between 58 and 75) generally spent at the highest levels and tended towards artists who were familiar to them and from galleries they already knew. Collectors from Asia were found to be more open-minded with just over half those surveyed in mainland China reporting that they dealt only with new galleries this year, by far the highest percentage overall. Paintings are still the most popular medium, accounting for 23 per cent of collections, with sculpture in the second slot at 12 per cent. In the next 12 months, of those planning to buy, 80 per cent opt for paintings, with sculpture again the next most popular medium with a 55 per cent interest. There is still demand for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) despite the crypto winter. The report records data from nonfungible.com that the value of sales of digital art with an NFT fell from $2.4bn in the second half of 2021 to $610mn in the first six months of this year. But art collectors are still on board: their median spend here reached $46,000 in the first half of this year, up from $44,000 last year. They expect to spend a median $96,000 in this field in 2022. Online buying options have grown increasingly attractive after the investment made by art businesses during the pandemic. But the report finds overall that “While the pandemic offered an example of how the market might function differently, the desire for [high net worth] collectors to see artworks in person, particularly higher-priced works, versus the sustainability of doing so, is still swinging very much in favour of the former.” ‘A Survey of Global Collecting in 2022’ is at https://www.artbasel.com/about/initiatives/the-art-market  ","03.11.2022"
"Credit Suisse investors sue Swiss regulator over bond wipeout","Complaint accuses Finma of failing to behave ‘proportionately’ and ‘in good faith’","Investors representing $4.5bn of wiped-out Credit Suisse bonds have filed a lawsuit against Switzerland’s banking regulator, in a dispute which challenges the country’s reputation as the world’s most politically stable and reliable financial centre. The claim is the first to be brought by holders of $17bn of Credit Suisse convertible bonds which were rendered worthless by the bank’s government-orchestrated rescue by rival UBS last month. It is the opening salvo in what lawyers have told bondholders is likely to be a multiyear process in the Swiss courts. By value alone, the case is one of the biggest bondholder disputes to embroil a sovereign country. One lawyer involved compared it to the long-running saga concerning Argentine government creditors who were eventually paid out $9.3bn in 2016 in the “sovereign debt trial of the century”.   The legal challenge is directed against the Swiss financial regulator, Finma, and was filed by the law firm Quinn Emanuel in the city of St Gallen in eastern Switzerland on Wednesday.  Three people with direct knowledge of the claim provided information on it, including a typed summary of the main legal points it contains, to the Financial Times. The full claim is not public, according to the rules governing the court in St Gallen, which adjudicates on constitutional and administrative disputes.  The complaint accuses Finma of having acted unconstitutionally, by failing to behave “proportionately” and “in good faith” when it ordered Credit Suisse to cancel the $17bn of convertible “AT1” bonds on March 19. Finma acted based on what it claimed were rights available to it, as the bank’s regulator, under the hybrid instruments’ own terms. An emergency ordinance, simultaneously issued by the Swiss government, explicitly expanded Finma’s powers under Swiss law to do so. In the days that followed, bondholders accused Bern of having arbitrarily changed legislation to facilitate an act of expropriation — their fury piqued in particular by the fact that nominally subordinate Credit Suisse shareholders will see $3.25bn worth of UBS shares given to them.  Quinn Emanuel’s case in St Gallen seeks to formally repeal Finma’s decision. It leaves open the question of compensation.  Despite bondholders’ publicly aired grievances, the legal case does not claim that Finma acted beyond its legal authority, nor that the government’s emergency ordinance was enacted without proper authority. The law firm has advised bondholders that trying to challenge the constitutional right of the Swiss government to evoke emergency powers, in what was a potentially economically explosive situation, is an unwise legal strategy. Instead the case hinges on constitutionally-enshrined protections for due process, arguing that Finma’s right to act was conflated by its officials with its necessity to act. The complaint argues that Finma was obliged under Articles 5 and 9 of the Swiss constitution to arrive at a decision “in good faith and in a non-arbitrary manner” and did not do so.  It also argues that Article 36, paragraph 3 was violated, which stipulates that “any restrictions on fundamental rights must be proportionate”. The right to property is a fundamental right in Swiss law. The fact that shareholders were compensated, but bondholders were not, demonstrates that consideration was not given to proportionality, Quinn Emanuel will argue.   Finma said that it had already publicly explained its decision and had no further comments to make.  Lawyers working with bondholders stressed that there was still a huge amount of information which the government had withheld using official secrecy laws. Details about the decision making ahead of Credit Suisse’s takeover will be fundamental to a successful case. Of particular interest will be information regarding why Finma and the Swiss government decided that a takeover by UBS was the only viable option and what negotiations they engaged in with the bank to secure its participation.  One advantage of pursuing the litigation in St Gallen will be that the court there does not rely solely on evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, and can itself demand documentation and testimony from the government and Finma. Quinn Emanuel’s lawyers are also eagerly anticipating the possible formation of a powerful commission of inquiry by Swiss parliamentarians when they reconvene next month.  The commission will have powers to override Bern’s use of official secrecy laws and can compel politicians, regulators and bankers to give sworn testimony to it.  Other legal strategies are still on the table. They include a civil challenge to the contractual basis of Finma’s action according to the bond’s terms, and potential lawsuits against Credit Suisse directors or executives for allegedly misleading the market in the days ahead of the bank’s near-collapse.  Beyond Switzerland, affected bondholders from countries that have signed bilateral investment treaties with Bern, such as Singapore, may also seek redress through arbitration mechanisms.

"Japan’s SMFG resumes AT1 bond sales in first big issuance since Credit Suisse wipeout","$1bn offering comes as investors’ fears ease that Swiss regulators’ decision to write down debt sets precedent","Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group sold ¥140bn ($1bn) in additional tier 1 bonds on Wednesday, marking the first issuance of the debt by a big bank since the turmoil caused by the $17bn wipeout of Credit Suisse bonds threw doubt on the future of the market. Global banks had placed new offerings of the so-called AT1 bonds on hold after Swiss regulators shocked investors by writing down the value of Credit Suisse AT1 debt to zero as part of the lender’s takeover by rival UBS in March. Since then, investor sentiment has gradually improved, after regulators in other jurisdictions clarified that the Swiss decision to leave AT1 holders with nothing would not set a precedent for the $260bn market.  Also known as contingent convertibles, the bonds are a type of risky bank debt that can be converted into equity or written down to zero if a lender’s capital falls below a certain level. They were introduced by regulators after the 2008-09 global financial crisis to ensure that bondholders would absorb some of the losses in the event of bank failures and so shield depositors and avoid taxpayer-funded bailouts. Investor appetite for AT1 debt has recovered to levels before the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS in March, when Swiss regulator Finma angered investors by deciding to hand $3.3bn back to Credit Suisse shareholders and leave bondholders with nothing.  An iBoxx index of AT1 debt has rebounded to levels before the Credit Suisse-induced price collapse as investors were reassured by regulators elsewhere that the Swiss writedown would not set a wider precedent. The Bank of England and European Central Bank swiftly issued statements following the Credit Suisse deal affirming that shareholders would be wiped out before bondholders in a bank failure, sticking to the typical order of precedence and reassuring investors that Finma’s decision would not set a wider precedent.  According to Finma, the debt writedown was allowed because the AT1s in question contained explicit contractual language that they would be “completely written down in a ‘viability event’ in particular if extraordinary government support is granted”. At a news conference this month, Masahiko Kato, chief executive of Mizuho Bank who had taken over as the new head of the Japanese Bankers Association, stressed that AT1s issued by Japanese lenders generally do not have a similar clause, describing the wipeout of Credit Suisse bonds as “a special case”.  The sale by Sumitomo Mitsui, one of the three banks responsible for the lion’s share of Japan’s AT1 issuance, is the latest sign of a thawing in market conditions. The lender, which had already been sounding out investor appetite when the crisis at Credit Suisse erupted, said it decided to go ahead with the issuance after it confirmed a certain level of investor demand. The bank said in a regulatory filing that ¥89bn of the AT1 bonds, which cannot be called for five years and two months, would carry a coupon rate of 1.879 per cent, while ¥51bn of non-callable 10-year, two-month debt would yield 2.180 per cent. Both tranches were priced at a spread of 1.7 percentage points. SMFG previously sold ¥107bn of AT1 bonds in December in two tranches at a spread between 1.4 and 1.5 percentage points. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, however, delayed a new AT1 bond sale, planned for this month, until mid-May at the earliest.  The exposure of Japanese financial institutions to the Credit Suisse bond wipeout has been limited, but the largest hit has been Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, the group’s core securities arm, which sold about ¥95bn of the Swiss lender’s AT1s to domestic retail and corporate clients. In the wake of the AT1 turmoil last month, some banks chose not to refinance at higher costs — German specialist lenders Aareal Bank and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank decided not to call their bonds, with the latter citing “market conditions and economic costs”. Despite the broad recovery in AT1s, some are warning of a two-tier market in which Swiss debt continues to be seen as highly risky given its regulator’s impromptu decision-making.  JPMorgan analysts noted that investors should consider “a Swiss ‘legal risk premium’, not an AT1 risk premium”, adding that “damage should be relatively contained” to the Swiss AT1 market given Finma’s choice to “undermine bondholder interests and override contractual terms with ad hoc legislation”. Bonds issued in Swiss francs have not recovered as much as the wider market. A Swiss-franc denominated AT1 bond issued by UBS has recovered 3.6 per cent since lows following the Credit Suisse turmoil. One of its dollar-denominated AT1 bonds has recovered 13 per cent. The disparity highlights how investors are viewing Swiss debt. ","19.04.2023"
"Five banks broke competition law over gilts, UK watchdog provisionally finds","CMA’s initial finding shows traders exchanged sensitive information on pricing and strategies","Five of the world’s largest banks broke UK competition law by sharing sensitive information when trading British government bonds in the wake of the financial crisis, according to provisional findings from the country’s competition regulator. A small number of traders at Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada unlawfully shared sensitive information, including on pricing and strategies, in chat rooms on Bloomberg terminals between 2009 and 2013, according to the provisional finding published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday. As a result, the regulator said, the banks could have “denied the full benefits of competition” to those they were trading with, including pension funds and the UK’s Debt Management Office.  Traders swapped information “in the context of” government bond sales by the DMO and the repurchase of gilts by the Bank of England, the CMA added. “A properly functioning, competitive bond market benefits tens of millions of taxpayers and pension savers as well as being at the heart of the UK’s reputation as a global financial hub. These alleged activities are therefore very serious and warrant the detailed investigation we have undertaken,” said Michael Grenfell, director of enforcement at the CMA. The regulator said if it concluded that at least two banks engaged in anti-competitive behaviour, it might issue fines. It has the power to levy fines as high as 10 per cent of a company’s global turnover in a relevant market. There is no ongoing investigation into individual traders as part of the probe, which was opened in 2018.  “The language used here is quite punchy,” said Kate Pollock, a partner at law firm Stewarts, adding that any potential fines could be “hefty”, depending on factors such as the extent and length of misconduct.  There could also be follow-on civil lawsuits brought by investors such as pension funds, she said.  Deutsche Bank first alerted the CMA to the behaviour. As Germany’s biggest bank had admitted its involvement in “anti-competitive” activity, it will therefore not be subject to any fines. Citigroup has also admitted involvement and entered into a settlement agreement with the CMA. The Wall Street bank will receive a discounted fine if penalties are imposed, the regulator said. HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada have not admitted any wrongdoing, the CMA said, adding that its probe was ongoing and its findings were provisional. “No assumption should be made that any of the banks have broken the law,” it said.  The banks will now formally respond to the findings and the CMA will take the final decision on whether competition law has been infringed and any level of fine. Any decision could then be appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The Royal Bank of Canada said: “While we disagree with the CMA’s provisional findings, we have co-operated fully with the CMA during its investigation, and take any allegation of employee misconduct very seriously.”  Morgan Stanley said it had “co-operated fully with the CMA during this investigation and will continue to constructively engage in the process. However, we disagree with the CMA’s provisional allegations and intend to contest them.”   HSBC said it “refutes the CMA’s allegations”. It added: “We will continue to make our case to the CMA as appropriate whilst we await a final decision.” Deutsche Bank said it “proactively reported the issue to the UK authority and has co-operated fully in the subsequent investigation, which related to activity prior to 2014. As a result, we have been granted provisional immunity by the CMA and do not, therefore, expect to receive a financial penalty.” it said. Citi said: “We have co-operated fully with the CMA on this matter and are pleased to put it behind us.”  The CMA’s provisional findings follow a 2021 decision by the European Commission, which found seven banks — Bank of America, Natixis, Nomura, RBS (now NatWest), UBS, UniCredit and WestLB (now Portigon) — breached EU antitrust rules through the participation of a group of traders in a cartel in the primary and secondary market for European government bonds. Fines totalling €371mn were imposed on Nomura, UBS and UniCredit.   Pollock said Wednesday’s announcement showed that the CMA was “showing its teeth and stepping out of the shadows of the European Commission post-Brexit”.","24.05.2023"
"US and China meet in an attempt to ease tensions","The aerospace industry’s flying taxis face trouble getting off the ground","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘US and China meet in an attempt to ease tensions’ Josh Gabert-DoyonGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, June 20th, and this is your FT News Briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING]  The US and China attempt to smooth tensions. Swiss bank UBS will inherit hundreds of millions of dollars in regulatory fines. And the aerospace industry says that flying taxis could soon be on the horizon. I’m Josh Gabert-Doyon, in for Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] US secretary of state Antony Blinken has met with Chinese president Xi Jinping and other top Chinese officials as part of a long-awaited state visit to Beijing. Ties between the countries have been rocky. The US is concerned about China’s increasing military activity around Taiwan and its refusal to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Both Blinken and Xi appear keen to indicate that the two countries were now preparing for a thaw in relations. James Kynge, the FT’s global China editor, gave us a readout from the trip.  James KyngeWe need to separate the messaging that came out of the meeting from the underlying tensions that still undoubtedly exist between the US and China. On the positive side of the ledger, this is the first visit by a US secretary of state to China since 2018. So that’s a pretty big moment in itself. The other positive signalling was that both sides really seemed to praise the talks that had taken place. Xi Jinping said that progress had been made and agreement had been reached on some specific issues. He also said that China respected US interests and would not challenge or replace the United States. This type of signalling is very different from what we’ve become used to with the US-China relationship over the last several years, which is basically a situation of freefall, lurching from one crisis to another, very poor relations in terms of trade and investment. A profoundly suspicious, mutually suspicious security relationship and some big security issues such as the future of Taiwan and the US-China strategic competition around Taiwan.  Josh Gabert-DoyonDid the positive mood music surprise you?  James KyngeTo be honest, it didn’t really surprise me. This is exactly what I imagined would emerge, you know, some very measured language, diplomatic language, both sides really straining to put the relationship on to some kind of a more stable footing. But none of the really big issues being addressed, at least certainly not being communicated to the outside world as yet.   Josh Gabert-DoyonWhat do you think the real impact of this meeting is gonna be going forward?  James KyngeWe’ll really have to see whether or not the substance of the relationship changes at all. What is clear is that there are several challenges coming down the track. The Taiwan presidential elections is scheduled for January 2024. That will undoubtedly be a moment of tension between the US and China. And then the US presidential elections are in November 2024, and as we know, the run-up to any US presidential election is the time of tension for the US-China relationship, because in recent years at least, all US presidential candidates have sought to criticise China quite harshly. The other thing that is very clear is a division in what the big US corporations would like their relationship with China to be and what the administration is saying and doing. In the last few weeks we’ve had very clear representations of this. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla and Twitter, was in China recently. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, was there recently. And previous to those two, the boss of Apple, Tim Cook, was there. The way in which these corporate leaders are feted and get very superior access in China is something I think that shows the way in which China prioritises its relationship with corporate America. And I think that is, you know, one of the sources of tension between corporate America and political America that we always see being played out.  Josh Gabert-DoyonJames Kynge is the FT’s global China editor. [MUSIC PLAYING] The banking giant UBS faces a massive regulatory bill running into hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of its takeover of Credit Suisse. UBS will have to cough up the penalty because Swiss, UK and US regulators are poised to fine Credit Suisse for its mishandling of Archegos Capital. Archegos Capital, you might remember, is the family office that imploded in 2021. The FT reports that Credit Suisse had set aside only $35mn to cover the potential fines. [MUSIC PLAYING]  This week is the Paris Air Show, the world’s biggest aviation industry event. [CLIP OF A FLYING PLANE PLAYING] And that is the sound of a Boeing 777X performing an exhibition flight. But one of the displays the industry is excited about at the show is actually much quieter: flying taxis. This could be a crucial year in the development of the small, battery-powered aircraft as they prepare for early test flights. Regulators, though, may not be so keen. The FT’s Chicago correspondent, Claire Bushey, has written about the technology. She joins us now. Hey, Claire.  Claire BusheyHi, how are you?  Josh Gabert-DoyonSo what would these air taxis be used for? Would we be flying to work in them?  Claire BusheyWe would not be flying to work in them, not next year anyway. My colleague Sylvia Pfeifer and I got interested in this niche of aerospace because we wanted to get a sense of like, to what extent this is gonna change our life or not, because obviously there’s a lot of hype there. And what is being proposed right now is largely doing these routes between an urban centre and an airport. So like downtown Manhattan to Newark, New Jersey, and the company that would fly this route is saying it will take 10 minutes and cost $100 per person to make a route that in traffic takes about an hour, also takes about an hour on public transit and that will be, you know, much more efficient if you can pay $100 per seat.  Josh Gabert-DoyonSo people have been trying to build air taxis like this for a while now. What are some of those more sceptical voices saying about the future of air taxis?  Claire BusheyAmong the most scepticism is how are these actually going to fit into the national airspace? Because in the United States it’s already real crowded. We already don’t have enough air traffic controllers for the amount of planes that are going around as it is. And so the idea is that there will be corridors that these air taxis will use. But then that raises the question, OK, you’re flying over some dense areas. What if you need to divert? What if everybody needs to divert all at once? Is there enough places for people to actually land because these batteries, they can’t fly that far. And also there’s the noise issue. The manufacturers say that these will be very quiet. But there is the question, as one of the people I talked to raised of the bee versus the beehive. You don’t hear the bee, but when there’s many together, you hear the beehive, you hear the hum. And so that, too, is going to need to be addressed.  Josh Gabert-DoyonDo they think they’re gonna be able to pull it off? I mean, I know some of these companies have struggled a little bit.  Claire BusheyOf course, all these companies say they’re gonna pull it off. It’s this question of the steps on the way to real as one of the people I spoke with described it. And he compared it to when Uber launched in San Francisco with their black car service, you know, sort of this high-level service in this one city in the United States. And this service proved that the underlying concept worked. This will be like a long slog to make this part of people’s daily commute, but individual steps moving forward, like that all matters and it all sort of brings the industry forward.  Josh Gabert-DoyonClaire Bushey is the FT’s Chicago correspondent. Thanks, Claire.  Claire BusheyThanks so much.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Josh Gabert-DoyonBefore we go, Amazon has pledged to hire at least 5,000 refugees across Europe over the next three years. Dozens of other companies, including Hilton and Starbucks, are joining the initiative to mark World Refugee Day. It’s part of a growing movement towards corporate social responsibility as activist shareholders demand companies take measures to support wider societal goals. Amazon says they’ve had applicants from Ukraine, Venezuela, Syria and Turkey and that most of the roles will be in retail fulfilment and distribution.

"AT1pocalypse averted","Moving along","It seems all those quick statements from the EBA, BoE and ECB in essence slapping down Switzerland’s decision to nuke $16bn of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds have had the required effect. After a nasty Monday the Markit iBoxx Contingent Convertible index bounced back by 5.8 per cent on Tuesday. We don’t yet have data for what it did on Wednesday, but trading in Invesco’s AT1 bond ETF indicates that things were still stable.   Obviously anyone invested in junior bank debt is going to be smarting right now (and Credit Suisse’s AT1s are suing) But given the scale and abruptness of the shock, the AT1 market has actually proven surprisingly resilient. TwentyFour’s Dillon Lancaster is among the ones pleasantly surprised: AT1s fell sharply on Monday morning by between 7-15 points with higher beta names and UBS underperforming. Nonetheless, the importance of the European and the UK’s regulatory rebuttal to the weekend’s proceedings became apparent as post their respective statements, a quick rebound took place and by the end of the session roughly half of the move down had been recovered. The positive momentum has continued through yesterday and this morning with some bank AT1 bonds now back to last Friday’s prices — i.e. recovering all of the post-Credit Suisse action, but still lower than pre the US regional bank led sell off. To give a few examples, at time of writing BNP 7.375% and BARCLAYS 8.875% are two AT1 bonds to have recovered to Friday prices. Though it should be said that both bonds are still down over 10 points from their February highs and are yielding over 10% to call in sterling terms and around 10% even when priced to perpetuity. There are still names lagging, most notably UBS, and we would not be surprised to see this continue due to question marks over the Swiss regulatory regime. In addition, it appears that legal challenges could be launched from both bondholders and shareholders regarding  the Credit Suisse takeover, which could also weigh on performance, although UBS equity has performed strongly. Finally, it is worth noting that even through this period, AT1s have remained one of the most liquid instruments that we follow.The situation is still fluid and of course we are keeping a very close eye on both banking fundamentals and market moves going forward, however we have been very reassured by both the statements from the EBA and BoE and by the way the AT1 market has functioned, particularly in the wake of the regulatory rebuttal on Monday. FT Alphaville has some thoughts on whether investors really should be reassured by these statements and feel so confident that the CS AT1 wipeout is a uniquely “Swiss finish”. But they’re still a bit half-baked so bear with us.   For now though, it would be churlish to deny that a potentially nasty bout contagion triggered by the uncompromising Swiss has been quelled almost instantly by just a bit of jawboning. Which, given how dicey things have been lately, is definitely good news. Trebles all round! Further reading:— Who killed Credit Suisse?

"Credit Suisse fallout and Alibaba’s busy week","The inside story on the Asia tech trends that matter, from Nikkei Asia and the Financial Times","Hello, this is Kenji from Hong Kong, where we are in the midst of the busiest week of the annual corporate earnings season. Arguably the most-watched sector is banking, and most mainland Chinese lenders listed in the city are set to disclose their results on Thursday and Friday. They are under an especially bright spotlight this year largely due to the global financial turmoil ignited by the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank in the US. This part of the world seems to have been less impacted so far, apart from share prices being hit for certain Japanese and Hong Kong lenders and holders of AT1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse being hit with an unpleasant surprise. But our correspondent in Vietnam has found an interesting connection between one of the country’s high-profile tech companies and the troubled Swiss bank.  Another notable aspect of the Hong Kong earnings season this year is the revival of face-to-face press conferences, the first since the Covid-19 pandemic. The chairmen of China’s three state-owned telecom operators took the opportunity to express their confidence and urge investors to change how they evaluate telecom shares. Wang Chuanfu, the founder and chair of electric vehicle maker BYD, appeared in Hong Kong on Wednesday to reveal his goal of surpassing Volkswagen as the top-selling auto brand in China this year. Whether their statements bear fruit is an open question, but at least there is now an opportunity for face time with these normally aloof mainland executives. Ripple effects Asia has in many ways seemed detached from the turmoil roiling the global financial sector lately, but Nikkei Asia’s Lien Hoang in Ho Chi Minh City reports that there could be an impact on Vingroup’s planned listing of its electric vehicle arm in the US. EV maker VinFast is aiming to become the only Vietnamese company listed in the US, and it has been advised on the move by Credit Suisse among others. The question now is whether another bank will take up some of those functions after the Swiss lender’s surprise takeover by UBS. VinFast’s planned listing and its business development in the US have been closely watched as a potential landmark for Vietnamese business in the country. While the IPO filing was made last year, its first 45 SUVs only landed in the US in March after a few months of delay. Its initial plan to kick off production in North Carolina has been pushed back a year to 2025.  A Vingroup spokesperson told Nikkei Asia that the buyout by UBS “will not have a negative impact on us,” but the country’s largest conglomerate by market capitalisation is “taking all the needful steps internally while waiting for an official feedback from UBS-CS after their structuring”. Freeing up resources China has freed a top chip investor to work on bolstering its semiconductor industry as it battles US tech export controls, writes the Financial Times’ Qianer Liu and Ryan McMorrow. Chen Datong, head of Yuanhe Puhua (Suzhou) Investment, known as Hua Capital, was released following an eight-month detention, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Hua Capital is an Rmb10bn ($1.5bn) investment firm that seeded more than 150 Chinese semiconductor companies. It has been at the forefront of Beijing’s efforts to jump-start its domestic chip production. Chen was detained last August amid a storm of investigations into China’s chip industry, with officials upset that the sector has failed to nurture cutting-edge technologies after receiving tens of billions of dollars. China’s top anti-corruption agency launched multiple probes last year into the $47bn National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, China’s premier semiconductor investment vehicle known as the “Big Fund”, detaining more than a dozen top chip executives and officials. Hua Capital was one of those that received funding from the Big Fund, and Chen was an independent member of its investment committee.  Tightening US controls on access to advanced technology in recent months has forced Beijing to rethink its approach to supporting the critical sector. That consideration led to Chen’s release. Ringing the changes  Chinese president Xi Jinping’s abrupt lifting of the country’s stringent zero-Covid policy has helped fuel a sharp turnround in Chinese equities since last fall. But the three state telecom carriers — China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom — are leading the pack, helped also by Xi’s push to quicken the country’s shift to a digital economy, writes Nikkei Asia’s Kenji Kawase. Speaking at in-person earnings calls for the first time in three years, the heads of these three companies struck a confident note, emboldened by their recent share price rallies. Liu Liehong, chair and CEO of China Unicom, was the most straightforward about the change in the landscape. “Do not use an old pair of eyes to view today’s China Unicom and today’s telecommunication industry,” he urged investors. However, all three are still far from their 2007 peak share prices, when the market treated them as leading growth tech shares. Alibaba’s wild week It has been a roller-coaster ride for Alibaba Group Holding this week, events closely followed by Nikkei Asia’s Cissy Zhou. It started out with news on Monday that founder Jack Ma had returned to mainland China after nearly a year of travelling abroad. The entrepreneur and his corporate empire came under intense pressure from Chinese authorities following his speech in October 2020 openly criticising the country’s financial regulator. Ma’s return was followed the next day by China’s cyber space watchdog announcing it will kick off an official campaign against “malicious damage” done to the image and reputation of entrepreneurs. On the very same day, Alibaba announced a dramatic shake-up that will see its business empire split up into six business groups, with public listings planned for five of them. The historic governance overhaul gave its shares in New York and Hong Kong an immediate shot in the arm. But the announcement also triggered fears among its 240,000 employees of potentially substantial lay-offs, sources told Nikkei Asia.

"Credit Suisse accused of dishonest conduct by Jersey investor","Loreley Financing claims that the Swiss bank misrepresented notes that it purchased in 2007","Credit Suisse was accused of “dishonest conduct” in London’s High Court by a Jersey-based investor that claims the Swiss bank mis-sold it a complex product in the run-up to the global financial crisis. Loreley Financing made the claim on the opening day of a trial that comes less than a month after Credit Suisse was rescued by rival UBS in a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators. The trial centres on Loreley’s purchase in July 2007 of notes which it says left it with losses of $100mn. Loreley claims that Credit Suisse made false and dishonest representations which induced it to buy the notes, which were linked to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  Credit Suisse denies wrongdoing and is defending the case. Tim Lord KC, representing Loreley, told the High Court on Thursday that the investor was suing because the alleged misconduct came to light in 2017 after an investigation by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) into Credit Suisse’s securitisation of RMBS between 2005-2007.  The investigation by US authorities led to a 2017 settlement in which Credit Suisse paid a $2.48bn penalty to resolve the claims and $2.8bn in relief to consumers. Lord attacked what he claimed was the bank’s “dishonest conduct” and said admissions in the DoJ case were “the foundation for the investor complaint by Loreley”.  The DoJ settlement was like the “elephant in the room” for the bank, Lord said, adding that “when one reads this statement of facts and looks at the Credit Suisse defence, one is in a parallel universe. One is literally in an Alice in Wonderland world.” In written arguments Lord said the case “ involves a bank selling an investment opportunity which it knows to be tainted by its own wrongdoing.”  Credit Suisse, which denies the claims, said in its written arguments that the DoJ’s statement of facts “makes no reference to dishonesty, fraud, knowing misrepresentation or anything of that kind.” It added that Loreley’s claims “will not withstand careful and methodical analysis” and “fail at every level”. “As will be familiar to the Court as a regular feature of the litigation landscape, regulatory settlements of this kind have frequently resulted in litigants (and their enterprising and creative lawyers) conceiving of opportunities to leverage those settlements to attempt to claw back market losses which would otherwise be irrecoverable.” Patrick Goodall KC, acting for Credit Suisse said in his written submissions. The case is one of several unresolved legal cases in which Credit Suisse is embroiled. They could leave the bank with $5bn of litigation charges over the next four years, analysts have estimated. UBS has tried to shield itself by negotiating a loss guarantee of up to SFr9bn ($10bn) from the Swiss government as part of its takeover of Credit Suisse In the case against Loreley, Credit Suisse is also arguing that the investors claims are time-barred. However, Loreley claims it could only file a lawsuit after the DoJ’s findings in 2017.   The trial continues. ","20.04.2023"
"‘An untenable equity story’: what’s next for Credit Suisse?","The bank’s liquidity is not its fundamental problem, rather its business model is unprofitable ","The $54bn lifeline Credit Suisse negotiated from the Swiss central bank on Wednesday night was meant to act as a “circuit breaker” on the stricken lender’s woes, according to people involved in the talks. But by close of play on Thursday, the bank’s shares still traded 11 per cent below where they started the day before. The drop in its credit default swaps — a measure of investor bearishness — and bond yields was also minimal.  For investors, the bank’s liquidity is not its fundamental problem. Instead they worry its business model is unprofitable — a concern that would be exacerbated if clients continued to pull out assets.  That’s why — following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and after Credit Suisse’s biggest shareholder said it would not be increasing its investment — questions are being asked about the Swiss bank’s future. The options on the table if deposits keep being pulled include tearing up its radical restructuring plan, spinning off its Swiss unit, a full blown takeover or, in a worst-case scenario, the resolution of the bank. A current large shareholder in Credit Suisse said the central bank intervention had relieved some immediate pressure for the group, but it needed to use the time to make more profound changes. “There is a scenario where they muddle through like this and maybe it gets them through the next few months or year or two — but that’s very risky,” he said. “If any other unexpected things come along they will be vulnerable. It’s an untenable equity story.”  Muddle through or rethink Credit Suisse executives say they are intent on executing a restructuring plan, which is mean to switch capital and resources away from the lossmaking investment banking arm and towards domestic, wealth and asset management units.  But investors remain wary, especially over the lack of clarity over what exactly the bank will sell. This month the FT reported that longtime top shareholder Harris Associates had sold its entire position over the “cumbersome and far more costly” plan to hive off the investment bank. Ulrich Körner’s credibility is at stake  A change in course would represent a third strategic plan for the group in less than 18 months — and would hit the credibility of the management team and chief executive Ulrich Körner. But some board members are already starting to question whether it is needed. Break up A more drastic move would be for the Credit Suisse board to revisit a plan championed by former chief executive Tidjane Thiam and spin off the domestic universal bank. Thiam was close to listing 25 per cent of the business in 2017 but the deal was aborted after board members and investors became skittish about selling off the bank’s “crown jewel”. Tidjane Thiam wanted to spin off the domestic universal bank when he was chief executive at Credit Suisse © Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg Analysts estimate that selling off the Swiss unit could raise up to SFr15bn — nearly twice the bank’s current market value of SFr7.7bn.  The move would be a big departure from the restructuring plan, which puts the Swiss business and wealth management arm at the centre of what is referred to internally as the “new Credit Suisse”. It would also bring a de facto end to the bank’s 167 years as a national champion, dating back to its days financing Switzerland’s railways and developing its currency. There may also be some interest from rivals or other investment groups in buying the bank’s SFr402bn asset management division, which has managed to weather the storm from its damaging links to specialist finance firm Greensill Capital relatively unscathed.  Takeover In a call with several hundred JPMorgan clients on Wednesday, JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein said Credit Suisse’s most likely destiny was a takeover by its great Zurich rival UBS.  A merger between Switzerland’s two biggest banks has long been discussed internally by both boards, but the fear of hitting antitrust barriers has prevented talks from progressing. The headquarters of Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse. A merger has long been discussed by both boards © Denis Balibouse/Reuters Yet Credit Suisse’s current plight has led to speculation that the old plans could be dusted off if regulators felt it was the best way of stabilising one of the country’s most important financial institutions. Last month a person involved in UBS’s war-gaming told the FT that the bank remained on alert for a “999” emergency rescue call from the Swiss government. “The country is committed to a two-bank model, but we would be naive not to prepare for it,” they said.  Under the scenario presented by Abouhossein, if UBS did take on the business, it would IPO Credit Suisse’s Swiss business, wind down the investment bank and retain the wealth and asset management arms. But for executives at UBS, who are focusing on growing the group’s US wealth business and catching up with Wall Street bank valuations, a Credit Suisse acquisition would be too distracting. “Regulators would not want to see UBS take it on either, as it would create too much risk in one entity,” said the person involved in UBS strategy. “They would be creating something that could never be killed.” Another mooted tie-up is a takeover by Deutsche Bank. A person familiar with internal discussions at the German lender said executives would be more interested in picking up bits of the business and were not actively pursuing any deal.  Resolution If no buyer is found, the Swiss National Bank may feel it has little option but to take more drastic measures. Under one extreme scenario, the central bank could step in to guarantee the deposits, take full control of the business, sell parts off and wind the rest down. But such a move would be politically risky, given the impact on Swiss taxpayers, not to mention the ignominy of one of the country’s biggest companies being brought down. “Regulators are going to be looking very closely at whether the Credit Suisse plan is showing signs of working — if not, they will act,” said a senior executive at a rival Swiss bank. “Credit Suisse has no control over its own destiny.”  Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film  Additional reporting by Olaf Storbeck","16.03.2023"
"Credit Suisse bondholders force Swiss regulator to release AT1 wipeout decree","Decision by court gives early victory to investors in what promises to be a drawn-out fight","Credit Suisse’s bondholders have forced Switzerland’s financial regulator to divulge the decree that wiped out their investments, handing them an early victory in the legal battle to overturn the controversial writedown. Investors representing at least $4.5bn of wiped-out Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bonds filed a lawsuit against Finma last month. The suit accuses Switzerland’s banking regulator of having acted unconstitutionally when it ordered the bank to cancel the $17bn of AT1 bonds as a part of its shotgun marriage to UBS two months ago. The aggrieved investors and their law firm Quinn Emanuel had to launch their challenge largely in the dark, as Finma had kept secret the wording of its decree ordering Credit Suisse to write down their investments.   However, the judge overseeing the case, which was filed in the city of St Gallen in eastern Switzerland, ordered the financial regulator to hand over the decree last week, giving the AT1 bondholders a firmer foothold to contest the writedown. In addition to the decree that Finma issued to Credit Suisse ordering the bank to wipe out the AT1 bonds, the Swiss government issued two emergency ordinances that explicitly expanded the regulator’s powers under Swiss law to do so. The first ordinance on Thursday March 16 did not mention the AT1 bonds. But on Sunday March 19, as the rescue was finalised, officials added the line: “Finma may order the borrower and the financial group to write down additional Tier 1 capital”. The government said this gave Finma a “clearer legal basis” to wipe out the bonds. Finma has publicly said the contractual conditions were met to write down the bonds, because Credit Suisse drew on government-backed liquidity facilities in the days before its rescue by UBS.  This provoked outcry from bondholders because the AT1 bonds could only be written down if government assistance also bolstered the bank’s capital ratios, which many investors argued was not the case given Swiss authorities only intervened to aid Credit Suisse’s liquidity. A copy of Finma’s decree seen by the Financial Times states that the government-backed facilities had “a direct positive effect on the liquidity and capital situation”. The regulator added that this satisfied the so-called “viability event” clause in the bond’s documents and meant that Credit Suisse “was therefore able to write off the AT1 instruments on its own initiative”.  One bondholder said the fact that the decree explicitly sets out Finma’s interpretation of the contracts governing the AT1 bonds gives them a clearer opening to challenge the writedown. “Before it seemed like you were fighting a law, or an ordinance, which made it a constitutional fight” in which investors were less likely to prevail, he said. “Now it’s back in the realm of contracts.” The investor also argued that Finma’s reasoning that drawing on liquidity facilities also bolstered Credit Suisse’s capital was “absurd” and could have set a worrying precedent in the market for European bank capital bonds. “That a bank supervisor would say such a thing is incredible,” he added. “If every time a bank draws on central bank money it triggers their AT1s then we’d be in a real mess.” Finma declined to comment. The decree also sheds further light on the scale of the bank run that hit Credit Suisse in the days before the takeover was agreed.  Finma noted that following a run of withdrawals on the back of a crisis in US regional lenders, Credit Suisse “reached its internal cash limit with the Swiss National Bank” in mid-March and that a fall below this value risked that the bank would “no longer be able to execute its payment transactions properly”.  Credit Suisse applied to the SNB for SFr39bn in liquidity assistance on March 15, which was granted the following day. After the bank was hit with SFr14bn of outflows in a single day on March 16 and faced further withdrawals the next day, Credit Suisse applied for a further SFr20bn liquidity facility on March 17.  Then, because the “liquidity situation at [Credit Suisse] worsened despite all measures taken”, the Swiss government had to provide a “default guarantee” to enable “liquidity assistance loan” to the bank on March 19, the day of the takeover.

So is the market for additional tier 1 bonds, following Switzerland’s clumsy rescue of Credit Suisse. On Tuesday, two banks showed AT1s are no longer a no-go zone for issuers — if yields are high enough. Credit Suisse AT1s — a form of contingent convertible bonds or cocos — were wiped out when UBS was strong-armed into taking over its weaker rival. In theory, ordinary shares should have evaporated first. The risk of a repeat performance raised secondary market yields and halted issuance. Bank of Cyprus and Spain’s BBVA were the first banks to chance their arms.  The case for refinancing is clear at Bank of Cyprus. The bank was forced to bail in depositors during the 2013 eurozone crisis. It is now in better shape. It will pay its first dividend this year from a forecast return on tangible equity of 17 per cent.  This allows BoC to issue €220mn of new AT1s on better terms. It will buy in a 2018 issue of the securities. If the lender had not chosen to call or refinance the bonds, the coupon would have reset from 12.5 per cent to 15.6 per cent at the end of the year to reflect higher interest rates. The new issue, with a coupon of 11.9 per cent, reflects the bank’s improved financial outlook and stronger credit profile. BBVA has set a coupon of 8.4 per cent on its own offering of €1bn in AT1s. In the wider market, European AT1s have tracked bank share prices since March. That correlation now shows signs of breaking down. Confidence in creditor protection is returning, reversing investor losses on AT1s. There has been much debate over the status of AT1s since Switzerland cancelled $17bn of the securities to sweeten UBS’s purchase of Credit Suisse.  Disgruntled investors are bringing legal proceedings. European regulators have sought to reassure AT1 holders that the bonds remain senior to equity. Some experts warn that national officials can still invert the order.  But the more fresh AT1s that banks issue, the more the Credit Suisse debacle will seem like a one-off.

"Credit Suisse: the rise and fall of the bank that built modern Switzerland","How a national institution grew from local roots to a global force before a series of scandals sparked its fall from grace","Outside Zurich’s central station a statue of Alfred Escher looks proudly down Bahnhofstrasse, one of the world’s most expensive shopping streets, to Paradeplatz, the heart of the city’s financial district. Trains still trundle along the Swiss rail network that the 19th-century industrialist pioneered — but the bank he founded 167 years ago to finance its development is soon to be subsumed. Credit Suisse was rescued from near-bankruptcy last weekend by local rival UBS in a takeover hastily brokered by the government, sending shockwaves throughout Switzerland and global financial markets.  For more than a century and a half, Credit Suisse stood as a symbol of Swiss financial power, stability and prestige. But its fall from grace in recent years has underscored the fragility of its reputation, tarnished by a series of self-inflicted scandals. “It is shocking to lose a 167-year-old bank in 72 hours,” said Oswald Grübel, a former chief executive of both Credit Suisse and UBS, who added that the lender’s decline began after the financial crisis, from where it “went down and down and down”. John Mack, another former Credit Suisse chief executive who went on to run Morgan Stanley, has a blunter assessment of the reasons for its fall: “Their performance says it all.” Rise: The bank that transformed ‘Europe’s forgotten backwater’  Industrialist Alfred Escher set up Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, which was later rebranded as Credit Suisse, in Zurich in 1856  © Sepia Times/UIG/Getty Images Credit Suisse was born out of Escher’s determination to open up a country he lamented was “Europe’s forgotten backwater” by developing a railway network across the Alpine nation that would link northern and southern Europe. Building it required huge amounts of capital and he did not want to rely on foreign lenders, which demanded influence over the infrastructure projects they funded. So in 1856 he set up Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, which would later be rebranded as Credit Suisse. The bank’s original abbreviation, SKA, still adorns its palatial sandstone headquarters that dominate Paradeplatz.  “The Swiss success story in the 19th century is unimaginable without Credit Suisse. The magic word is railway,” said Joseph Jung, the bank’s former official historian and author of a book on Escher called Rise, Power, Tragedy — a title that could equally fit the bank he founded.  For the next century, Credit Suisse was at the centre of Switzerland’s economic growth, from helping develop its currency to financing its electrical grid. It became the go-to bank for the country’s growing middle class, before expanding in Europe and opening its first New York branch in 1940. The second world war provided the bank with both an opportunity and its first taste of international ignominy. Credit Suisse played a leading role in financing the reconstruction efforts across Europe following the conflict, although it was also accused by Holocaust survivors of blocking access to their deceased relatives’ accounts. The bank and other Swiss lenders settled a class-action lawsuit over the matter for $1.25bn in 1998. Lenders acquired by Credit Suisse were also found to have accounts linked to Nazi party officials — and for the rest of the bank’s existence it would be dogged by accusations of turning a blind eye to nefarious activities of some of its clients. In the 1960s British politicians coined the phrase “the gnomes of Zurich” to describe Swiss bankers squirrelling away pots of gold in underground caverns. For decades the country’s financiers wore the term as a badge of honour, working in an industry that prided itself on its secrecy. Credit Suisse itself built a gilt-panelled vault 18ft below the level of the nearby Lake Zurich that holds 3,500 safes for its customers.  It was not until 1978, when it struck a deal to partner with US investment bank First Boston, that Credit Suisse truly entered the global stage. Through a series of increasingly aggressive acquisitions it built up its presence in Zurich, London and New York — and became entrenched in the “bulge bracket” of global investment banks. Risky culture: How Credit Suisse lost its DNA  Credit Suisse First Boston traders sell bonds over the phone in Manhattan © Mark Peterson/Corbis/Getty Images It was at this point that the bank began to lose its way, according to Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Ethos Foundation, who traces much of the bank’s eventual risk management problems to its embrace of investment banking. “Once the bank got into capital markets and trading, it started to lose its DNA and the mentality changed,” said Kaufmann, whose foundation represents Swiss pension funds and institutional investors that own up to 5 per cent of Credit Suisse. First Boston had a more buccaneering approach to banking, with exorbitant rewards on offer for the biggest risk takers. A host of influential bankers and investors found their feet at the business, from Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, who went on to form their own boutique firm, to Richard Handler, now chief executive of Jefferies. Among other alumni is Larry Fink, the chair and CEO of BlackRock, who left First Boston in 1986 after his team made a $100mn loss on an incorrect interest rate prediction.  “There was always a cultural split between the Swiss side and the Anglo-American side. At times I thought that was productive,” said a First Boston veteran, who added the Swiss process-driven approach was complemented during times of crises by the tendency of their US and UK counterparts to challenge received wisdom.  In London in the 1980s, Credit Suisse played an influential role in the development of Canary Wharf as an alternative financial centre to the Square Mile. The idea for the new centre originated from a plan by Credit Suisse First Boston chair Michael von Clemm, who wanted to build an administrative centre on the much cheaper site. The bank’s One Cabot Square UK head office was one of the first high-rises to be built in what has since become the skyscraper-strewn Docklands. By 1990, Credit Suisse had bought a controlling stake in First Boston after the US business lost millions of dollars on the collapse of the junk bond market. First Boston’s high-risk culture pervaded through Credit Suisse’s investment bank for the next three decades. Even so, Credit Suisse fared better than most during the financial crisis. Unlike UBS, it avoided a state bailout and had much more manageable subprime losses than US rivals. However, it did rely on big investments from two Middle Eastern investors, the Olayan family of Saudi Arabia and the Qatar Investment Authority, which are still among its biggest shareholders. “When I was on the board, it was UBS that was in a crisis,” said David Syz, a former Swiss state secretary for economic affairs who served as a Credit Suisse director between 2006 and 2013. “We were quite happy that we had escaped the whole thing. But part of it, I suppose, was down to luck.” Crises: Fraud, scandals and fallouts  Credit Suisse was forced to close a $10bn group of funds tied to specialist finance firm Greensill Capital in 2021 © FT montage/Bloomberg/AFP/Getty Several current and former Credit Suisse executives and directors who spoke to the Financial Times said they believed the fact the bank survived the financial crisis relatively unscathed sowed the seeds for its eventual failure. “With hindsight, management thought it was justifying their business model and they did not need to change,” said a former director who was not on the board at the time.  While other banks were forced to clean up their act and shrink their balance sheets in the years following the crash, Credit Suisse put off dealing with legacy problems and was more willing to take risks. Its final years as an independent business have been marked by a series of scandals and heavy losses, as it lurched from one crisis to the next. The bank’s struggles over this period have been pinned on various people. But the two blamed most often are Urs Rohner — an international hurdler-turned-lawyer who chaired the bank between 2011 and 2021 when its shares lost 75 per cent of their value — and Romeo Cerutti, the bank’s general counsel for 13 years up to 2022. “There was one person in this organisation through this whole period of rot: chairman Urs Rohner,” said David Herro, chief investment officer of Harris Associates, a longtime investor in the bank that sold its entire stake this month. “But the board was not independent and strong enough to challenge him.” Rohner did not respond to a request to comment, while Cerutti declined. In the decade that followed the financial crisis, Credit Suisse brushed up with regulators over a series of financial scandals that for a long time had seemed de rigueur for global banks. It was entangled in US legal battles over subprime mortgages, had a minor role in the Malaysian 1MDB scandal and pleaded guilty to helping American citizens file fake tax returns. In one case, Credit Suisse bankers organised $1.3bn of loans for Mozambique — one of the world’s poorest countries — to develop a tuna fishing industry. But much of the money was swallowed up in kickbacks for local officials and bankers involved in the deal. In another, private banker Patrice Lescaudron defrauded some of Credit Suisse’s richest and most politically sensitive clients — including the billionaire former prime minister of Georgia — for more than a decade, using the ill-gotten gains to fund a lavish lifestyle of Rolex watches, Chanel jewellery and sports cars.  Rise and fall of Credit Suisse 1856: founding fatherIndustrialist and politician Alfred Escher wanted to modernise and elevate the Swiss economy by improving trade with Europe. He establishes Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, the forerunner to today’s Credit Suisse, to help finance a new railway system connecting Switzerland to the trade ports of Europe. The bank will play a pivotal role in Switzerland, helping to establish a single currency and the country’s electrical grid.Escher wanted to modernise and elevate the Swiss economy by improving trade with Europe 1934: swiss banking lawA flood of private wealth flows into Switzerland following the first world war after the country’s Banking Law of 1934 makes it a crime to disclose information on the activity of clients without their consent or an accepted criminal complaint. Switzerland’s banking industry becomes synonymous with secrecy, which helps boost the country’s presence on the global financial stage but has also been associated with scandal and ill-gotten gains.1988: first Boston acquisitionCredit Suisse buys a 44% stake in US investment bank First Boston after the New York-based boutique gets into difficulty from the collapse of the junk bond market. It later acquires a controlling stake in 1990, helping catapult Credit Suisse into a global investment banking powerhouse to rival Wall Street titans such as Goldman Sachs.2012-2016: TUNA bond scandalCredit Suisse bankers organise $1.3bn in loans for Mozambique — one of the world’s poorest countries — to develop a tuna fishing industry. But much of the money is swallowed up in kickbacks for local officials and bankers. In 2021 the Swiss bank pays $475mn in US and UK fines, but more damaging was the cost to Mozambique’s people, estimated at $400 per citizen — the country’s entire gross domestic product in 2016.FEB 2020: spying scandalFrench-Ivorian Tidjane Thiam is ousted as chief executive after a corporate espionage scandal threatens to destabilise the Swiss banking industry. The Swiss regulator later finds the bank had ‘serious organisational shortcomings’ and that ‘statements made by the bank to the public and to Finma subsequently proved to be partially incomplete or even inaccurate’.2021: greensill and Archegos Credit Suisse is forced to close $10bn of funds tied to collapsed specialist finance firm Greensill Capital in which it had persuaded hundreds of its wealthiest clients to invest. The Greensill scandal is followed within weeks by the collapse of family office Archegos Capital, which leaves Credit Suisse nursing further losses of $5.5bn.Jan 2022: Horta-Osório’s Covid breachesAntónio Horta-Osório resigns as Credit Suisse chair after an investigation found he had breached UK Covid rules on a trip to London to watch the Wimbledon men’s tennis final the previous summer. It is later revealed that he also attended the final of football’s European Championship at Wembley on the same day. 2023: last daysThe end comes with a controversial deal orchestrated by regulators over a frantic weekend. UBS buys the whole of Credit Suisse for SFr3bn, about SFr0.76 a share, a fraction of its tangible book value. Shareholders are denied a vote on the arrangement and the owners of $17bn of bonds are wiped out before common equity holders — reversing the capital hierarchy and upsetting market participants. Each time one of these cases came up, Credit Suisse chose to fight the claims rather than settle, which stored up trouble further down the line. By 2015 it had enlisted the highly regarded former Prudential chief Tidjane Thiam as CEO to help shake up the bank, repositioning it from investment banking under his predecessor, Brady Dougan, to its roots in wealth management. But within a few years, Thiam fell out spectacularly with his ultra-ambitious head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan, who had bought a house right next door to his boss on the shores of Lake Zurich. A neighbourly dispute over a construction project and blocked views of the lake escalated, prompting Khan to defect to UBS. But before he joined, Khan and his family were chased through the normally sedate Zurich streets by private investigators hired by Credit Suisse over concerns he was poaching staff and clients. When it was later revealed that there were other incidents of corporate espionage, Thiam’s time at Credit Suisse was up and he was ousted in early 2020. Facing oblivion  Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann, left, and his UBS counterpart Colm Kelleher, second right, speak to Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter and President Alain Berset after takeover talks last weekend © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images Next the bank turned to longtime executive Thomas Gottstein to steer the bank out of the crisis. But within a year, the wheels fell off spectacularly. In March 2021, Credit Suisse was forced to close a $10bn group of funds tied to specialist finance firm Greensill Capital, in which 1,000 of its wealthiest clients had been persuaded to invest on the promise of attractive returns for next to no risk. Smooth-talking former watermelon farmer Lex Greensill, who enlisted ex-UK prime minister David Cameron as an adviser, used the money in the funds to buy so-called receivables, a form of corporate invoice. But many turned sour, and Credit Suisse is in the middle of a fraught and expensive operation to reclaim the funds for its clients through insurance claims and lawsuits that are expected to continue for years. A few weeks later Credit Suisse was hit by a $5.5bn loss on the collapse of family office Archegos Capital — the biggest trading loss in its history. An internal report into the bank’s failings later identified a “fundamental failure of management and controls” in Credit Suisse’s investment bank and a “lackadaisical attitude towards risk”. In the immediate aftermath of the two crises, António Horta-Osório replaced Rohner as chair. The former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive promised to de-risk the lender, tackle its cultural deficiencies and trim back the investment bank. But before his plans could be put into motion, Horta-Osório was also gone. Nine months after joining the board, he fell out with board members over several issues including his breach of Covid-19 quarantine restrictions to attend both the Wimbledon men’s singles tennis final and the final of football’s European Championships in London. Among the first tasks for his successor, former UBS executive Axel Lehmann, was to deal with the fallout from Credit Suisse becoming the first Swiss bank to be charged with criminal offences in the country’s history, in a case related to its role in laundering dirty money for a group of former Bulgarian wrestlers who turned to cocaine smuggling. Although the incidents dated back more than a decade, it was yet another reminder of the bank’s laissez-faire approach to risk management and the case — with gory details of assassinations and kidnappings — was the last thing Credit Suisse wanted to be associated with.  Next up, a consortium of media outlets reported on a leaked cache of documents detailing the accounts of 30,000 Credit Suisse clients, some dating back several decades. Among the clients were family members of one-time Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, the former president of Kazakhstan and Ronald Li Fook, the former chair of the Hong Kong stock exchange who was imprisoned for taking bribes.  By summer 2022, Gottstein was gone and replaced by another former UBS executive — the phlegmatic Swiss-German Ulrich Körner. Lehmann, Körner and the rest of the Credit Suisse board spent the next three months devising a new, more urgent strategy to arrest the bank’s fortunes. Under the plan, much of the investment bank would be spun off in a contentious deal with former director Michael Klein, while the bank raised $4bn from mainly Middle Eastern investors to pay for a huge restructuring that would result in 9,000 job cuts. But by the time the new strategy was delivered in late October, the bank was crumbling under its latest crisis. This time, social media rumours about its financial health prompted clients to pull more than SFr111bn of assets from their Credit Suisse accounts — equivalent to 8 per cent of its assets under management.  Lehmann would eventually blame the bank’s demise on Twitter, but there was still time for more blunders. At the start of 2023, Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, investigated the accuracy of comments Lehmann made over the scale of the outflows, while the bank was forced to delay publication of its annual report after auditors PwC spotted “material weaknesses” in its internal controls and the US Securities and Exchange Commission demanded more information. By last week, an off-the-cuff comment by the chair of the Saudi National Bank, by now Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, about refusing to invest any more into the group — combined with jitteriness over the recent collapse of three US banks — was enough to finish the business off.  As clients withdrew $35bn in just three days last week, Swiss authorities demanded Credit Suisse be sold to UBS or face oblivion. The bank’s fate was sealed. “People were in tears both on Sunday and Monday,” said one person involved in the negotiations at Credit Suisse’s Paradeplatz headquarters over the weekend. “It was quite awful.” As for what happens next, UBS executives are already drawing up detailed plans for which parts of the business they will keep and which they will sell or wind down. “I get the tradition of Alfred Escher,” said one person involved in UBS’s deliberations. “But UBS has done the right thing for all that history, that tradition — otherwise it would be completely gone.” Additional reporting by Ivan Levingston in Zurich Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"Investors rethink risk after Credit Suisse bonds wiped out","Swiss regulator’s decision to prioritise equity over additional tier 1 debt raises questions over $260bn market  ","Investors are questioning the future of the $260bn market for additional tier 1 bank debt, following a decision by Swiss regulators to write down Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds in its rescue takeover by UBS. Last month, Swiss financial regulator Finma angered Credit Suisse bondholders by wiping out $17bn worth of the ailing bank’s AT1 debt, as part of the emergency UBS acquisition deal.  AT1 bonds are a class of debt introduced after the global financial crisis and designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble — but they are generally deemed to rank ahead of equity on a bank’s balance sheet. In the Credit Suisse rescue, however, the value of its AT1s was written down from $17bn to zero, while equity holders were allowed to receive $3.25bn.   That left the bondholders with nothing, and ranking behind shareholders — which has led some to doubt the future of the AT1 debt market and the mechanism for absorbing losses. Lawyers at Swiss law firm Jacquemoud Stanislas recently questioned the “proportionality of the Finma decision” and argued that “less invasive measures for holders of AT1 bonds could have been implemented”. Finma’s actions led to a sharp sell-off in AT1 bonds globally and, although prices have since rebounded, investors and analysts remain concerned about the ramifications of the write down for the rest of the AT1 market. Swiss debt is a particular point of concern, given the national regulator’s impromptu decision to override conventions and leave Credit Suisse AT1 holders completely wiped out. “This comes to . . . can you trust the system in Switzerland now?” says Mark Holman, partner and portfolio manager at investment firm TwentyFour Asset Management. “Some people will be saying ‘I’m not going to buy Swiss risk because I don’t trust the regulatory backdrop’.”  JPMorgan analysts have suggested that investors consider a Swiss “legal risk premium”, noting that a collapse in confidence “should be relatively contained to the Swiss AT1 market, given the proven propensity for the local regulator to undermine bondholder interests and override contractual terms with ad hoc legislation.” A Swiss problem: The debt wipeout as part of the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse has dented confidence in Swiss bonds © Denis Balibouse/Reuters Confidence in Swiss AT1 bonds certainly remains low and investors still deem them relatively unappealing. A Swiss franc-denominated UBS AT1 bond has recovered only 3 per cent in price from its recent low.   Elsewhere, however, officials have been quick to say that they would not follow Switzerland’s example if a similar situation were to occur — and would instead wipe out shareholders first. Statements to this effect from the European Central Bank and Bank of England, among others, have reassured some investors and analysts that Finma’s decision was an anomaly, and would not set a precedent for AT1s globally. Michelle Brennan, credit analyst at S&P Global Ratings, says investors now understand that other countries “may not automatically follow the Swiss pattern”. But she stresses that AT1 investors “have been reminded of their extreme vulnerability if a bank gets into trouble, and of their dependency on decisions taken by regulators and governments.” This comes to . . . can you trust the system in Switzerland nowMark Holman, partner and portfolio manager, TwentyFour Asset Management AT1 bonds were originally born out of a regulatory desire for banks to shift risk away from their depositors and on to their bondholders, and to meet higher capital requirements, thereby reducing the chances of failure. They are also sometimes referred to as contingent convertibles, or Cocos, because, as well as being written down, the bonds can be converted into equity if a bank’s capital ratio falls below a certain level.  In return for taking on these risks, banks typically reward AT1 bondholders with a higher rate of interest. And, following the Credit Suisse rescue, they are likely to have to pay more on new bond issuances. According to Brennan of S&P, “investors will demand notably higher coupon rates for new AT1 instruments” in the coming months, which may lead banks to seek cheaper funding elsewhere such as through “common equity raising . . . or else curtail balance sheet expansion”. So far, though, they have put these decisions off. Earlier this month, Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group delayed issuing new AT1 bonds planned for April until at least mid-May. Since the turmoil surrounding the takeover of Credit Suisse, no large global banks have issued any new AT1 debt.  Meanwhile, prices of existing bonds remain well below the levels seen at the start of the year.   An iBoxx index of AT1 prices is only back to where it was in March, before the Credit Suisse takeover. Similarly, an Invesco exchange-traded fund of AT1 debt has recovered only as far as its pre-acquisition price.  Global regulators are still reviewing lessons from across the banking sector. Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board, wrote to G20 ministers and central bank governors last week, acknowledging that the Swiss banking turmoil, as well as the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank in the US, had tested financial resilience.  He said the FSB would “carefully analyse recent events in order to learn from them” and that its members “stand ready to take policy measures to maintain the resilience of the global financial system”.

"Credit Suisse bondholders in uproar over $17bn debt wipeout","ECB raises concerns shareholders were prioritised over investors holding additional tier 1 debt","Credit Suisse bondholders were in uproar on Monday and the European Central Bank raised concerns after the rescue deal by rival UBS wiped out $17bn of the failed Swiss bank’s bonds, upending debt recovery norms and undermining financial market confidence. “In my eyes, this is against the law,” said Patrik Kauffmann, a fund manager at Aquila Asset Management, who invests in additional tier 1 (AT1) bank debt. He said it was “insane” that under the terms of UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse, AT1 bondholders were set to receive nothing while shareholders would walk away with SFr3bn ($3.2bn). “We’ve never seen this before. I don’t think this would be allowed to happen again.”  Davide Serra, founder and chief executive of Algebris Investments, said the move was a “policy mistake” by the Swiss authorities. “They changed the law and they have basically stolen $16bn of bonds”, he said in a widely attended call on Monday morning.  AT1s have grown into a roughly $260bn market since they were introduced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, as part of regulatory reforms that required banks to increase their capital levels.  The so-called contingent convertible securities, which are designed to absorb losses, are a relatively risky form of bank debt. They can be converted into equity if a bank’s capital ratio falls below a certain level, or investors can lose their principal entirely. The Swiss authorities’ decision to leave AT1 bondholders with nothing has turned upside down the long-established norms of debt investors being prioritised over equity holders in a debt recovery.  Jérôme Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, which holds Credit Suisse AT1s, also said that wiping out the AT1 holders was a policy mistake by Finma, the Swiss regulator. “Everyone knows that when you’re buying AT1 bonds you’re taking risks and you’re there to absorb losses. But show me the losses — there’s still SFr45bn of equity in the bank,” he said.  “Shareholders got SFr3bn and AT1 holders got nothing, which is a reversal of the usual hierarchy.” US law firm Quinn Emanuel said on Monday it was in discussions with several bondholders “representing a significant percentage of the total notional value of AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse” over possible legal action. It added that an investor call to explore “potential avenues of redress” was likely to take place on Wednesday. Investors’ complaints came despite the fact that Credit Suisse’s bond documentation made it clear that Swiss regulators could alter the traditional order in which creditors or shareholders were repaid. Finma “may not be required to follow any order of priority, which means [AT1 bonds] could be cancelled in whole or in part prior to the cancellation of any or all of [Credit Suisse’s] equity capital”, the prospectus said. Even so, other investors said reversing the market norms could herald a significant reduction in appetite for AT1s. “This could be the end of that market for the foreseeable future,” said Jim Leaviss, chief investment officer of public fixed income at M&G. “Global investors won’t be interested for a while or at least until the yields adjust significantly higher, but at that point, the yields will likely be too high for banks to want to issue them as a cheaper source of funding than equities.” The ECB questioned the Swiss authorities’ move on Monday, saying equity instruments “are the first ones to absorb losses” and only after that would AT1s need to be written down. “This approach has been consistently applied in past cases,” the ECB said, adding that AT1 debt remained “an important component of the capital structure of European banks”.  The Bank of England later said a “clear statutory order” existed for bank resolutions, namely that AT1 holders would be exposed to losses after equity investors. As the riskiest form of bank debt in Europe, AT1s typically offer higher yields than safer bonds, and are popular among professional bond investors and hedge funds, as well as retail and wealth management investors in Asia. On Friday, Goldman Sachs said the weakening in this type of debt in the previous few days represented a buying opportunity — a sign that professional analysts still saw it as a robust asset class as recently as last week. But the structure of the Credit Suisse takeover blew out that view. The “decision to write down AT1 bonds while preserving some shareholder value greatly weakens the case to add risk”, Goldman said on Sunday. Prices of risky bank debt in Europe tumbled on Monday morning as markets digested the decision. AT1s issued by other European banks were down by roughly 10 points in early trade, according to Tradeweb data. UBS bonds traded at 83 cents on the dollar, and Deutsche Bank AT1s were at roughly 63 cents on the dollar. BNP Paribas AT1s were trading at 70 cents on the dollar. An Invesco exchange traded fund tracking AT1s plunged 11 per cent on Monday morning.  Legras said the move could undermine trust in financial markets. “It’s more than a pure legal issue — it’s about market confidence and how you treat investors fairly . . . here you have the Credit Suisse exception but also the Swiss exception,” he said.  He added that Finma was more flexible than other regulators. “It would be difficult to implement in the EU or the UK.” Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","20.03.2023"

"‘Credit Suisse is part of our history’: shocked nation digests bank’s collapse","Inquest begins into how a lender regarded as a national institution could fall so fast","For most people in Switzerland, the news that Credit Suisse was to be saved from collapse by local rival UBS was met with stunned disbelief. Even the financially tuned denizens of Paradeplatz, Zurich’s banking centre, had happily gone into the weekend with no clue that the lender — regarded as a national institution — was facing an existential crisis, regardless of its recent painful travails. “I’m horrified. Just horrified,” said Roger Köppel, a politician with the rightwing Swiss Peoples’ party and editor-in-chief of weekly economic magazine Weltwoche. “It’s a catastrophe. Credit Suisse is part of our history — it’s almost as old as our history! It is the epitome of a Swiss bank.”  For Köppel and many others, serious questions must now be answered about how such an illustrious history was brought to such a sudden end. Just a week ago regulator Finma and the Swiss National Bank were confidently reassuring investors that Credit Suisse faced no issues of concern with its balance sheet or access to liquidity. But in a series of secret, government-orchestrated weekend meetings in Bern, they have forced the shotgun marriage of the bank, promised billions in guarantees to its reluctant suitor and vaporised SFr16bn ($17bn) of subordinate bonds, infuriating fixed-income investors around the world. “The fall of such a household name in Zurich is a disgrace to the Swiss financial centre and the crisis is, unfortunately, not restricted to Credit Suisse,” said Thomas Borer, a former senior Swiss diplomat, onetime Credit Suisse employee and leader of the task force that once helped Swiss banks settle their debts to Holocaust survivors.  “Decades of mismanagement in many banks  — let us not forget that UBS was saved in 2008 by the Swiss taxpayer — have not only ruined Credit Suisse but ultimately smeared the Swiss brand,” he added. “And that is what makes me angry.” Roger Köppel: ‘The way this takeover has been politically orchestrated is an attack on our rule and law-based order’ © dpa picture alliance/Alamy As soon as news of the government’s controversial deal landed — announced at a hastily convened press conference on Sunday evening and enacted using emergency enabling powers available to the cabinet — Swiss MPs began to react in shock.  An emergency recall of parliament — which had not otherwise been due to meet until May — is now on the cards, with two of the country’s four largest parties already supporting the move. Between them they have more than enough votes to trigger a special parliamentary session. Under Switzerland’s highly devolved political system, parliament is needed to ratify emergency decisions taken by the government. It is unclear how easily it will approve the raft of liquidity measures and credit guarantees Bern has promised UBS to ease its digestion of its rival. The Social Democratic party has already promised to vote for a special parliamentary inquiry to hold the banks’ and the government’s feet to the flame — and the sentiment is almost universally shared across the political spectrum. “We demand a complete account of the political responsibility,” said the party’s co-president Cedric Wermuth in an emailed statement.  “This applies to Finma, to the Swiss National Bank, and to former and current officials in the finance department,” he added, saying management at Credit Suisse had to be held “accountable and liable” for the damage they had caused.  Credit Suisse’s roots in Swiss society are deep. Its founder Alfred Escher was the Ur-Swiss patrician: a powerful businessman and government minister revered as the industrial father of Switzerland. As well as founding Credit Suisse’s forerunner, the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (the name changed in 1992), he was the creator of insurers Swiss Life and Swiss Re, and of ETH, Zurich’s world-leading university. It was Credit Suisse, meanwhile, that bankrolled Switzerland’s famous railways.  “The disappearance of Credit Suisse is also a loss to Swiss identity,” said Hans Gersbach, a professor of economics at ETH. “It was instrumental in the development of modern Switzerland to its current level of material wellbeing.”  Alan Mudie, chief investment officer of Zug-based Woodman Asset Management, who has worked in Swiss banking for the past 30 years, said “Credit Suisse played an absolutely central role in the development of the Swiss economy over the last century and a half so to see it disappear so abruptly is shocking.”  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here Some kind of deal, Mudie said, was nevertheless essential. “By the end of last week, the timeframe for Credit Suisse to turn itself around after months of problems had shrunk from years to hours,” Mudie added, noting that the speed of the resolution reflected well on the Swiss government. However, he said the decision to wipe out bondholders looks increasingly problematic. Jan-Egbert Sturm, director of the KOF Swiss economic institute, said the deal was “an important and necessary step”, adding: “what we didn’t want was another Lehman brothers — especially one triggered from Switzerland”. However, he said the issue could have been dealt with earlier. And indeed, for many, there are now questions about how the Swiss authorities allowed events to spiral so quickly and did not step in earlier to reassure the market and preserve Credit Suisse as a going concern. “If the snowball starts falling down the hill then you have a problem,” said Sturm, “and the way in which support was communicated last week wasn’t sufficient to stop the snowball from rolling.” For Köppel and the Swiss People’s party, which is supported by one in four Swiss voters, there are questions about why the government did not simply take over Credit Suisse itself, to preserve a national institution. “I’m not a protectionist, I’m a market guy, but this is a very special case,” said Köppel. “The way this takeover has been politically orchestrated is an attack on our rule and law-based order.” The SVP has publicly questioned the motivations of newly installed finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who is a nominee of the Swiss Liberals party. But even those who support Credit Suisse and its peers as institutions have little time left for the bankers who work there. Borer recalls how once Swiss politicians would visibly stand to attention, like soldiers, when the country’s illustrious bankers came to parliament. Now, the respect is gone. “The love affair is over,” said Borer, who sees fresh regulation in Switzerland as a certainty. The public is equally jaded with the bankers they once looked up to.  In the late 1970s, in an early effort at public PR, Credit Suisse gave away thousands of brightly coloured skiing hats emblazoned with its initials. As the Luzerner Zeitung, a Swiss newspaper, laconically noted this year, the hats — which now sell for more than SFr80 apiece — have been a better investment over the past half century than shares in the bank.

"Credit Suisse violated tax evasion deal, says US Senate committee","Probe reveals Swiss bank in one case failed to disclose nearly $100mn of secret offshore accounts ","Credit Suisse violated a 2014 plea deal with the US government for the Swiss bank’s role in helping wealthy Americans evade tax, according to an investigation by the Senate finance committee. The two-year probe by the committee claimed the bank — which is being taken over by rival UBS — failed to disclose nearly $100mn in secret offshore accounts belonging to a single family of US taxpayers. “At the centre of this investigation are greedy Swiss bankers and catnapping government regulators, and the result appears to be a massive, ongoing conspiracy to help ultra-wealthy US citizens to evade taxes and rip off their fellow Americans,” said Senator Ron Wyden, who chairs the committee.  Under the 2014 deal struck with the Department of Justice, Credit Suisse was fined $2.6bn, but settled for $1.3bn after agreeing to comply with disclosure rules. But in March 2021, several former Credit Suisse bankers who originally blew the whistle on their employer urged US authorities to reopen the case, stating that the tax evasion continued “well after the plea agreement and sentencing”. The release of the committee’s investigation comes less than two weeks after UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for $3.25bn in a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators in the face of a deepening crisis at the bank and wider turmoil across the banking sector.  Following the launch of the investigation, whistleblowers in 2021 informed the committee that Credit Suisse also held undeclared accounts worth nearly $100mn for a family of dual US-Latin American citizenship, according to the report. The bank “intentionally” hid the clients’ US citizenship on internal paperwork and helped them “quietly close” the accounts and transfer the assets elsewhere, the report said, citing the whistleblowers. This may lead to one of the largest penalties for violations of foreign bank account registration rules in US history, the committee said.  The 77-page report also set out Credit Suisse’s alleged efforts to help Dan Horsky, a wealthy Israeli-American economics professor conceal $220mn in offshore accounts from the government. In 2017, Horsky was sentenced to seven months in prison for tax evasion.  Staff at the Swiss bank were aware of Horsky’s potential tax compliance issues at least three years before declaring one of his accounts after being contacted by the DoJ in 2015, the report found. The report claimed that the bank worked with Horsky to remove his formal control on accounts, switching ownership to family members.  According to the report, Credit Suisse informed the committee that it had disclosed thousands of undeclared accounts worth more than $1.3bn to US authorities since its plea agreement. But in response to the committee’s inquiries, the bank found 23 additional client relationships valued at more than $20mn with potentially undeclared accounts, the report said.  As a result, the committee is “concerned that years after signing its plea agreement, Credit Suisse is still disclosing hundreds of millions of dollars in large undeclared accounts belonging to ultra-high net worth US persons in response to heightened scrutiny from Congress and DoJ”.   The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The bank’s demise does not erase its liabilities. UBS assumed those liabilities,” said Jeffrey Neiman, a lawyer representing the whistleblowers. “The failure to insist on the collection of this $1.3bn would be asking the American taxpayers to cover the cost of Credit Suisse’s bailout.” Credit Suisse has faced fines from European regulators over similar issues in recent years, including a €238mn settlement with French authorities to resolve claims that it broke anti-money laundering laws by luring wealthy clients to Switzerland.  In a statement on Wednesday following the release of the finance committee’s investigation, Credit Suisse said it “does not tolerate tax evasion. In its core, the report describes legacy issues, some from a decade ago, and we have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities.”  It added: “Credit Suisse’s new leadership team has co-operated with the committee’s inquiry and has supported the work of Senator Wyden, including in respect of suggested policy solutions to help strengthen the financial industry’s ability to detect undisclosed US persons.”","29.03.2023"
"Top ECB official claims CDS market ‘contaminates’ bank stocks and deposit flows","Sharp moves in thinly-traded credit insurance needs scrutiny, Andrea Enria says","The European Central Bank’s top supervisor has claimed “opaque” trading in credit default swaps is harming banks’ share prices and could threaten a run on deposits. Andrea Enria, chair of the ECB supervisory board, called for a review of the market after sharp moves in the prices of CDS preceded a sudden drop in the shares of Deutsche Bank and other European lenders last Friday. “With a few million you can move the CDS spread of a trillion-euro-asset bank and contaminate of course stock prices and possibly also deposit outflows,” Enria told a conference in Frankfurt. “So that is something that concerned me a lot.”  The turmoil in the banking sector has thrown the spotlight on to the market for single-name CDS, which act like insurance and pay out if a company defaults, making them closely watched as an indicator of a company’s financial strength.  Answering a question about Friday’s share price fall at Deutsche, Enria said the CDS market was “very opaque, very shallow and very illiquid”. He said there should be “more transparency” in the CDS market by shifting trading to central counterparty clearing and it should be examined by the Financial Stability Board, a global regulatory body.  “For instance, having these types of markets all centrally cleared, rather than having all these . . . opaque transactions going on somewhere, where you don’t know who is trading, I think that would already be great progress in this market,” he said. Deutsche shares fell as much as 14 per cent on Friday, prompting German chancellor Olaf Scholz to reject comparisons between the country’s biggest bank and Credit Suisse, which was forced into the arms of its rival UBS in a weekend rescue deal. Shares in Deutsche have since partially recovered, but remain down a fifth in the past month. The derivatives are thinly traded — in the final three months of last year there were on average only nine trades per day in Deutsche’s CDS even though it is one of the most traded, according to the US’s Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which runs a swaps data repository, although it is unclear how often they were traded this month. Deutsche’s five-year CDS rose from less than 100 basis points two weeks ago to more than 200 basis points by Friday, as concerns grew that the German lender may be the next to come under pressure following three US regional bank failures and Credit Suisse’s forced sale to UBS.   Hedge funds were at the same time building their bets against Deutsche’s shares. Short interest rose from less than 2 per cent to more than 3 per cent — the highest level since May — over the same period, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Marshall Wace, one of Europe’s biggest hedge fund firms, held a short position against Deutsche of 0.61 per cent of its shares as of Friday, according to a regulatory filing. “Higher CDS spreads will put widening pressure on [a company’s] bond spreads across their capital structure as well as their stock price,” said Andrea Seminara, chief executive of credit-focused asset manager Redhedge. “CDS spreads are usually correlated to a bank’s share price at times of market stress as both would reflect higher risk premium and concern on the credit quality of the bank,” he said. Credit Suisse’s CDS this month rose from less than 400 basis points to more than 1,000 basis points, reflecting worries about its financial position, shortly before it was bought by UBS.  The gross market value of single-name CDS contracts rose to $108.5bn as of mid-2022, up by more than 50 per cent from a year before, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.   It was important to continue monitoring the viability of banks’ business models, which played a part in the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, Enria said. But he denied there was a need to overhaul global banking regulation in the wake of the recent failures, adding: “We should be very careful not to throw away the baby with the bath water.”","28.03.2023"
"US boutique adviser Centerview names first co-presidents","Firm behind blockbuster deals taps new generation of leadership","Centerview Partners has named two veteran investment bankers as its first co-presidents, a move that signals the firm is positioning a new generation of leadership beyond its two prominent co-founders, Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan.  Effron and Pruzan, both aged 60, will together remain at the helm of the firm, while the newly named leaders, Tony Kim and Eric Tokat, will oversee Centerview’s advisory business and assist the founders in setting the firm’s strategy as it continues to expand. Centerview is among the most successful independent deal advisers in the US, with annual revenue peaking at roughly $1.5bn in 2021, according to people familiar with its results. This year it has been a key player in several high-profile matters including the sale of Credit Suisse to UBS and the restructuring of Silicon Valley Bank.    “Tony and Eric are world-class bankers and culture leaders for the firm, and we couldn’t be more excited for them to formally join us in pushing the firm on a journey of continued success,” Effron said. Kim and Tokat arrived at Centerview as mid-level bankers around its launch in 2006 and were eventually promoted to partners.  Kim, 48, started his career at Lazard and Wasserstein Perella. While at Wasserstein Perella he initially teamed up with Pruzan, who was a top executive there. Kim runs Centerview’s consumer-products practice and has also led internal projects related to banker recruitment and firm growth. Tokat, 46, joined Centerview in 2009 with a group from Merrill Lynch that specialised in pharmaceutical and biotech companies. He has emerged as one of the top advisers on Wall Street to up-and-coming life sciences companies. This week, his clients Prometheus Biosciences and Bellus Health, announced sales to large pharmaceuticals companies in buyouts in total valued at $13bn. Centerview now has roughly 500 total employees and around 70 partners across the US and Europe. Its senior members include the likes of Robert Rubin, the former US Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration, and Matthieu Pigasse, the French banker and media investor.  Centerview previously eschewed any formal leadership titles. Effron, previously a top banker at UBS, is a prominent figure in Democratic party circles and has long been linked to jobs in politics or public policy. Earlier in their careers both founders were best known as advisers to large consumer companies.      The promotions come amid speculation about how Centerview could seek to crystallise the value of the firm, which is likely to be several billion dollars. Rivals including Lazard, Evercore, Greenhill, Moelis, PJT Partners, Perella Weinberg and Houlihan Lokey are publicly traded. A larger financial institution could also seek to acquire Centerview to add a lucrative M&A practice. One notable competitor of Centerview, Qatalyst Partners, a firm entrenched in the Silicon Valley technology community, has remained private and independent. Its founder, Frank Quattrone, in 2016 appointed his own successor as chief executive, although Quattrone remains active in client and firm matters. First-quarter results at large Wall Street banks revealed a deep chill in the deals market, with investment banking revenue at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley falling roughly a quarter, year on year. In the first three months of the year, Centerview finished third in the global M&A league table, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.  ","21.04.2023"
"US drops rate-rigging charges against ex-Citi and UBS trader Tom Hayes","Prosecutors abandon case after appeals court overturns Libor convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders ","A New York judge has thrown out criminal charges against Tom Hayes, the former UBS and Citigroup trader who served more than five years in prison in the UK for conspiring to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate. The scandal over Libor — the London Interbank Offered Rate — sent shockwaves through global financial markets more than a decade ago. Several banks were required to pay fines for rigging the benchmark in their favour.  At issue was the way the interest rate was set, based on banks’ submissions rather than actual transactions, potentially allowing traders to push the rate higher or lower and profit from the effect on derivatives contracts.  Hayes had been accused by British and US prosecutors of being a key participant in a global conspiracy to manipulate Libor, which was used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets worldwide. The decision to drop US charges against Hayes follows an appeals court ruling in a separate US case, which overturned the Libor-rigging convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders. That ruling found the government had “failed to show that any of the trader-influenced submissions were false, fraudulent or misleading”. Prosecutors in the Hayes case said on Thursday that the previous ruling brought into question their ability to secure a conviction. Charges against another former trader, Roger Darin, were also dismissed.  Hayes was convicted in the UK in 2015 of conspiring to rig Libor and sentenced to 14 years in prison, reduced to 11 on appeal. He was released in January last year after serving five-and-a-half years and has continued to battle against the conviction. He is awaiting a final decision from the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice. Hayes was told by the CCRC it had made a provisional decision not to refer his case, but will now hear further submissions from his legal team before it makes a final decision.  Although Hayes was charged in both the US and the UK, he was only tried in the UK. If a Briton is charged by UK and overseas authorities for the same alleged wrongdoing, they are not usually extradited to face the overseas charges as well.   In a statement on Monday he said: “The US Department of Justice has seen fit to dismiss charges based on the same facts, evidence and case in law that the UK courts used to justify my 11-year prison sentence. That alone should be grounds enough for these cases to be referred back to the Court of Appeal in the UK, and if need be to the Supreme Court, which is yet to hear the case.”  Hayes has argued he was made a scapegoat for his managers and the banks themselves, who he said supported his actions.  Hayes was a star derivatives trader at UBS in Tokyo from 2006 until 2009 and claimed to have made the bank more than $280mn of profits. He was poached by Citigroup with a $4.2mn joining bonus, only then to be dismissed 10 months later as the Libor scandal accelerated.  The UK Serious Fraud Office closed its probe into rate rigging in 2019. Thirteen individuals were charged for conspiracy to defraud and four were convicted.","31.10.2022"
"Teck: market may hold Glencore to tighter coal deadline even if bid fails","Investors will enjoy surge in cash flow but coal remains a drag on Swiss group’s valuation","The planet is safe in my hands — I’m a Swiss-based commodities trader. This would appear to be the message of Glencore boss, Gary Nagle. His plan to expand the polluting coal division he has promised to divest merely adds to cognitive dissonance. For months, Glencore has been trying to nudge Teck Resources of Canada into agreeing to a takeover. On Monday, the Swiss mining and trading giant proposed an alternative: a cash acquisition of Teck’s coking coal unit, Elk Valley. This would expand Glencore’s coal ebitda by about half. It would be the second purchase of coal assets by the group in two years. This news cannot sit well with all shareholders. Witness investor restlessness with Nagle over Glencore’s climate change goals. This year about 30 per cent of votes at the annual meeting were against this, 6 percentage points more than in 2022. That is a substantial negative minority report.  That may explain why Nagle is promising to spin off all Glencore’s coal assets within two years, much earlier than expected. Coal still generates about half of Glencore’s ebitda. Adding Teck’s coal increases that dominance. The group’s paraphrase of St Augustine is: “Make me good, Lord, but not until 2025.” Investors will enjoy the temporary surge in cash flow. But coal remains a drag on the valuation of diversified miners. Shareholders said no to Teck’s independent restructuring plan because the black stuff would have funded copper and zinc divisions.  The demerger of Glencore Coal would leave the core metals business with a valuation of about 6-7 times ebitda, thinks UBS. That is well above the estimated four times for the whole group. In February, Nippon Steel agreed to buy one-tenth of Teck’s coal unit, valuing the business at $8.2bn, Glencore had put the same value on it, while Teck’s own fairness opinion valued EVR at up to $9bn, about three times expected 2024 ebitda.  Teck’s hard-nosed chair emeritus, Norman Keevil, can no doubt patiently await suitors. Mining investor Pierre Lassonde is among potential rival bidders Keevil gave Glencore the brush off when it attempted to put public pressure on him earlier this year. The alternative bid for Elk alone may founder in the same way. What it does indicate is increasing urgency within Glencore to do a deal. Investors and campaigners may now expect the company to ditch coal in two years, whatever the outcome at Teck. Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers is published twice weekly.

"Letter: Basel’s ties to Calvin made it a key Reformation city","From Matthias Stanisic, London SW1, UK","In your article “Credit Suisse and UBS investors vent anger with walnuts and song” (Report, FT Weekend, April 8), you describe Basel as “the catholic, cultural — French-facing — industrial city on the Rhine”. In fact, Basel became Protestant in 1529, and John Calvin found refuge in the city in 1535, where he subsequently wrote and published the first edition of his work on his doctrine, Institutes of the Christian Religion.  Basel is therefore an important city in the history of the Reformation and remained Protestant from 1529 to this day. While Basel did have a Prince-Bishopric, the bishop relocated to Porrentruy, in Switzerland’s Jura canton in 1529.   It is therefore incorrect to describe the city of Basel as Catholic. Conversely, it was a major intellectual hub for the Reformation in the 16th and 17th century and has been shaped by Protestantism, to which many of its great successes, cultural and economic, can be at least partly attributed.

"America’s dollar stores get a makeover for the age of inflation","No-frills retailers step up investment to attract middle-income shoppers in search of cheaper groceries","Dollar stores, the no-frills discount retailers known for catering to America’s most cash-strapped shoppers, are getting a makeover as inflation drives more demanding middle-income consumers through their doors.  The industry’s biggest chains have both announced plans to remodel almost twice as many stores as they will open this year. Dollar General and Dollar Tree will increase the number of refitted stores by 11.4 per cent and 25.6 per cent from last year, respectively.  Both are investing heavily in freezers and coolers to meet growing demand for groceries from inflation-hit customers who have shifted more spending from discretionary items to essential items like food.  The cost of remodelling and opening new stores will be considerable, marking out the chains from other retailers which are cutting costs and closing outlets. UBS analysts last week predicted that 50,000 US stores, or 5 per cent of the current total, could close by the end of 2027. Dollar General will increase capital spending by up to 22 per cent this fiscal year to as much as $1.9bn, which would be 142 per cent above what it spent in the pre-pandemic fiscal year to January 2020. Dollar Tree is increasing capital expenditure this fiscal year by about 60 per cent to $2bn, almost double what it spent in the year to February 2020.  By contrast, the far larger Walmart expects its capex to be flat or up only slightly on last year’s $16.8bn level. “They’re growing,” said Corey Tarlowe, an analyst at Jefferies. “If they’re growing, they have to spend.” UBS estimates that dollar stores have already added 12,000 outlets in the past decade, compared to just 1,100 for “big box” mass merchants such as Walmart, Target and Costco.  There are now more than 19,000 Dollar General stores and over 16,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar outlets in the US and Canada. Walmart, whose supercentres can be 10 times as large, has just over 5,700 stores in the two countries.  Dollar General and Dollar Tree had begun diversifying into groceries even before inflation began to surge. Food inflation has eased but US grocery prices were still up 8.5 per cent from a year ago in March. That pressure on household budgets has prompted shoppers who once shunned dollar stores to consider them.  “The current economic climate is driving more higher-income consumers into value retail,” Dollar Tree chief executive Richard Dreiling told analysts last month, noting that middle-income consumers, those making about $80,000 a year, were “trading down”.   Although most dollar store customers still come from lower-income brackets, middle-income consumers are playing a significant role in their grocery sales growth, a Coresight Research report found in January.   “More people are turning to dollar stores to save money, especially on everyday essentials,” echoed Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData. “As more people in middle incomes start to feel the squeeze, it becomes appealing to them as well.”  This is not the first time that economic strains have brought a new clientele to dollar stores. They saw an influx of customers during the Great Recession of late 2007 to 2009, and held on to most of them when the economy stabilised.  “They’re benefiting as they have episodically from downturns in the economy, in this case driven by inflation,” said Mark Cohen, a Columbia Business School professor. There are now more than 16,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar outlets in the US and Canada © Daniel Acker/Bloomberg To meet this spending shift, Dollar General plans to expand its food offering from 3,200 stores to more than 8,000 this fiscal year. It will install about 66,000 refrigerators, having added a similar number last year.   “Dollar General has had great success . . . on the consumer side and expanding their business into more grocery,” said Rupesh Parikh, an analyst at Oppenheimer. “I think Family Dollar is following in their footsteps.” Dollar Tree has long sold what the industry calls consumables in its Family Dollar chain but it has recently expanded its groceries offering in Dollar Tree outlets too. It started selling bread and ice last year alongside frozen and refrigerated food at $3, $4, and $5 price points, well above the $1.25 standard price it moved to in 2021 as inflation began to bite.  “Consumables drive transactions,” said Dreiling on its latest earnings call. “What we have to figure out is how to get a consumable item and a non-consumable item in the basket together and grow the basket.”   Profit margins are lower for groceries than discretionary items, so dollar stores have little incentive to push too far into supermarkets’ terrain. Dollar stores’ operating margins were more than double those of grocery chains last year, UBS noted.  “They don’t want to compete head on with Walmart,” said Saunders. “They’re a different proposition . . . what they are really is a convenience destination that allows people to buy essentials, plus a range of other things.” Instead, they can use their food business to capture market share from smaller “mom-and-pop” independent grocers, drugstores and convenience stores, Tarlowe said.  Even as they invest more heavily in existing outlets, the discount chains are still expected to outpace the rest of retail in store openings. Dollar Tree and Dollar General plan to open 650 and 1,000 new stores this year, respectively. That, analysts say, reflects another quirk of their business model.  “The dollar stores are big because they don’t really do online,” said Marie Driscoll, managing director of luxury and retail at Coresight Research. “For them to grow it’s going to be pretty much exclusively their physical footprint.”","19.04.2023"

This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning Good morning. Shares in Europe and Asia are falling today after a frantic weekend of talks to sell Credit Suisse failed to quell investors’ questions about the health of the global banking system. Shares in UBS are among the heaviest fallers after the Swiss bank agreed to buy its beleaguered rival for $3.25bn following an intervention by regulators. UBS agreed to pay about SFr0.76 a share in its own stock, up from an earlier bid of SFr0.25 that was rejected by the Credit Suisse board. The offer remains far below Credit Suisse’s closing price of SFr1.86 on Friday.  As part of the deal announced yesterday evening, Switzerland’s national bank has offered a SFr100bn liquidity line backed by a federal default guarantee. The government is also providing a loss guarantee of up to SFr9bn, but only after UBS has borne the first SFr5bn of losses on certain portfolios of assets. The combination creates one of the biggest banks in Europe. UBS has $1.1tn of total assets on its balance sheet and Credit Suisse has $575bn. But under the terms of the deal, some of Credit Suisse’s additional tier one bonds (AT1), which are designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble and to transfer the risk of a bank failure from taxpayers to investors, are being wiped out. As a result the prices of bank shares and bonds are down today across Europe. In Asia, markets fell as lenders like HSBC and Standard Chartered sunk in value and futures trading is indicating that US stock markets will also fall at the open of Wall Street today. In a sign of the growing strains in the global financial system, the Federal Reserve and five other central banks yesterday said they would switch from weekly to daily auctions of dollars from today and run the daily swaps until at least the end of next month.

"Investors snap up local currency bonds as dollar debt loses allure","Falling inflation and high interest rates in emerging markets attract investor flows","Investors are ploughing money into emerging market local currency bonds, as high interest rates and falling inflation make them increasingly attractive compared with dollar assets. In the first four months of the year, investors withdrew a net $2.65bn from funds holding so-called hard currency — predominantly dollar-denominated — emerging market bonds, but added $5.23bn to local currency bond funds, according to fund flow data provider EPFR Global. The flows mark a reversal of years of investors opting for dollar-denominated debt as a strong greenback broadly drove better and lower-risk returns. This year, the tables have turned with local bonds performing better, as currencies including the Mexican peso and Brazilian real have strengthened more than 10 per cent against the dollar.   “Local markets are far outperforming external debt,” said Paul Greer, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at Fidelity International. “Frankly I think that trend will probably continue for the rest of the year.” This year JPMorgan’s emerging market benchmark for local currency government bonds has delivered a 6.8 per cent total return, outstripping a 1.9 per cent rise for its hard currency counterpart. Analysts say much of that outperformance has been down to the fact that this year the dollar has weakened against many major developing country currencies that also offer higher rates of return. Such an uplift in return is known as “carry” in foreign exchange markets.   “The carry trade is front and centre of people’s minds,” said Manik Narain, head emerging market strategist at UBS. “There is a strong consensus to be short the dollar, on the basis of the Fed having reached the end of its tightening cycle.” Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has indicated that the central bank was preparing to hold off on another rate rise next month. However, it has been more cautious as to when rate cuts will commence. Kamakshya Trivedi, head of global foreign exchange, rates and emerging markets strategy at Goldman Sachs, said investors were still keen on the trade.  “The view being that with the Fed on pause, that should lower interest rate volatility and create some room for investors to earn the risk premium on offer in specific higher-yielding emerging market foreign exchange,” he said. While some analysts think emerging market currencies will struggle to continue to outperform the dollar, especially against a backdrop of concerns about the US debt ceiling or a US recession, many still see reasons to hold local currency bonds. “We have seen a clear divergence between emerging market local and hard currency bonds over the past few quarters with local currency debt looking more attractive on a fundamental and valuation basis,” said Thanos Papasavvas, chief investment officer at ABP Invest. Many emerging market central banks started raising their interest rates before the Fed did and were able to tame inflation quicker. For countries where interest rates remain high, that has improved the real yields on offer to investors. In Brazil, for example, the policy interest rate has been 13.75 per cent since last August while April’s inflation print showed annual price rises of 4.15 per cent. In Mexico, the policy rate rose to 11.25 per cent in April while annual inflation eased to 5.3 per cent. Added to attractive emerging market real yields, the Fed is widely thought to have finished its rate rising cycle with markets pricing in cuts of about 0.7 percentage points before the end of the year.   “Earlier hiking cycles, falling inflation and signs that the US tightening cycle has peaked have given an opportunity in emerging market debt local rates,” said Steve Ryder, a senior portfolio manager at Aviva Investors. “We like being overweight Mexican bonds both outright and versus the US as we believe the central bank is also close to its peak in interest rates, and with inflation expectations continuing to fall we believe the case for rate cuts is growing” Ryder said. Falling interest rates make bond prices rise and yields fall. Goldman picked Brazil, Hungary and Mexico as its chosen “carry candidates” and warned against the South African rand, which hit a record low against the dollar last week after the US accused South Africa of supplying arms to Russia in a covert naval operation. Nevertheless, many investors remain cautious on the outlook for emerging market assets, with positioning still low compared with historical levels.  “Confidence is very low,” said David Hauner, head of EM cross-asset strategy at Bank of America Global Research. “People are very long cash and waiting for trends to emerge.” Like Narain at UBS, he said some investors had taken an overly rosy view of the outlook for US rate cuts, which BofA did not expect to begin before next year. Even so, he said, the question was now when rather than whether the Fed would begin cutting.  “Inflows to EM local currency debt will start to accelerate when there is more confidence in the beginning of the Fed’s cutting cycle,” he said. “Everybody is waiting for that green light.”","19.05.2023"
"AI boom drives gains for chip stocks","Semiconductor index outperforms Nasdaq and hits 14-month high","Investors are gripped by a fear of missing out on chip stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, an index tracking 30 of the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturers, surged this week to its highest level in 14 months on the back of Nvidia’s blowout earnings.  The gains have sent the index up 38 per cent so far this year, far outstripping the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The latter, which includes Apple and Google parent Alphabet, has risen by a quarter over the same period.  Nvidia has led the charge because of its dominance in supplying the chips able to handle the vast computing power that can quickly create humanlike text, images and content. The US group’s market capitalisation soared by more than $184bn this week to nearly $1tn after it projected $11bn worth of sales over the next three months, nearly $4bn ahead of consensus expectations. “This is the largest raise we have seen in our coverage”, said analysts at Bank of America. But companies such as AMD, Marvell Technology and Applied Materials have also soared this year, up around 95 per cent, 70 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. “Nvidia is the clear leader, but two-thirds of [the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s] components are outperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date and more than a third are up triple the rate of the S&P 500,” noted analysts at Bespoke Investment Group in New York. Demand from institutional investors appears to have underpinned the chipmakers’ recent rally. They are the “primary source” of demand for AI stocks, with only a “marginal increase” in retail investor interest, according to VandaTrack.  Despite the hype, “the latest AI trend is still relatively small compared to the meme stock bubble” of 2021, the data provider said.  Even so, AI is the topic on many executives’ minds. A record 110 of the S&P 500 companies cited the term “AI” during their earnings call for the first quarter, according to FactSet. “The rally in AI-related companies in particular has raised concerns that this segment is now in a bubble,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. At the same time, “we don’t see the AI-related rally as unsustainable”.","28.05.2023"
"Singapore bondholders prepare to sue Switzerland over Credit Suisse","Potential lawsuit will argue the $17bn wipeout of bonds violates free trade agreement","At least 80 Credit Suisse investors in Singapore are in talks to sue the Swiss government over its decision to write down $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds on the grounds it violated a free trade agreement.  The bondholders are preparing to argue that the move breached protections against unfair state actions under the Singapore-European Free Trade Association signed with Switzerland in 2003, according to law firm Wilmer Hale, which is in talks with investors.  The potential lawsuit in Singapore would open a new front in the legal battles against Switzerland for its decision to wipe out the bonds as part of the bank’s state-sponsored takeover by UBS.  Law firms WilmerHale and Engelin Teh Practice are in talks with a group of family offices and wealthy retail investors in the Asian city state whose additional tier 1 or AT1 bonds were written off as part of the deal. Risky AT1 debt is popular in the region among retail investors. AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet. The investors so far had collectively invested close to $70mn in AT1s, enough to attract the interest of four global litigation funds, said two people familiar with the discussions, adding that the number of investors was likely to grow.  The Singapore discussions could also lead to similar actions by investors in other parts of Asia, where a large number of wealth managers, private banks and rich individuals had bought the Credit Suisse debt instruments. At least $750mn of the bonds were denominated in Singapore dollars, 91 per cent of which came from Singapore and another 7 per cent from elsewhere in Asia.  Switzerland angered bond investors when the government used an emergency ordinance to write down the bonds to zero, even as it orchestrated a deal where UBS will pay $3.25bn to shareholders. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing US bondholders who intend to fight the decision.  Unlike the US, Asian countries including Singapore, China, India, South Korea and Japan have unique protections under multilateral treaties designed to protect foreign investment, according to WilmerHale. “There are arguments that the Swiss government breached these protections by acting contrary to the investors’ legitimate expectations regarding the hierarchy of claims — that bond holders will rank higher than shareholders,” said Jonathan Lim, a partner at WilmerHale focusing on international arbitration. In contrast with the US, where big funds such as Pimco and Legg Mason were long-term holders of AT1s, Asian investors are typically smaller individuals and enterprises. The Singapore investors’ holdings ranged from $200,000 to $12mn for some of the family offices. Other lawyers cautioned that a Singapore lawsuit was an “uphill battle” and played down the chances of the investors getting their money back. “I haven’t closely assessed the merits of this approach but I would say it will be a difficult argument to win,” said one international arbitration expert. One investor, who runs a family healthcare business in Singapore, invested $500,000 of his savings in Credit Suisse AT1 bonds at the beginning of the year.   He wants the lawsuit to go ahead. “I’m not optimistic but it is better than doing nothing. I want a front-row seat to this debacle and hopefully I can learn something,” he said.  A retired entrepreneur in Singapore said they wanted to participate in the potential legal action because they felt “completely misled” over the bonds after investing $700,000 in the AT1s. “I invested because this was a household brand name. Now I have nothing.”","20.04.2023"
"BlackRock explored rival Credit Suisse takeover bid","US investment giant drew up plans to acquire part of Swiss bank","BlackRock drew up a rival bid for Credit Suisse that would trump a plan blessed by the Swiss central bank for UBS to acquire its struggling rival, five people with knowledge of the matter told the Financial Times. The US investment giant evaluated a number of options and talked to other potential investors, said people briefed about the matter. Among the options were bids for only portions of the business. However, BlackRock on Saturday said it “is not participating in any plans to acquire all or any part of Credit Suisse, and has no interest in doing so”.  Larry Fink, co-founder and chief executive of the $8.6tn money manager, was driving the bid, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Fink used to work at First Boston, Credit Suisse’s investment banking business. BlackRock was informally working with senior bankers at Perella Weinberg to explore a potential bid, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told the FT. However, BlackRock halted work on Friday because they did not see an attractive option. The firm has long been one of Credit Suisse’s biggest investment banking clients, particularly its fixed-income trading desk. A deal, especially for its US arm, would be an opportunistic way to bring trading capacity in-house, one of the people said. Any agreement would face significant regulatory hurdles in Europe and the US. The Swiss National Bank and regulator Finma favour a Swiss solution to resolve the crisis at Credit Suisse, according to people familiar with the matter. The FT reported on Friday that the SNB and Finma are orchestrating negotiations between Credit Suisse and UBS in an attempt to shore up confidence in the country’s banking sector. The pair have explored a transaction that could result in a full or partial combination between the banks.  The talks came days after the central bank was forced to provide an emergency SFr50bn ($54bn) credit line to Credit Suisse. However, this support failed to arrest a slide in the bank’s share price, which has fallen to record lows after its largest investor ruled out providing any more capital and its chair admitted that it was continuing to suffer an exodus of wealth management clients. Credit Suisse declined to comment.  Additional reporting by Laura Noonan and Brooke Masters Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","18.03.2023"
"Saudi National Bank chair resigns following Credit Suisse comments","Swiss lender’s shares fell this month after Ammar Alkhudairy’s remarks","The chair of Saudi National Bank, Ammar Alkhudairy, has resigned citing personal reasons after the kingdom’s largest lender was thrust into the limelight amid turmoil at Credit Suisse. The chief executive, Saeed Al Ghamdi, will replace Alkhudairy as chair, the bank said on Monday. Talal Al-Khereiji becomes acting chief executive. In a television interview this month, Alkhudairy said SNB, which bought a 9.9 per cent stake in Credit Suisse last year, would not provide any more financial assistance. He said buying more shares would have pushed SNB’s stake above 10 per cent and caused a “regulatory issue”.  Alkhudairy’s comments reflected established policy at the bank but sent Credit Suisse’s share price into a tailspin, setting in train frantic negotiations that culminated in a hasty merger with Swiss rival UBS. “The issue of the chairman’s statement did not go unnoticed amongst the senior decision makers,” said one Saudi Arabia-based banker. Regional executives said he had drawn undue attention to SNB and the kingdom’s broader economic agenda. The bank’s main shareholder is the sovereign Public Investment Fund, which is spearheading the reform programme of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. “It wasn’t a great idea to go on TV during the middle of a banking crisis,” said one Dubai-based banker. “There was no good outcome.” Alkhudairy is an experienced banker who used to chair the Saudi Arabian outposts of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. SNB, formed by the 2021 merger of the Samba Financial Group and National Commercial Bank, has a share of about 30 per cent of the country’s banking market. The UBS takeover of Credit Suisse resulted in about $1bn of losses for SNB, but one person with knowledge of the details said the stake in the Swiss bank accounted for less than 2 per cent of its investment portfolio and would have a negligible impact on profitability.  The rescue has caused some controversy because shareholders received a payout while holders of some bonds were wiped out, in an arrangement brokered by the Swiss authorities. The Swiss regulator has defended the deal and people close to SNB have denied pressuring for shareholder compensation. The impact of Alkhudairy’s comments on Credit Suisse’s share price reflected Saudi Arabia’s growing financial firepower. Saudi Arabia, along with other oil-rich Gulf states, have taken a more activist approach to overseas investments as they balance investment in assets that can deliver long-term returns with a growing focus on domestic economic diversification efforts. He previously described the Credit Suisse investment as a “manifestation of the new Saudi Arabia”, though he added SNB would target growth in the Middle East rather than more acquisitions in Europe. “This is the first time a Saudi bank chairman has moved global markets,” said one local analyst.","27.03.2023"
"Fidelity pushes into European corporate lending as banks retreat","Asset manager to launch fund that will make secured loans to midsized European businesses","Fidelity International is expanding into European business lending as asset managers seek to exploit gaps in the market after the financial crisis and recent banking turmoil. Fidelity, which oversees more than $700bn, is launching a fund that will make secured loans to midsized European corporates with annual earnings of around €5mn to €30mn. The private credit team will run the Luxembourg-domiciled, closed-end fund with a focus on senior debt. It aims to make its first investment in the coming weeks.   The launch comes just after BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager with more than $9tn in assets, bought private debt business Kreos Capital, which provides loans to start-ups and technology companies.  The moves by two of the world’s most prominent fund groups underscore the shift towards private credit, which has grown into a $1.4tn sector. US-based asset managers Nuveen and PGIM have also made private credit acquisitions in the past few months.  Banks pulled back from providing certain types of financing after the financial crisis in 2008 because of worries about more risky lending and tougher capital requirements. Bank lending has also been hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and the takeover of Credit Suisse by rival UBS in Europe earlier this year. “What we’ve seen with Credit Suisse and SVB is that the banks don’t have it any easier, it’s more difficult, so we see this as an opportunity,” said Nick Haaijman, global head of private asset solutions at Fidelity International.  “This is a growing market . . . Investors recognise it’s an asset class in Europe where you can see a steady income stream.” He added that the new fund will be its first in the European direct lending sector.  Michael Curtis, who will co-manage the fund, said: “Returns are looking more attractive in this market than they have done in the past few years. It’s a floating rate asset class, driven by base rate plus a margin.” The fund will also benefit from transaction fees on the underlying deals, he added. Even though the direct lending sector has grown over the past decade, Curtis said there are “far fewer participants . . . looking at mid-market corporates”. Fidelity said despite the growing number of funds in the direct lending market, there was a gap in the midsized corporate sector. According to data provider Preqin, about $125.9bn was raised by direct lending funds in 2021, and $75.9bn in the first three quarters of 2022. In Europe, $45bn was raised in 2021 and $25.7bn in the first three quarters of 2022.  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Preqin.","18.06.2023"
"US stocks advance after mixed bag of earnings","KBW Bank index adds 1.4% despite big decline in State Street shares","US stocks rose on Monday as traders weighed their concerns over a potential recession and its implications for interest rates against a mixed bag of results from the latest US banks to report their earnings. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both ended 0.3 per cent higher. The indices had declined for most of the session until pushing into positive territory in the final hour, driven by financial stocks. The KBW Bank index added 1.4 per cent, despite a 9.2 per cent decline in State Street shares after quarterly profits missed expectations, with deposits down 5 per cent in the first three months of the year. Large US banks such as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley gained 2.9 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, while Wells Fargo finished 4.2 per cent higher.  Charles Schwab — whose shares have dropped almost 40 per cent since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank — rose 3.9 per cent even after it reported an 11 per cent decline in deposits in the first quarter as clients shifted into higher-yielding accounts. Earnings per share rose more than a fifth year on year and analysts at UBS said the results as a whole were “not as ugly as feared”. Upbeat first-quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday underscored how a number of bank collapses in the US in March had benefited the biggest lenders as customers sought safety at larger names.  The yield on two-year Treasuries was up 0.09 percentage points to 4.19 per cent and the yield on 10-year debt rose 0.07 percentage points to 3.59 per cent. Yields move inversely to bond prices. Investors continue to keep an eye on the outlook for rates and expect a further quarter percentage point rise when the US Federal Reserve meets early in May with inflation at 5 per cent — far above the central bank’s 2 per cent target. Christopher Waller, a hawkish Fed governor, on Friday said monetary policy needed “to be tightened further” to cool the economy. “The labour market is still reasonably strong,” UBS analysts wrote on Monday. “Historically, the Fed has not cut rates when unemployment has been this low. As a result, we think the Fed will likely need to keep monetary policy restrictive.” The US dollar index rose 0.5 per cent against a basket of six other currencies, though it has slipped 1.3 per cent since the start of the year as traders have increased their bets that May’s expected interest rate rise will be the Fed’s last this cycle.  Across the Atlantic, Europe’s Stoxx 600 was steady, close to its highest level since February 2022. Germany’s Dax fell 0.1 per cent and London’s FTSE 100 rose by the same amount. Europe was the only big region to have had its full-year consensus earnings estimates upgraded since January, data from Morgan Stanley showed, and the bank said it did not “see this resilience breaking” as companies report their first-quarter earnings in the coming weeks.  However, the bank said it anticipated “downside risks for consensus [full-year] estimates later in the year given the prospect of slowing GDP growth, weaker margins and growing FX headwinds”. Asian stocks rallied after prices for new homes in China rose 0.5 per cent in March, the fastest pace in 21 months, and ahead of the release of the country’s first-quarter gross domestic product numbers on Tuesday.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1.7 per cent while the CSI 300, China’s benchmark of onshore-listed companies, climbed 1.4 per cent.","17.04.2023"
"Rules for winding up big banks do not work, Swiss finance minister warns","Karin Keller-Sutter says following the protocols ‘would have triggered an international financial crisis’","The global regulatory regime for “too big to fail” banks set up after the 2008 crisis does not work, according to Switzerland’s finance minister.  In an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ on Saturday, Karin Keller-Sutter — who was at the centre of Swiss authorities’ rush to rescue Credit Suisse last weekend — said following the emergency protocols that are at the centre of the regulatory architecture for big banks “would have triggered an international financial crisis”. Capital buffers and extra regulatory rules on risk have been useful for navigating times of stress, Keller-Sutter said, but in a real crisis, plans to facilitate the orderly rescue or wind-down of big banks are inadequate. “Personally I have come to the conclusion . . . that a globally active systemically important bank cannot simply be wound up according to the ‘too big to fail’ plan,” she said. “Legally this would be possible. In practice, however, the economic damage would be considerable.”  Last weekend was “clearly not the moment for experimentation”, she added in her first interview since the crisis erupted. “The crash of Credit Suisse would have dragged other banks into the abyss.” The finance minister, who took up her post at the end of December, said concerns over Credit Suisse’s liquidity had been her first question to civil servants when she started in office.  She said she asked three months ago: “When will the point be reached at which the authorities have to intervene; at which point will Finma come to the conclusion that CS is no longer viable?” Keller-Sutter sat at the centre of the emergency negotiations, representing Switzerland’s governing Federal Council and co-ordinating with the Swiss National Bank and market regulator Finma.  The eventual rescue plan, in which the bank was taken over by its bigger rival UBS, has come under intense criticism, much of it focused on the decision by Finma to wipe out SFr16bn of convertible bonds while preserving some value for Credit Suisse equity holders. Bondholders have pledged to take Swiss authorities to court in what could be a lengthy and high-profile litigative process.   Keller-Sutter did not answer questions on the decision to wipe out Credit Suisse’s subordinated debt holders, but told NZZ that the takeover by UBS was the only viable option, and the government did what it could to facilitate the deal while seeking to reduce any burden on Swiss taxpayers.  Domestically, the merger of the country’s two biggest banks — for which the government has written a SFr9bn guarantee and authorised a SFr100bn liquidity line from the SNB — has proved deeply unpopular.  A poll released on Friday showed that three-quarters of Swiss people surveyed supported legislation to break up the new entity, with a majority harbouring serious concerns that the government had overstepped its authority.

"Swiss central bank calls for overhaul of banking regulations after Credit Suisse rescue","SNB warns that dependence on regulatory capital and liquidity rules may have contributed to problems","The Swiss National Bank has called for a review of banking regulations as it warned that existing global rules on capital and liquidity do not safeguard systemically important lenders from collapse, in its first public reflections since the rescue of Credit Suisse. “The experience with Credit Suisse shows the need for a review of the Too-Big-To-Fail framework in order to facilitate early intervention,” the SNB said in its annual financial stability report, published on Thursday. The report contains a number of damning preliminary observations from the emergency rescue of Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, when it was taken over by its rival UBS in March in a government-engineered deal greased with a SFr260bn ($291bn) liquidity support package.  The SNB warns in the report that dependence on existing regulatory capital and liquidity rules may even have contributed to the bank’s problems. “The experience with Credit Suisse has shown that in a period of stress, regulatory metrics are relatively narrow and may delay corrective action,” the SNB said, The SNB, which is responsible for overseeing financial stability in Switzerland alongside the market regulator Finma, said it had identified three principal concerns.  First, it said Credit Suisse’s higher-than-required capital ratios had provided little reassurance. It also said it had concerns over exactly what was permitted to be classed as regulatory capital under existing rules, citing deferred tax assets. As the bank’s situation deteriorated, the existing accounting rules for those tax assets created a SFr2bn hole on the bank’s balance sheet, the SNB said.  Second, the SNB said additional tier 1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse — a debt instrument that has been one of the banking world’s most popular capital-raising tools in the post-2008 regulatory environment — were not fit for purpose.  The bank should have been able to wipe out the value of the AT1 bonds far earlier to improve its balance sheet, the SNB said, which was supposed to be the instruments’ regulatory purpose, but could not because the trigger point which was tied to capital ratios was an inadequate barometer of the bank’s financial health.   By the time the bonds were wiped out — in a controversial decision that has launched a ferocious legal battle in Switzerland — it was too late, the SNB said.  Third, the SNB said regulatory liquidity buffers were nowhere near adequate for Credit Suisse to cope with its situation.  “The bank’s liquidity buffers and the collateral prepared for central bank facilities were not sufficient to cover the massive liquidity outflows and the higher prepositioning requirements,” the report states.  The report proposes that in the future Swiss banks should be required to set a far higher minimum level of assets held on their balance sheet at any given time which are eligible to be pledged to the SNB as collateral for emergency liquidity lines.  The central bank is conducting a more in-depth investigation into the Credit Suisse crisis which will be delivered to Swiss parliamentarians next year. ","22.06.2023"
"Binance hid links to China","Meta executives are discussing a company-wide ban on political advertising in Europe","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Binance hid links to China’ Marc Filippino Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, March 30th, and this is your FT News Briefing.  [MUSIC PLAYING]   One of the world’s biggest online retailers is splitting itself up into six smaller companies. The world’s biggest crypto exchange says it’s got nothing to do with China anymore, but our reporter finds otherwise. And Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, is calling in a new CEO as it prepares to digest Credit Suisse. I’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Social media giant Meta is considering a ban on political ads in Europe. Meta executives are concerned that its social networking platforms like Facebook and Instagram won’t comply with European Union regulations that are in the works. The European Union is working on new laws to force big tech companies to reveal more information about the political groups behind online campaigns and which users they are targeting. Sources tell the FT that Meta is concerned that the EU’s definition of a political ad will be too broad, and that would make it easy to refuse all paid-for political campaigns on the company’s sites.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, is about to swallow its rival, Credit Suisse, in a rescue deal brokered by Swiss authorities last week. But UBS’s board decided they want a different CEO to manage the process, so they called in someone familiar. Sergio Ermotti ran UBS from 2011 to 2020. He’ll replace outgoing head Ralph Hamers. Here’s our European banking correspondent, Owen Walker.  Owen Walker Sergio was at UBS. He was CEO for nine years. And in that time he led a very successful drive to cut back the investment bank and to really refocus the business on wealth management. And that’s really what they’re looking to do again with the Credit Suisse business. So they’re looking for Sergio to come in and basically pick up where he left off and do it on a bigger scale.   Marc Filippino So, Owen, this announcement comes just a week before shareholders gather for UBS’s annual general meeting. Was that on purpose?  Owen Walker You know, shareholders didn’t get a chance to vote on this transaction. And I think although, you know, it’s been sort of fairly well-received, the takeover of Credit Suisse among UBS shareholders, I don’t think the board wanted to, you know, have another AGM and then spring another surprise on them and say, oh, by the way, we’ve just changed our CEO.  The more interesting event next week is gonna be Credit Suisse’s AGM on the Tuesday and that promises to be a very colourful, very fiery event. There’s a lot of anger in Switzerland against the management team and the board at Credit Suisse. They really see this as being, you know, a national institution which has been lost through incompetence and poor management. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter too much because, you know, in the final weeks of this being an independent business and it’ll be consumed by UBS fairly soon, but I think it’s gonna be a real sign of protest for a lot of people who are against this takeover.  Marc Filippino Owen Walker is the FT’s European banking correspondent. If you wanna hear the inside story about UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse, our sister podcast Behind the Money has a great episode on it this week. We’ll share a link to that in the show notes.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange is having a tough week. On Monday, a top US financial regulator accused Binance of illegally servicing US customers, despite the company’s claims to the contrary. And then separately, the FT’s digital assets correspondent, Scott Chipolina, reported on Binance’s extensive links to China. Scott joins us now to talk about what’s going on. Hey, Scott.   Scott Chipolina Hey, Marc. How are you?  Marc Filippino I’m doing well. So Binance claims to have left China in 2017, but you found plenty of evidence of operations there well after that time. It turns out they hid their links to China. Why is this important?  Scott Chipolina There’s a couple of reasons. First is because it reveals an inconsistency from the public statements made by Binance’s senior executives that they left China. They said that they did that after the Chinese government clamped down on the crypto industry in September 2017. Another reason why it’s particularly important today is the United States and China are obviously in the midst of a significant, you know, economic rivalry, let’s call it, for want of a better phrase. And one of the things that is central to that with regard to Binance is its US affiliate, called Binance US, is currently trying to convince American regulators to greenlight the purchase, a proposed $1bn purchase of assets belonging to an American company that went bankrupt last year. And to the extent that the US government wants to control or exert influence over the crypto industry and in essence protect its economy from Chinese influence, links to China as a country from a company that has attempted to hide those links, I think, is quite interesting.  Marc Filippino So it kind of sounds like Binance is in between a rock and a hard place. It’s up against regulators in Beijing and US regulators at the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. So let’s talk about that CFTC complaint. Scott, it alleges that Binance was illegally accessing US customers. There are some other damning accusations as well, right?  Scott Chipolina I would certainly recommend for listeners to go through the complaint itself, because it’s certainly worth a read. Just according to the complaint, in one instance in June 2020, according to the complaint, a Binance executive said in a chat message that certain customers, including some from Russia, were, and I quote directly, “here for crime”. A colleague allegedly replied, again according to the regulator, and I quote, “We see the bad, but we close two eyes.”  Marc Filippino OK. So that’s, that’s a bit of a doozy. Um. Scott, is there a link to the timing of the CFTC complaint and your report on Binance’s links to China?  Scott Chipolina No, I wouldn’t say that there is. I mean, I’ve been working on this story for a little bit, and it just so happened that, you know, it was ready this week at the same time as the CFTC complaint. So it’s, in a sense, it’s nice that they’ve both come together at the same time.  Marc Filippino So for Binance’s part, you reported that they say they’re working with regulators, they’ve invested in compliance and are disappointed with the complaint. Scott, in the end, do you think anything significant is gonna happen to Binance?  Scott Chipolina Precedent has told us that, you know, throughout an array of controversies with regulators around the world, Binance have managed to effectively just crack on. I mean, they control the majority of the crypto trading market. And just by one simple metric that’s considered, from a business perspective at the very least, a success. But I think, you know, this does, let’s say, raise the stakes somewhat. I think that the broad takeaway from the CFTC complaint is that the heat has been turned up on Binance.

[MUSIC PLAYING]  Marc Filippino Stocks in Hong Kong and China jumped this week after the Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba announced a historic restructuring. Alibaba says it will split into six separate business units. It’s the tech company’s biggest shake-up since founder Jack Ma launched his company 24 years ago.  Eleanor Olcott This is a really pivotal moment for Alibaba.  Marc Filippino That’s the FT’s China correspondent, Eleanor Olcott.  Eleanor Olcott It’s emerging out of a really bruising regulatory crackdown, which now appears to be in the back mirror, and Baba is surveying the destruction over the past two years, which has seen new and more nimble competitors enter into its core market of ecommerce, including Pinduoduo and ByteDance.  Marc Filippino So, Eleanor, what’s Alibaba trying to do with this big restructuring?  Eleanor Olcott There’s only really one thing that they can do with such a large organisation. When you’re the size of Alibaba, it’s really a margins game. It’s about improving profitability. Now Baba has a series of business units that are incredibly inefficient and lossmaking, including its entertainment and food delivery businesses. So by cleaving off the successful ecommerce units, which includes the hugely popular ecommerce platforms Taobao and the slightly more upmarket Tmall, some analysts project that this could boost the company’s valuation and return more value to shareholders.  Marc Filippino Can we assume that Chinese regulators approve of this? I mean, Beijing’s been trying to rein in these giant companies. So splitting up should actually align with that, right?  Eleanor Olcott So if you look at what’s happening at the other massive Chinese tech giant, Tencent, Tencent has been downsizing the stakes in other Chinese internet groups, including the food delivery service Meituan, in response to regulatory concern about the scale of their influence in this industry and their ability to use the massive influence of its ubiquitous WeChat messaging app to give a leg up to its portfolio of companies. There should be these kind of added benefits for Alibaba.  Marc Filippino Do you see this as a new era for China’s tech giants, Eleanor?  Eleanor Olcott We’re at a really interesting moment for Chinese internet companies. The way I see it is we’re kind of entering a third chapter of their development. The first was marked by this explosive growth, the rise of the internet economy and the explosive growth of the Chinese economy. The second chapter really started with the cancellation of the Ant IPO, and this brought in and ushered in a whole suite of regulatory actions taming these internet giants. We’re now entering a third phase when these tech giants are looking around and trying to chart a course that keeps them both on the good side of the government, while it’s also referring back to the old playbook of boosting shareholder value — something that’s been a little bit on the back burner while they’ve been fighting political battles. And it’s really in this new environment that we’re seeing changes and developments like Alibaba’s restructuring. So I think it’s the start of more to come.

"Credit Suisse/AT1s: additional tears run for conflicted Swiss officials","Executives are planning to sue regulator Finma","Bond disputes usually involve a bust-up between investors and company bosses. It is vanishingly rare for an issuer to side with disgruntled creditors. Credit Suisse nevertheless disputed the ill-judged decision of the Swiss authorities to wipe out its additional tier one securities. Swiss officials wanted UBS to take over its struggling rival. Waiving the requirement for equity to evaporate first saved the acquirer $17bn. That has imposed a heavier cost on Switzerland. It has tarnished the country’s reputation for financial reliability and lumbered it with legal disputes that will rumble for years. Unusually, EU and UK financial authorities have publicly criticised Swiss counterparts. Credit Suisse objected first, privately. It did so because at least 5,000 executives had $400mn of bonus awards reflecting the performance of the AT1s. The payouts have been cancelled. Along with a portion of AT1 holders, executives are planning to sue Swiss regulator Finma.   So-called contingent capital awards were popular with some Credit Suisse executives as, ironically, they appeared to offer more security. A semi-annual dividend provided a yearly yield of 8 per cent. The trade off was less potential for capital gains than more typical equity awards. This latest dispute is further evidence of Finma’s hastiness. The watchdog claims a “viability event” loomed, imperilling the nation’s banking system. A threat to one of the nation’s largest domestic banks could infect the whole system, it argues. This legal expropriation of AT1 capital was justified, in Finma’s view, for the sake of national needs. But in other cases — say, forcing the sale of private land for public needs — compensation is usually paid. AT1 holders have received none so far.  The chances of Credit Suisse bankers getting compensation from government coffers looks slim, at least from a political perspective. A history of reckless risk-taking by a subset of these executives was the reason clients began pulling deposits amid wider banking turmoil. However, the case undermines Switzerland’s claims that its ability to upend capital hierarchies was well-known. Even financial professionals employed by the issuer thought AT1s were safer.  Regulators are meant to set rules and police them. Evidence is growing that Finma - under heavy pressure from politicians - did just the reverse.

"Singapore asks banks to keep quiet on wealth inflows during China boom","Tacit directive from regulators comes as wealthy Chinese people funnel funds into city-state","Singapore has asked the world’s biggest banks to avoid discussing the origins of the significant sums of money flowing into the city over the past year, as wealthy Chinese funnel billions into the Asian financial hub. The tacit directive from the Monetary Authority of Singapore was given during a February 20 meeting of an industry group made up of bankers and regulators, according to multiple people who attended. The flow from China into Singapore has become a politically sensitive issue domestically, and the MAS wants banks to keep public discussion of the phenomenon to a minimum, said three people with knowledge of the talks. China was not mentioned by name, but it was clear regulators were referring to the country, they added.  The influx of mainland Chinese money and people into Singapore comes as China’s President Xi Jinping has launched a regulatory assault on business and an anti-corruption crackdown. The city-state has plotted a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, becoming a destination for the assets of many of China’s wealthiest families. “It was obvious that they [the MAS] were referring to China with all the press about family offices setting up here and mainlanders moving over, though they didn’t single out a particular country,” said one banker from an international bank. Members of the Private Banking Industry Group include HSBC, Standard Chartered, UBS, BNP Paribas, JPMorgan and Citigroup, as well as local banks DBS and Bank of Singapore. It is jointly chaired by representatives of the MAS and UBS and meets three times a year. The MAS, Singapore’s central bank, said that when banks reported the sources of their inflows, they should not single out any particular markets, according to another senior banker briefed on the discussion. This banker summarised the MAS’s message as being that private banks should “just quietly do your job” because “you don’t want to antagonise”. The MAS said the meeting in February noted that growth in fund flows into Singapore “has been driven by high net worth individuals from different regions”. The meeting also discussed “robust risk management controls to safeguard against money laundering and terrorism financing risks”, it added.  One banker said it was not the first time the MAS has used the forum to address large capital inflows from a particular market. In the past, booming Indonesian wealth — and the local scrutiny it attracted — concerned regulators. “They desperately want to be the regional hub of private banking, and the situation has kind of granted them that wish,” said the banker. “[The Chinese flows] are probably overrunning their best expectations of what was going to happen.” Lawyers and industry groups estimate Singapore had 1,500 family offices by the end of last year, with a large chunk of them from China. The MAS said there were 700 family offices at the end of 2021, up from a handful in 2018. Singapore has been eager to use financial regulation and government policy to maximise the appeal of its financial services industry and attract wealth, said one private banker briefed by a colleague on the February 20 meeting. However, it is acutely aware of the potential for domestic pushback against the influx of Chinese money and how it could widen Singapore’s income gap, already a political pressure point given the rising cost of living and soaring rents. “The Chinese presence is being felt everywhere,” said one industry group executive in the asset management industry. “It is not just super yachts and luxury cars anymore, it is being percolated down to everyday people and it is a topic of conversation across all layers of Singapore society.  “We haven’t been told explicitly not to talk about” China, the executive added, “but there is a sense in the financial services industry that talking about it publicly will not be welcomed”.","14.04.2023"
"Additional tier 1 bonds: the wiped-out debt at centre of Credit Suisse takeover","Controversy around decision has rippled across the wider $260bn AT1 market","The sale of Credit Suisse to UBS is the most dramatic moment in global banking since the financial crisis of 2007-08. It has also thrust into the spotlight the reforms that the global financial system has undergone in the past 15 years. Since the last crisis, regulators have sought to transfer more of the risk of a systemic bank failure away from depositors and on to bondholders. This was seen as a way of strengthening bank balance sheets, and avoiding contagion between banks or the need for taxpayer-funded bailouts. On the face of it, the Credit Suisse episode fulfilled that ambition. About $17bn in Credit Suisse additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds were wiped out as part of the transfer to UBS, essentially reducing the burden on its new owner and hitting investors who knew they had bought risky instruments.  But the controversy around the decision — particularly the fact that bondholders were treated more harshly than shareholders — has rippled across the wider $260bn AT1 market. It is the biggest test to date of a regulatory framework that has, until now, been mostly untested. What are AT1 bonds? When bond investors lend money to companies, they typically have a claim on the company’s assets if it cannot pay back the money. But AT1 bonds, a type of debt issued by banks, are deliberately designed so that investors’ claims disappear at times of distress. Banks must maintain certain so-called capital ratios — a measure of financial health that compares an institution’s equity capital with its risk-weighted assets. AT1 bonds are a part of the bank’s overall debt that is wiped out when the capital ratio falls below a certain level, automatically strengthening it and benefiting creditors with higher-ranking claims, such as owners of senior debt. But as well as an automatic trigger, the bonds can also be wiped out by the stroke of a regulator’s pen. This is the issue under discussion following the Credit Suisse sale. Why are some investors angry? Investors in AT1s, which have no clear maturity but can be called by the issuer, are paid relatively high returns of 6 to 7 per cent to compensate them for the risk of a writedown. In Credit Suisse’s case, the returns were even higher: the bank issued an AT1 bond at a yield of 9.75 per cent last year.  Other lenders to the bank, such as senior bondholders or depositors, receive much lower returns but are protected by the existence of AT1s and other bonds that are more exposed in the so-called creditor hierarchy, such as tier 2 debt (regulators require banks to issue various kinds of capital that are ranked by different tiers).  Even riskier than AT1s, according to the conventional understanding, is equity. Investors in equity can make much greater returns than 6 to 7 per cent if the bank performs well, but they stand to be wiped out if it performs badly or becomes worthless (which, in simple terms, would mean that the bank’s assets are not worth more than its liabilities, and so its net assets are zero).  However, shareholders were not wiped out as part of the Credit Suisse sale to UBS. This, in the words of some investors, appeared to be an “obvious breach of the hierarchy of claims” — a widespread sense that AT1 would be in the line of fire after equity. Has this happened before? Alongside requirements to issue loss-absorbing debt, regulators have also increased the power of so-called resolution authorities to make critical decisions regarding the fate of an institution at times of distress. There are so far very few precedents. The most significant is the failure of Spain’s Banco Popular in 2017. In that case, the equity was wiped out as well as the AT1 bonds. It is worth noting that in that instance, bondholders also complained of foul play and pursued unsuccessful legal action against the regulator. In this case, it is unclear whether aggrieved bondholders might have more success. The bonds’ documentation states that Finma, the Swiss authority, “may not be required to follow any order of priority, which means, among other things, that the notes could be cancelled in whole or in part prior to the cancellation of any or all of CSG’s equity capital”. Simon Adamson, at CreditSights, noted that the Credit Suisse AT1 bonds also included a clause that they could be written down in a “viability event”, which can include a situation where the bank has received “an irrevocable commitment of extraordinary support from the Public Sector”. UBS has received some backstops from the Swiss government as part of its rescue of Credit Suisse, though Adamson suggested this was “stretching the intended meaning”. What are the wider implications? The principle reflected in AT1 bonds — that bond investors should bear the risk of failure — is also applied in another part of the bank bond market. Globally systemically important banks have also needed to meet requirements to increase their total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC). In simple terms, this means that more of their liabilities will be designed to take losses in a crisis.  While the AT1 market is about $260bn in total, the world’s biggest banks were issuing $350bn to $400bn of TLAC debt annually in the three years to 2019, according to the Financial Stability Board, a global regulatory body. This market is therefore much larger, and a much more significant backstop if the health of the banking system were to deteriorate more than it already has in recent weeks. It is also a market that relies heavily on regulatory decision-making in times of crisis. The debate around the Credit Suisse AT1 debt is likely to have important implications on that front. Finally, one unexpected consequence of the invention of the AT1 market was the impact of its volatility on sentiment. In 2016, Deutsche Bank came under repeated pressure in markets because of the falling price of its AT1 debt. The bonds, which can, like equity, trade in ways not always clearly related to underlying fundamentals, have the capacity to become a crude proxy for the health of a bank. While they stand to protect against the risk of a depositor run, they may fuel the risk of other kinds of panic within financial markets themselves.

"Key measure of Japan inflation reaches highest level in 41 years","Strong ‘core-core’ price reading adds pressure on central bank over monetary policy","An important gauge of Japan’s consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in 41 years in February, increasing the challenges for the incoming central bank governor to steer monetary policy while inflation has proved stickier than expected. Continuing price pressures, combined with bigger-than-expected wage increases among large companies, have overshadowed the Bank of Japan’s forecast that inflation is not driven by underlying strong consumer demand and will slow as the cost of imported commodities falls. Analysts say the inflation readings will raise pressure on Kazuo Ueda, who takes the helm of the BoJ in April, to make a shift in the bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy and abandon its practice of holding down yields on government bonds.  The core consumer price index, excluding fresh food prices, rose at an annual rate of 3.1 per cent in February, slowing sharply from a 4.2 per cent rise in January as government subsidies to curb electricity and gas prices kicked in. The decline, which was in line with market expectations, was the first in 13 months. The so-called core-core CPI, which strips out energy and food prices but includes alcoholic beverages, rose 3.5 per cent, the fastest year-on-year increase since January 1982. Even the CPI that excludes all types of food and energy grew 2.1 per cent, exceeding the BoJ’s target. “The core-core CPI does seem stronger than expected,” said Masamichi Adachi, chief Japan economist at UBS. “The pass-through [from wholesale prices to consumer prices] that did not happen last year is now occurring.” The price pressures come after the annual shunto round of wage talks when Japan’s major companies agreed to grant an average pay rise of 3.8 per cent for the financial year that begins in April. The offer exceeded market expectations. Excluding seniority-based pay, the growth in base salaries reached 2.3 per cent, compared with 0.5 per cent a year earlier, according to trade union confederation Rengo.  While the final increase may be lower after wage talks for smaller companies, Kentaro Koyama, chief Japan economist at Deutsche Securities, wrote: “We conclude that this year’s shunto results are not just a one-time phenomenon but a vital step forward in the shift in Japan to an inflationary equilibrium.” Unlike in the US, inflation in Japan’s services sector has been weak — rising to 1.3 per cent in February — as wages have remained stagnant for most of the past three decades. The BoJ has thus argued it needs to continue its monetary easing stance until there is a transmission from rising prices to growing wages.  UBS’s Adachi said he now expected the BoJ to end its longstanding yield curve control policy in June or July. He added the central bank was likely to maintain negative interest rates in light of the turmoil in global financial markets caused by the collapse of US lender Silicon Valley Bank and the sale of Credit Suisse to Swiss rival UBS.","24.03.2023"
"US bondholders prepare to sue Swiss government over $17bn Credit Suisse wipeout","Distressed asset investor David Tepper says trust in European debt issuance at stake","US distressed debt investors and corporate litigators are preparing to fight the Swiss government over its decision to write down $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds as part of the bank’s shotgun marriage with UBS. Switzerland provoked the ire of bond investors when the government used an emergency ordinance to write down the bonds to zero, even as it orchestrated a deal where UBS will pay $3.25bn to shareholders. AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet.  “If this is left to stand, how can you trust any debt security issued in Switzerland, or for that matter wider Europe, if governments can just change laws after the fact,” David Tepper, the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management, told the Financial Times. “Contracts are made to be honoured.” Tepper is among the most successful investors in troubled financial companies, famously making billions of dollars on a 2009 wager that US banks would not be nationalised during the last financial crisis. Appaloosa had bought a range of Credit Suisse’s senior and junior debt as the bank descended into chaos. Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay, which held Credit Suisse AT1 bonds, said Switzerland was “looking more like a banana republic”. His Financial Capital Bond fund is down 12.2 per cent this month. Some funds have been buying exposure to the debt in preparation for the legal battle. Goldman Sachs is one of the banks facilitating claims trading and has offered prices at single-digit cents on the dollar. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing bondholders, with Quinn hosting a call on Wednesday joined by more than 750 participants.  Quinn partner Richard East told the FT the deal was “a resolution dressed up as a merger” and pointed to statements by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which distanced themselves from the Swiss approach.   “You know something has gone wrong when other regulators come and politely point out that in a resolution [they] would have respected ordinary priorities,” he added. Quinn is eyeing lawsuits in multiple countries, according to lawyers at the firm. Potential avenues include challenges to the actions of the regulator Finma on the basis of a violation of investors’ property rights or an arbitrary exercise of discretion. The firm is also looking into whether Credit Suisse could be liable for mis-selling over statements made to investors, including in an investor presentation in March. Pallas Partners also held a call with potential clients on Wednesday afternoon. Natasha Harrison, the firm’s founding partner, said there was “a very good argument that misrepresentations and misstatements have been made about the financial safety of Credit Suisse as recently as 14 March”. Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds started to plunge last week after its largest investor ruled out providing more capital and wealthy clients withdrew SFr35bn ($38bn) in deposits. Global distressed funds saw an opportunity and bought some of the riskiest debt, gambling that the government would not let its second-largest lender collapse and would instead arrange a merger with its rival, UBS.  While the terms of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds warned that Swiss regulators “may not be required to follow any order of priority”, several investors and analysts have argued that the contractual conditions for writing down the bonds were not met. Usually, AT1s can only be triggered if a “viability event” occurs, described in the prospectus as when “customary measures” to improve the bank’s capital adequacy are “inadequate or unfeasible” or the institution receives “an irrevocable commitment of extraordinary support from the public sector” to prop up its capital level. The Swiss government said last week that a law change had given it a “clearer legal basis” to wipe out the bonds. Pimco, Invesco, BlueBay and Legg Mason are among the longer-term holders of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds. Värde Partners, a prominent alternative credit investor founded in Minnesota, had a small position in AT1 bonds going into the fateful weekend, said a person familiar with the matter, though a broader position in senior Credit Suisse debt made its overall trade profitable. Funds run by Algebris Investments, Lazard and GAM are among fund managers that have been hit hard by a wider sell-off in AT1 debt. AT1s fell as much as 19.5 per cent in the month to the end of Monday, according to an iBoxx index of such debt, although they have since recovered some ground.  Lazard Capital Fi fund, which invests in AT1s including Credit Suisse, lost 9 per cent on Monday, taking losses this month to 17.3 per cent.

"Buyers look beyond big-name resorts to get around Swiss restrictions","‘I’d never heard of Grimentz but it’s beautifully preserved and feels like it’s at the end of the world’","Aware of the restrictions on second homes in Swiss ski resorts, Fran and Bill Keillor from Texas decided to fast-forward their dream of buying a new-build home in the Alps last year. A decade since the Swiss voted to ban the construction of new second homes in areas where they already account for more than 20 per cent of accommodation, most of the big resorts have already hit that threshold or built out the new developments. So to find what they were looking for — a roomy, five-bedroom apartment — they would need to look at smaller resorts, where schemes permitted before the ban were still available. The couple found a duplex in Grimentz, a pretty ski village of ancient sun-blackened chalets and barns in the Valais canton last spring. “We had never heard of Grimentz but fell in love with it and realised there was the opportunity to get a brand-new home,” says Fran, a retired dietitian. “Skiing is our big passion and with three of our four children based in the UK, Europe made sense”.  The diminishing number of new second homes has forced developers into finding ways to work around the Lex Weber rules — and buyers to look beyond the big-name resorts. The lack of supply has helped push up prices. The price of a Swiss Alpine second home rose by an average of 9 per cent in the 12 months to the fourth quarter of 2022, says Claudio Saputelli, head of real estate at UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Office. “A buying frenzy was fuelled by the coronavirus-induced demand for living in nature, asset inflation and ultra-low mortgage costs,” he says.  Crans-Montana, in the Valais canton © AsiaDreamPhoto/Alamy Mortgage costs have risen since. After increases in the Swiss interest rate since September, rates for long-term fixed-rate deals are around 2.5-3 per cent. Levels of lending are dropping, according to Saputelli, but it hasn’t stopped people buying. “Interest rates are still historically low and the imbalance — caused by Lex Weber — between supply and demand will still remain going forward.” It’s long been virtually impossible to buy or build anything new in ski villages with strict local restrictions, such as Zermatt, St Moritz and Wengen, but communes are finding ways to increase their supply of second homes, says Simon Malster of Investors in Property, an estate agency. “Two exemptions to the Lex Weber are new touristic classified schemes that have hotel-style facilities with an obligation to rent out your home when you are not using it; and old hotels that are no longer economically viable being refurbished as apartments that can be sold as second homes,” he says. An example of the latter is The Residence du Glacier in the centre of Saas-Fee, a traditional ski village near the Italian border, where 21 apartments are selling from SFr1.05mn (€1.06mn) for three bedrooms.  There are also new schemes (without a rental obligation) that were approved before Lex Weber. Les Flocons du Neige, in Grimentz, has recently completed 11 apartments with prices from SFr750,000; and there are two four-bedroom chalets left at Le Dégères Chalets, a six-home development, priced from SFr3.065mn.  For a couple of the very last schemes to be completed in the popular Four Valleys you need to look to its smaller villages: the Dixence Resort in Les Collons or the hamlet of Les Masses close by. Kevin Dijkers, a wind turbine developer turned impact investor from Utrecht in the Netherlands, bought a six-bedroom chalet in Grimentz last summer. “I’d never heard of Grimentz — there aren’t many Dutch there — but it’s beautifully preserved and feels like it’s at the end of the world,” he says. “For a long-term investment for my grandchildren, I thought a high-altitude Swiss resort the best option [to protect against the warming climate].” Skiing in Grimentz goes up to 2,900m, and the area is linked to neighbour Zinal. “With four children and their partners, the family and our friends will find time to use it as much as possible.” You clearly pay a premium for a second home in Switzerland. But with the precarious state of the banking system I just want to put my money into property asap.” The Keillors purchased in Les Chalets d’Adélaïde, designed by Comina Architecture with 15 chalets and 50 apartments on the south side of the main piste. “It put the little-known resort on the radar,” says Giles Gale of Alpine Property Finders. “But 10 years in the building, it took a while for sales to get going.” With an average price of SFr10,000 per sq m, Grimentz is the 23rd most expensive Alpine resort, according to UBS. The most expensive is St Moritz, at SFr21,000, followed by Gstaad at SFr17,000, both also in Switzerland. It was the “prohibitive” cost of second homes in St Moritz and Verbier (average price SFr14,900 per sq m) that took Graham, from Buckinghamshire, on his third trip to the resort of Crans-Montana last month. After seeing 10 properties within his SFr2mn budget, he’s just reserved a three-bedroom apartment in the Valais town famed for its glitzy shops and for hosting the Omega European Masters golf tournament every summer.   “I found a resale apartment that needs work for under my budget,” says Graham, a father of three, who prefers not to use his full name. “You clearly do pay a premium for a second home in Switzerland. But with the precarious state of the banking system I just want to put my money into property asap.” The average sale price in “Crans” is SFr10,200 per sq m, according to UBS. Crans-Montana hosts the Omega European Masters golf tournament in summer  Graham didn’t want to wait for the off-plan schemes of Les Champs de Poudreuse (new piste-side flats with planning permission before Lex Weber) and Résidence de la Poste — 15 apartments due to complete in 2024 from SFr954,275. Way above his budget, although available to buy now, are the private residences at the piste-side Six Senses Crans-Montana that just opened this month, where prices start at SFr6mn. State of the art wellness facilities on offer include dog massages and facials for SFr50.  Outside of the new schemes, you can wait until an existing second home comes up for sale, and these are available, says Cassandra Levene of Alpine Homes. “We have a ‘red list’ of three [British] owners desperate to sell for financial reasons, with five such sales last year,” she says, referring to properties in Crans-Montana and the Four Valleys. The agency’s most active buyers are Swiss. High-octane Verbier remains as requested as ever, but you’ll be looking at a handful of resale apartments or chalets, according to Alex Koch de Gooreynd, head of Knight Frank’s Swiss desk. Andermatt, in the Uri canton, is an exception to Lex Weber and has new second homes to buy © Valentin Luthiger There are instances of properties built pre-Weber Law being converted by their Swiss owners from “first home” to “second home” status with the payment of a tax to the local commune (such as 10 per cent of its market value). “This helps the locals make their property saleable to a wider market,” says Malster. Homes sold in this way attract an average premium of about 15 per cent, according to UBS. A major exception to Lex Weber is Andermatt Swiss Alps in Uri canton, a traditional ski village revamped into a modern resort now managed by the American operator Vail Resorts. All its new apartments are available as second homes without a rental obligation, prices from SFr1.3mn. On whether buying elsewhere in the Alps might be a lot easier, Fran Keillor says that she does not like purpose-built French resorts. Graham shares her sentiment: “I couldn’t find anything I wanted in Italy, my first choice, and Austrian resorts are too low. Switzerland is a much better bet,” he thinks.

"The inside story of Credit Suisse’s collapse, by Credit Suisse","Dispatches from the room where nothing was happening","Who better to walk you through the banking sector’s March madness and offer their thoughts on systemic financial stress than… Credit Suisse? Notes from the bank analysis team at CS have come admirably thick and fast, even after their employer collapsed and was subsequently folded into rival UBS last month. But there’s a rather large Swiss elephant in the room: the bank’s otherwise thorough analysis of the panic that began at Silicon Valley Bank and prompted its own demise awkwardly omits any mention of one major player: itself.   Addendum: Yes we know they’d be restricted about writing about their own bank, but it shows the difficulty of covering a crisis your own employer is in or near the centre of. Lehman vets will sympathise. Anyway, below is a timeline of the analysts’ notes — best read to the tune of Nearer, My God, to Thee.  March 10: Two days after SVB launched a $2.25bn share sale to cover a large loss on its bond portfolio, all was seemingly well with the world. “Eurozone deposit beta remains low at the start of the year”, Credit Suisse cheerily noted: European [net interest income] momentum continues to be strong, with customer spreads +10bp in January from +8bp in December. January deposit margins are 18bp higher in the Eurozone (led by Ireland, Portugal, and Spain), and 14bp in the UK despite recent peak NIM debates. Given higher deposit rates, margins were slightly lower in Norway and Sweden. In the Eurozone, deposit rates went up most (margins increased least) in Austria and Belgium. March 13: Life moves pretty fast, especially on weekends, something Credit Suisse would find out the hard way later in the month. SVB had by Monday been shut down by regulators, with contagion fears wiping billions of dollars off the market value of even the biggest US banks. Analysts at CS did not appear overly concerned: European banks closed 4% lower on Friday after US banks were 8% lower on Thursday and 4% lower on Friday following events around SVB. We see direct read across as limited to our listed European universe. [High quality liquid asset] is near EUR 5tn with median [liquidity cover ratio] and [net stable funding ratio] of 145% and 120%. More broadly on the deposit debate, European deposits are still growing adjusted for seasonality.…Unrealised bond loss concern is overdone: While higher rates can create unrealised losses in AC debt portfolios, this is only an issue if there is a catalyst to realise those losses through funding outflows. European banks have debt securities at amortised cost slightly above their [common equity tier 1] capital at a median 4% of assets, with the rest already marked to market in equity. March 15: Trouble a-brewing. A day earlier, Credit Suisse (the company itself) said it had identified “material weaknesses” in its internal controls over financial reporting, sending its shares down 4 per cent and the spread on its five-year credit default swaps up to a record 522 basis points.  SVB’s collapse had meanwhile sparked a full-blown panic — the kind that can bring down even healthy-looking banks, let alone those softened up by years of crisis.  The, uh, Credit Suisse research verdict? Meh, it’ll probably be fine — its analysts either ignoring or precluded from mentioning (maybe by a conflict of interest, or because Swiss banks aren’t on the Euro Stoxx banks index) their employer’s own worrying CDS spike: We do not see SVB itself being a systemic risk especially now that there appears to be a de facto guarantee on all deposits of troubled banks and President Biden’s commitment to do ‘whatever is needed’ to protect deposits. While the [three-month forward rate agreement/overnight index swap rate]  spread (a signal of stress) has widened sharply (but is a long way away from GFC levels), senior banks’ CDS spreads in Europe and the US do not signal major stress. We view these as a better reflection of systemic risk. March 16: Asked whether the Saudi National Bank would consider extending extra capital to Credit Suisse if needed, (now ex-)SNB chair Ammar Alkhudairy delivered what now looks to have been the killer blow. “The answer is absolutely not,” he told Bloomberg. Cue pandemonium everywhere…  …except the Credit Suisse banks strategy desk: Post SVB, we expect investor risk appetite and fundraising momentum to remain subdued for longer…SVB, Signature Bank and Silvergate have had a significant impact on securities market levels and volatility, and market interest rate expectations. Whilst longer-term impacts are not yet clear, we highlight three potential outcomes: i) More volatility and derivatives trading and clearing volumes – benefiting DB1 and LSEG, ii) Reduced investor risk appetite – with a greater focus on liquidity and risk, and iii) Reaching peak NIM sooner. March 17: Shares in CS rallied after the Swiss National Bank agreed to do what the Saudis had hours earlier ruled out, extending a $54bn liquidity lifeline to shore up confidence.  As Bryce pointed out at the time, CS’s liquidity coverage ratio “even before taking account of the backstop… was 150 per cent — which is not great, but not justification to panic either.” Not that CS analysts were ever worried: This time market concerns are interest rate risk and liquidity, rather than credit risk. Our Monday report highlighted the low level of duration risk in European banks’ bond portfolio. We also see the banks in our coverage tending to be larger players in their own markets, and likely to move with system trends where European deposits are still growing. We see the most tangible impact on banks’ earnings from the week’s events being changes in policy rate expectations.  With central bank funding secured, its shares recovering and a crisis surely averted, Credit Suisse’s analysts seemingly took a well-earned week off.  March 24: Apart from UBS agreeing a $3.25bn deal to buy Credit Suisse on March 19, potentially averting a global economic meltdown, nothing much happened while the analysts were away. Back at their desks, they got back to work on the big questions of the day: The weakness in US office REITs due to refi challenges has led to a renewed focus on Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposures of banks… March 29: Fresh from being wiped out in the shotgun marriage with UBS, Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bondholders were by now in uproar. Take a few deep breaths and remember it could easily be worse, CS’s analysts soothed: We reduced European banks to a marginal overweight in our 2023 outlook but critically prefer banks to non-financial cyclicals (where we are underweight). Banks in the US have underperformed by 28% (the normal bear market sees underperformance of 42%) — in Europe, we think for good reasons, banks have underperformed by only 10% (cf a historical bear market norm of 35% underperformance). March 31: A note on fast-approaching first-quarter earnings seemed a nice way to round off a month marked by a mysterious bout of “renewed volatility”. Most banks have suggested at conferences during Q1 that while activity is likely to be down on prior year, volatility has been good for business. ","24.04.2023"
"Letter: Credit Suisse exposure, an investor’s worst nightmare","From Colin Clunie, Head of Emea Operations, Clearwater Analytics, Edinburgh, UK ","Robin Wigglesworth identifies that the biggest losers in the Credit Suisse collapse are those who were holding the bank’s additional Tier 1 bonds and I can’t disagree (“Credit Suisse AT1s vaporised”, FT Alphaville, FT.com, March 19). What must now be uppermost in investors’ minds is the heightened requirement to have an in-depth understanding of their own risk exposures. I’m sure that when the news of UBS and Credit Suisse’s forced union broke, many an investor was thinking: “Am I exposed to this in any way?” Investors are likely to be exposed to these banks in more complex ways than previously (say in 2008), be that through very niche bonds, complex and often opaque derivative products, or some other form of credit.  When you invest in a wide range of assets, you are often dealing with very different types of data in your internal systems, and having the ability to quickly pull up a very clear and transparent view of all of your holdings isn’t as common as you’d expect. What the events of the last month have re-emphasised is the importance of real time, daily, validated and reconciled pricing data on investors’ whole portfolios, so that they can properly understand their exposure to what they may have thought last week were rock solid assets.

"WisdomTree faces revolt by largest shareholder","Tensions rise in dispute over strategy at US ETF manager ","WisdomTree’s biggest shareholder is attempting to seize control of the board of the $90.7bn US asset manager with the aim of ousting both the chief executive and chair in an increasingly acrimonious dispute over strategy.  Jonathan Steinberg, WisdomTree’s founder and chief executive, is planning to launch a blockchain-enabled digital assets platform this year but his plans are opposed by Graham Tuckwell, the largest shareholder, who argued that the company should focus on its core fund management business and on improving its operational performance. Tuckwell, the driving force behind the creation of the world’s first gold exchange traded fund, has nominated himself for election to the board along with Bruce Aust, a former vice-chair at Nasdaq, the exchange operator, and Tonia Pankopf, managing partner at Pareto Advisors, an investment management consultant.  Six board seats are due to be voted at the annual shareholder meeting in June including the positions held by Steinberg and Frank Salerno, WisdomTree’s chair since 2019. Steinberg remains convinced that adopting blockchain-enabled technology is key to the future success of the company which he founded as an investment magazine publisher in 1988 before overseeing its development into an ETF provider in 2006.  He has insisted that the investment made in developing the new WisdomTree Prime platform has not detracted from the company’s core ETF business which attracted net investor inflows of $12.2bn last year. That strong momentum has continued in the first quarter with net inflows reaching $6.3bn, pushing assets under management to a record high. Steinberg told the FT in 2018 that he expected WisdomTree’s assets to reach $100bn without specifying a timeframe, a goal that is now within view. UBS this week upgraded WisdomTree to “buy” and raised its 12-month share price target from $6 to $8 to reflect the manager’s “consistently strong” net inflows. It closed at $6.25 on Wednesday, up 14.8 per cent so far this year. “Investors appear to understate WisdomTree’s value as a standalone franchise,” said Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS in New York.  Speaking to the FT last year, Steinberg said he was acutely aware that his leadership was under attack.  “I was taught to win with honour, lose with honour and to never cheat,” he said, a riposte that underlines the acrimony between himself and Tuckwell. The dispute has been rumbling since WisdomTree acquired the European arm of ETF Securities, a London-based ETF specialist founded by Tuckwell in 2005, in a $611mn cash and shares deal in November 2017. Both men believed that the deal would help the enlarged WisdomTree, then ranked as the world’s ninth-largest ETF manager, to compete more effectively with bigger rivals such as BlackRock and Vanguard. They also hoped the combination would enhance WisdomTree’s appeal to a potential acquirer. However, no buyer for the group appeared and the share price has fallen by about 38 per cent since the completion of the deal in April 2018.  Tuckwell, an Australian entrepreneur, said WisdomTree needed to focus on its core ETF business and that overhauling the board was necessary to address the “dismal” share price performance. Tuckwell has also been infuriated by WisdomTree’s reinstatement of a complex “stockholder rights plan” — involving the issue of preference shares that lack voting rights — designed to block him from gaining control without having to pay a premium.  WisdomTree’s board has “repeatedly refused to have any meaningful dialogue or make any offer or proposal that might assist in reaching any form of settlement”, said Tuckwell. He has also objected to WisdomTree’s decision to approve the expansion of its severance plan to include eight executives who together could collect up to an estimated $25mn if their contracts are terminated. Steinberg could walk away with an estimated $9mn under the severance plan, according to an adviser to Tuckwell. Salerno, WisdomTree’s chair, said Tuckwell was “asking for a blank cheque” to change the board to suit his own personal agenda.  “Contrary to Mr Tuckwell’s misleading claims, WisdomTree’s strategy is clearly leading to strong performance results,” he said.

"Letter: Swiss central bank has put its independence at risk","From Jacob Bjorheim, Visiting Fellow, University of Zurich, Switzerland ","Like a gravitational pull, the takeover of Credit Suisse by its bigger rival UBS has attracted press coverage on an unprecedented scale (“How the Swiss orchestrated a rescue”, The Big Read, March 21). In all this, one aspect of the “rescue package” has slipped through the cracks unnoticed: the fact the Swiss National Bank, Switzerland’s central bank, has lost its independence.  According to the Swiss Central Bank Act, the SNB is not permitted to seek or accept instructions either from the federal council or from the federal assembly. By demanding and accepting a loss guarantee from the federal council on a SFr100bn liquidity assistance loan (the “public liquidity backstop”) for the combined new bank, the SNB has violated this principle.   It is time to define who is responsible for fulfilling the monetary policy mandate and who stands accountable for the stability of Switzerland’s financial system. While the former is clear, the latter is now firmly in the hands of the federal council.  Jacob Bjorheim Visiting Fellow, University of Zurich,Switzerland ","24.03.2023"
"HSBC exit a sign of Canary Wharf’s post-pandemic woes","Bank’s departure is latest blow to the east London financial district that rose in the wake of Thatcher’s ‘Big Bang’ reforms","For more than two decades, 8 Canada Square, the London skyscraper that houses HSBC’s global headquarters and bears its logo, has been a symbol of Canary Wharf’s status as a global financial centre. But the bank’s decision to ditch the city’s east-end Docklands in favour of a more central location reflects the business district’s waning allure to finance companies after a transformative shift in working habits. “It is another blow to a part of London that has been hit disproportionately hard since the pandemic began,” said Mark Stansfield, senior director at commercial real estate data provider CoStar. “Many of the large banks based here are cutting their office footprints.”  With the future of another landmark tenant, Credit Suisse, in flux following its near collapse and rescue by rival UBS this year, Canary Wharf’s reputation as a hub for global banking has been cast into doubt. The tower-strewn neighbourhood, developed in the wake of Margaret Thatcher’s 1986 Big Bang financial reforms, has often battled with a perception of being too sterile and far removed from London’s more vibrant areas. Now more desirable districts in the capital are competing on office space as demand for large buildings dwindles.  HSBC told staff on Monday that it expected to leave Canary Wharf in late 2026, preferably for Panorama St Paul’s in the City of London, a building that was formerly an office for telecoms group BT. Several other banks, such as Barclays, Citigroup and Société Générale, have been consolidating their operations in Canary Wharf, closing ancillary offices and subletting floors.  Marcus Phayre-Mudge, a property fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said Canary Wharf’s woes were in part the result of its historic over-dependence on financial services tenants. Big banks’ space requirements have declined since the area was developed during the 1980s boom of computer trading. They have since adopted new technology and flatter screens, while bankers who typically work long hours have embraced the remote working practices that became the norm during the pandemic. By contrast, central areas such as the West End are home to more diverse sectors such as tech, retail and fashion.  More than 1mn square feet of extra space have become available on the market in the Docklands area since the pandemic struck, according to CoStar. Analysts say the London office space market has split, with strong demand for top-tier buildings that boast sustainable credentials and slumping interest for others. “Lots of firms are downsizing so the City is more attractive,” said Capital Economics senior economist Matthew Pointon, highlighting the historic financial district’s better transport links and proximity to cultural institutions and restaurants. “If you’re downsizing you probably get more valuable space in the City.” Some expect HSBC’s departure to trigger a wider exodus that will benefit central London’s property sector. James Neville, a partner at property consultancy Allsop, said HSBC’s decision was “fantastic” news for central London developers. He expects more companies to snap up “pre-lets” at a premium, with supply for top-tier central buildings still tight.  The Docklands has one of the highest office vacancy rates in London at 15.5 per cent, according to CoStar, against as little as 3 per cent in some parts of the West End and a central London average of 9 per cent. Credit Suisse was one of the first big banks to move to Canary Wharf, taking up the 21-storey One Cabot Square building in 1991. The building underwent an expensive revamp just before Covid hit, with executive floors spruced up.  But successive rounds of job cuts at the bank in recent years have meant many of the floors are currently unused. Executives at the bank had already begun reassessing its global property footprint, including Cabot Square, before its rescue by rival UBS. The takeover, which completed this month, is expected to lead to thousands of job cuts in London, with possible implications for its future in Canary Wharf. French lender SocGen is another bank that invested heavily in its Canary Wharf UK headquarters when it moved into seven floors of the 27-storey One Bank Street skyscraper in 2019, but the bank has since sublet some of the space in response to an increase in homeworking. Barclays last year moved its investment banking staff out of 5 North Colonnade — one of two buildings it occupied in Canary Wharf — and consolidated its workforce in One Churchill Place, the 32-storey skyscraper that was opened in 2005. Citigroup is also in the process of bringing all its 10,500 Canary Wharf staff under one roof. The Wall Street lender bought the 200-metre high, 42-storey tower at 25 Canada Square for £1.2bn in 2019 as part of a global strategy to own, not rent, its major office buildings to save costs. The bank’s global hybrid working policy — where staff can work up to two days from home — has meant it will no longer require its two other Canary Wharf offices after the refurbishment is complete, which is expected to be in 2025. Citigroup’s investment in refitting 25 Canada Square was seen as an endorsement of the area, as was Morgan Stanley’s decision to commit to its office after it scouted around for alternative potential bases over the past two years. In a further sign of support for the Docklands, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development relocated staff in the Square Mile to the top 13 floors it has leased in the 26-storey Five Bank Street. Rating agency Moody’s downgraded the debt of Canary Wharf Investment Holdings in May citing a “difficult operating and funding environment for real estate companies”. Its report also cited Canary Wharf’s £1.4bn of debt that needs to be refinanced in 2024 and 2025 as a contributing factor in the downgrade.  Clifford Chance, the last major law firm in Canary Wharf, is set to move in 2028 to a “net zero carbon” City of London office in Aldermanbury Square, to the north-east of St Paul’s Cathedral, that is less than half the size of its current home. Both Clifford Chance and HSBC said sustainability had been a strong pull factor in their decision to move to new buildings, while analysts say companies are looking to take advantage of the end of their leases to find more energy-efficient buildings that can help them meet their net zero commitments. “A lot of [the Canary Wharf] towers were built 15, 20 years ago,” said Phayre-Mudge. “They are well maintained but there are of course new ways of heating and cooling which were not used back then.” Canary Wharf was also recently hit by a high-profile insolvency after 5 Churchill Place, a 12-storey building owned by Chinese property developer Cheung Kei Group that was once home to Bear Stearns, collapsed into administration last month. Canary Wharf Group was bought in 2015 by Canadian private equity firm Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority in a £2.6bn deal and has sought to reduce its dependence on financial services tenants under their ownership.  The group has committed to building what it claims will be “Europe’s biggest life sciences campus” on the estate, having attracted tenants such as Genomics England, the Barts Health NHS Trust and start-ups in the sector. It also opened a 40,000 sq ft life science lab. The area’s residential offering has also grown in recent years, with more than 3,500 people now living on the estate, compared with none three years ago. The company is developing an affordable housing scheme for people who earn less than £60,000 a year, as well as infrastructure including a school to service the residential community.  At the end of 2022, 54 per cent of the estate’s tenants were linked to financial services, according to Canary Wharf’s annual report. “Wherever possible steps are still taken to mitigate or avoid material consequences from this concentration,” the report said.  But given the industry’s dominance of the area, shifting to a substantively different occupancy mix will be tricky. “What is going to happen to Canary Wharf is the conversation everybody’s been having,” said Neville. “There are other avenues [than office space] they are having to look at but with the sheer size of the space that’s going to be a challenge.” Letter in response to this report: Canary Wharf should follow New York’s example / From Ross Freedman, London W1G, UK","27.06.2023"
"Citigroup loses top London-based dealmaker","Alison Harding-Jones, who runs M&A business in Europe, Middle East and Africa, to depart in March","Citigroup is losing one of its most senior dealmakers, with Alison Harding-Jones, the head of its M&A business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, set to depart at the end of next month, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Harding-Jones has run the US bank’s M&A operations in the region since 2017, when Citi poached her from UBS as it sought to bolster its European business. She also holds the title of vice-chair of corporate and investment banking for the region. She has advised on deals including Philip Morris International’s acquisition of the smokeless tobacco company Swedish Match, and the £4bn purchase of UK department store Selfridges by Thai conglomerate Central Group and Austrian group Signa in 2021.  Her departure comes as a slowdown in dealmaking activity hits investment banks around the world. Mergers and acquisitions fell by a record amount during the second half of 2022, as an economic slowdown and higher interest rates ended a period of frenetic activity. Worldwide, investment banks’ fees from M&A activity fell 26 per cent to $35bn last year. Harding-Jones declined to comment. “Alison will be missed for her energy, charismatic style, and her complete focus on delivering for our clients and our teams,” Citi said in a memo to staff on Monday confirming the departure. It is not clear what Harding-Jones’s next move will be.  Alison Harding-Jones  The senior executive previously spent 28 years at UBS, including leading its Asia-Pacific M&A business based in Hong Kong. She is one of the few prominent female dealmakers at Citigroup. Citigroup has recently brought in Jens Welter, a top dealmaker from Credit Suisse, as co-head of European investment banking and chair of its consumer and retail advisory business.  The bank lost Alberto Verme, a senior investment banker whose clients ranged from Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, after he died this month at the age of 65. Citi’s chief executive Jane Fraser said in a note to employees that London-based Verme was “a true titan of our industry and a selfless mentor to many of us”.

"Sanofi/Provention: innovative diabetes drug is a good fit","French pharma group needs new assets after trial failure of cancer treatment amcenestrant","After last year’s slump, biotech M&A has surged this year. The companies best placed to replenish Big Pharma’s pipeline have attracted premium prices. US diabetes drugmaker Provention Bio is a case in point. Sanofi has bought it for $2.9bn in cash, more than three times its undisturbed price, in a deal that closed last week. The deal is a good fit for Sanofi, even though boss Paul Hudson pulled back from diabetes research in 2019. He judged none of its projects innovative enough to secure high prices from cash-strapped health systems. That is not the case for New Jersey-based Provention’s Tzield, which is the first of its kind. It can delay onset of the clinical stage of type 1 diabetes by several years. Analysts expect peak US sales to reach $1bn — and potentially double that if approved to treat people who already have the disease.  It is not a stretch for Sanofi, with a net debt-to-ebitda ratio of 0.6 according to S&P Capital IQ. It had enough financial muscle to bid for rare disease specialist Horizon, which was ultimately sold to Amgen for $26bn last December. Its interest in Horizon was unusual. Provention is far more typical of the small science-centred deals that Hudson has favoured. There have been 10 totalling $16.8bn since 2019.   As well as the diabetes drug, Provention has therapies for lupus and coeliac disease that are at an early stage of development. Sanofi needs new assets after disappointments such as the trial failure of cancer drug hope amcenestrant last August. To be sure, asthma and eczema drug Dupixent goes from strength to strength. A recent trial of its use in lung disease posted impressive results.  Yet the dependence on Dupixent, which UBS says could account for a third of its sales in 2029, explains why the valuation of 11 times forward earnings is below peers with similar short-term growth prospects.

"Credit Suisse seeks to strike out Mozambique ‘tuna bonds’ case","Swiss bank claims failure to disclose government documents means there cannot be a fair trial","Credit Suisse has asked London’s High Court to strike out a lawsuit brought by Mozambique over the bank’s role in the $2bn “tuna bonds” scandal, claiming failures to disclose government documents mean there cannot be a fair trial. The Swiss bank and other parties are defending a lawsuit brought by the Republic of Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries, over their role in arranging $2bn of loans and bond issues for the country in 2013, ostensibly to fund projects including a state tuna fishery. The loans were partly concealed from the IMF and other donors, who cut support to the country after they were discovered.   A civil trial is due to start in the High Court in September.  It comes at a time when UBS, which completed its rescue of Credit Suisse this week, begins to wrestle with legacy issues at its former rival, including a number of existing lawsuits. In its application to the High Court, Credit Suisse claimed Mozambique’s failure to disclose documents from the office of its president as well as from the country’s state intelligence and security service meant that a fair trial would not be possible. Andrew Scott KC, barrister for Credit Suisse, told the court that the “breaches are serious” and were the result of “choices made by the Republic on what disclosure it will provide.” In written arguments, Credit Suisse claimed that Mozambique “remains in breach of its disclosure duties” and that the breaches were “wilful”. “Their effect is to preclude any possibility of a fair trial in the proceedings that the Republic chose to commence here,” the bank claimed. Mozambique told the hearing that it was “not accurate or fair to characterise the Republic as a recalcitrant litigant which has set its face against giving proper disclosure”.  In its written arguments Mozambique said there had been “strenuous efforts” to obtain documents and the bank’s application “gives no weight to the substantial efforts made by the Republic to meet and overcome the momentous challenges in giving disclosure which it has had to face”. It also said that “the assertion that there is a substantial body of relevant documents likely to be missing” from disclosure “is overblown and wrong”. “It would be wrong, at this stage, to assume that there is a substantial body of material missing as the applicants contend and thus that a fair trial is not possible.” Mozambique’s legal team said. Jonathan Adkin KC, barrister for the Republic of Mozambique, added in written submissions that a trial should go ahead because the case involves “an international fraud and official corruption on a vast scale” and the court can determine at trial “whether there is ‘missing’ material as alleged”. In 2021, Credit Suisse agreed to pay $475mn in fines and forgive $200mn of debt owed by Mozambique in a series of co-ordinated settlements with regulators in the US, UK and Switzerland over its role in the scandal. The three-day High Court hearing continues with a ruling from the judge expected at a later date.  ","13.06.2023"
"Jeremy Hunt insists Bank of England should keep focus on curbing inflation","Ensuring prices fall remains UK government’s ‘first priority’, chancellor tells parliamentary committee","UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that the Bank of England should remain focused on taming “dangerously high” inflation, despite the strain placed on the global banking sector by rising interest rates. Data to be published on Wednesday is expected to show UK inflation at close to 10 per cent, and Hunt on Tuesday said he had told BoE governor Andrew Bailey to do “what you think is necessary” to bring down prices. Asked whether fighting inflation was still the priority at a time of banking stress linked to higher interest rates, Hunt told the House of Lords economic affairs committee: “Yes it is. The prime minister’s first priority is to halve inflation.”  Investors have bet that the US Federal Reserve will be constrained in its ability to raise interest rates by fragility in the banking sector, but Hunt took a hawkish stance in evidence to the cross-party group of peers.  He confirmed that he had discussed with Bailey the impact of higher interest rates on the banking sector but said taming inflation, which he described as “dangerously high”, was key. “We need to do everything we can to maintain our focus on bringing it down,” he said. “I only ever say to him: ‘Please do what you think is necessary — as indeed you are legally bound to do under the Bank of England Act,’” added Hunt.  Jeremy Hunt at the House of Lords economic affairs committee © UK Parliament/PA Hunt accepted that the speed of recent interest rate rises was “the root cause of the volatility we have seen in recent months” and said it was important to fight inflation “in a way that maintains as best we are able stability in financial markets”. But he added: “Inflation is itself destabilising. It’s not an answer to say we are suddenly going to change our minds and say it’s acceptable to have a rate of inflation that is as destabilisingly high as 10 per cent.” The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee will set interest rates on Thursday, just 24 hours after the latest data on inflation, with a consensus view among economists that it could nudge just below 10 per cent.  Bigger falls in inflation are expected to follow in the next few months as last year’s surge in energy costs comes out of the year-on-year comparisons. But Hunt said that roughly 6.5 percentage points of the inflation number comprised “core inflation”, driven by non-energy factors such as pay rises. Lord Nicholas Macpherson, former permanent secretary to the Treasury, said the BoE should focus relentlessly on curbing inflation. “The BoE mustn’t subordinate its monetary to its financial stability objective,” he told the Financial Times. “Otherwise inflation will remain higher for longer, as in the end will interest rates.” Meanwhile Hunt defended his planned City of London regulatory reforms, promising that he would not do anything to undermine financial stability. “We won’t unlearn the lessons of the financial crisis,” he said. The chancellor also defended the Swiss government’s handling of the $3.2bn rescue-takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, which wiped out $17bn of its bonds, upending the normal “hierarchy of claims” for investors. Hunt said compromise had been needed to complete the sale, which represented “the best possible outcome”.  “I wholly support the decisions made by the Swiss authorities that made the purchase by UBS possible. In the circumstances, I think they took the right decision,” he said.   Hunt added that he had been assured by the BoE that the UK banking system was “immensely stronger” than it had been before the 2008 crash, but cautioned: “We have to remain vigilant.”","21.03.2023"
"Bank capital: buffers suffer credibility deficit amid liquidity panics","What that alphabet soup of acronyms means for investors","The turmoil in banking has left investors swimming in an alphabet soup of acronyms. They rightly question how useful it is to cling to such straws as capital ratios. After all, banks with irreproachable metrics unravelled anyway. Deposit flight toppled Silicon Valley Bank, Signature and Silvergate in the US. In Switzerland, Credit Suisse was rescued by UBS.  Some of these banks had good profitability, allowing them to generate excess capital. Others such as Credit Suisse had losses but apparently strong capital ratios. We will explain the various capital terms and their relevance.   For years, bank bosses, brokers and analysts have fetishised CET1. The acronym stands either for “common (or core) equity tier one” capital. This buffer consists of the most dispensable capital of the bank, shareholders’ equity and retained earnings. CET1 capital is the first line of defence wiped out in a crisis. After common equity evaporates the next buffer is additional tier one bonds (AT1 capital). These rank higher than equity in any bankruptcy or dissolution of the bank, though below more senior debt.  When they forced UBS to absorb Credit Suisse, the Swiss authorities stoked controversy by inverting that precedence, wiping out AT1 bondholders but not Credit Suisse shareholders. After AT1s comes tier two capital — bonds more senior than CET1 and AT1. The whole layer cake is meant to shield taxpayers from the cost of bank bailouts. After 2008, financial regulators recognised that lenders had too many assets, primarily loans, sitting atop too little equity. In 2007, Barclays held assets worth 38 times its shareholders’ equity. By last year that leverage had fallen by almost half, on S&P Capital IQ data. Regulators aimed to force leverage down by requiring banks to hold higher capital buffers to protect against the effects of loan losses. Using a weighting system developed with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, banks had to report their risk weighted assets, or RWAs.  In theory holding CET1 capital buffers against these RWAs (expressed as a percentage) is healthy. However, when depositor sentiment deteriorates badly, and an online exodus of funds occurs, capital buffers offer little protection from a liquidity shock. So, deposit flight has turned the spotlight on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). This measures the proportion of highly-liquid assets available compared to a month’s worth of cash outflows in regulator’s stress tests.  The focus has also shifted from a bank’s asset quality to what keeps depositors’ money at a bank. That in turn hinges on what proportion of these accounts are insured by governments. In the US, SVB had about 12 per cent of its deposits insured last year. JPMorgan had over 40 per cent.  Last week, Lex dismissed the frenzied sell-off in the shares of Germany’s leading lender Deutsche Bank. The bank holds plenty of capital and has sufficient profitability to replenish its capital buffers, unlike Credit Suisse which had racked up losses. Deutsche has built up cash reserves over the decade as well.  Also, compare Credit Suisse’s CET1 ratio with, say, Barclays. Not long before its forced sale to local rival UBS this month, the Swiss wealth manager reported a very respectable CET1 ratio of 14.1 per cent. Barclays is at 13.9 per cent.  But like Deutsche, Barclays has diversified its liability base and steadied its ship over the past decade. A substantial CET1 ratio did not prevent the collapse of Credit Suisse.  One lesson from this month’s crisis is that scale matters. Smaller banks will receive much more scrutiny from regulators everywhere. Another is that higher capital buffers may only offer comfort in normal periods. But bank capital requirements will be more not less onerous in the near term.  United Utilities: Great Stink II may land water groups with £56bn bill Picturesque Windermere is a favourite haunt of wild swimmers. Reports of sewage pouring into the lake’s waters sends them off the deep end. The problem riles investors too. United Utilities, the rainy north-west England water authority, has a quarter more sewer overflows than average. The government has demanded more than £14bn of investment from the company to address the problem. Water pollution is a big issue in the UK, as it was during London’s Great Stink in 1858. Sewage discharges now head a list of complaints also including high leakage rates and opaque finances. Campaigners, politicians and media are increasingly hostile. Regulated monopolies such as United Utilities tend to be steady earners. True to form, the company said revenues would be only 1 per cent lower than guided. Inflation will take a toll despite inflation-linked revenues. The utility is a heavy user of index-linked debt. Its net finance costs will be 6 per cent, or £10mn, higher than last year.  The valuation of water utilities is in line with the historical average, at a premium of 15 per cent to adjusted regulatory capital value. Yet the political risks of investing are rising. Politicians have responded to public anger by threatening fines of up to £250mn, a 1,000-fold  increase. Water companies will have to prepare better for droughts. They need to spend an estimated £20bn on cutting leaks and reducing usage. Water meters are part of that drive. About half of households have switched, in some cases compulsorily. But meters make it harder for water companies to increase bills to pay for necessary investment. The average bill per household would need to rise by a daunting 60 per cent in real terms, to £700 a year, to cover the £100bn of capital expenditure required across the industry, according to Barclays.   The cost of curbing sewage spills comprises £56bn of that figure. The Great Stink was remedied with new sewers that still serve that purpose today. Water companies may need to raise new equity and splurge retained earnings. That will focus attention on dividends. Payouts extracted via expensive loans from shareholders will receive unwonted scrutiny. As bond proxies, utilities have attractions. But amid a second Great Stink, investors should weigh up growing political risks before taking the plunge. Lex is the FT’s concise daily investment column.

"Letter: It’s a myth that capitalism is run on free-market rules","From Pritam Singh, Emeritus Professor in Economics, Oxford Brookes Business School, Oxford, UK ","Gillian Tett (“Trust in market rules is at stake as investors remain in limbo”, Opinion, March 21) is brilliantly lucid in highlighting the question of trust in the recent banking crisis, especially in relation to the manner in which additional tier-one bondholders of Credit Suisse have been treated in its takeover by UBS.  However, her argument on the necessary importance of trust is based on the assumption that free market functioning is central to the operation of a capitalist economy and in this case, that trust has been undermined because free-market principles have been “over-ruled” by “protectionism, geopolitical self-interest and state intervention”.  It is a myth that a capitalist economy is governed by the logic of free-market competition. The late Joan Robinson of Cambridge university long ago exploded this myth in her pioneering work The Economics of Imperfect Competition for which she deserved the Nobel Prize in economics denied to her — I suspect because she was viewed as leftwing.  I believe that Tett’s analysis would have been richer had she embedded into it those “over-ruling” forces — that is the competing interests as central to the way the capitalist economy always functions.

"Keep your friends close and private equity tycoons closer","Plus, Wall Street lawyers mourn their 2021 bonuses and a top Vodafone shareholder eyes its board composition","One thing to start: Wall Street and Washington scrambled to come up with a plan to stabilise First Republic after the ailing lender’s shares continued to plunge on Tuesday. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter Private equity gets political in the UKWall Street lawyers’ lacklustre bonus seasonVodafone’s board under scrutiny The Labour party’s private equity charm offensive Keep your friends close and private equity billionaires closer, right?  That’s the strategy UK Labour leader Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves have rolled out. The pair — despite planning to hit the industry with a £440mn tax raid — have decided they’ll have a better shot at getting into power with the masters of the universe on their side. The duo has held meetings with senior executives from investment groups including Blackstone, Advent International and Brookfield Asset Management in recent months, people familiar with the matter told DD’s Will Louch and the FT’s Jim Pickard, with the aim of bringing more private capital investment into the UK. Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer have used the meetings to talk about the role they see private capital playing in boosting economic growth and financing the energy transition  The recent talks signal Labour’s embrace of private equity’s increasing presence in the UK, from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice’s £10bn takeover of grocer Wm Morrison to the mega-buyout of Asda to US financier Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital’s purchase of Chelsea FC. But if the likes of Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Brookfield’s Bruce Flatt think they’ll get an easy ride if the Labour party unseats the incumbent government, they’re mistaken. DD readers might remember a little thing called carried interest — private equity executives’ often-lucrative share of profits on the funds they invest, which can also serve as a handy loophole for how much tax they pay on successful deals. Reeves has been vocal about closing that loophole, and has accused the industry of not paying enough tax and asset-stripping a “series” of strategically important British businesses including GKN.  The buyout industry remained hopeful it could prevent any change. But a Labour spokesperson told DD this week that the party would include the policy to change carried interest tax rules in its election manifesto, set to be drawn up this year. For fund managers, this is a big deal. Carried interest payments usually dwarf the salaries that private equity managers earn and can easily run into multimillion-pound payments. Currently, the payments are classed as a capital gain, so are taxed at 28 per cent rather than at the 45 per cent top income tax rate. Labour is proposing to change this, netting them an estimated £440mn a year, a change that has divided the industry. It’s still unclear whether Labour’s charm offensive will pay off and the party will be able to attract the capital it says it needs to grow the economy. Some private equity executives and advisers concede they’ve been lucky to get away with the favourable tax treatment for so long, while others think the tax increase will make the UK less competitive and add to the Brexit-spurred exodus of private equity executives to continental Europe.  Still, demanding a £440mn cheque is an interesting way to try to make friends. Corporate lawyers feel the dealmaking slump Last year was a tough year for corporate law firms. Unless you’re Kirkland & Ellis. The firm defended its position as the world’s highest-grossing law firm last year, increasing annual revenues nearly 8 per cent to $6.5bn. The haul comes as its rivals suffered steep profit and revenue drops in the absence of 2021’s rich pipeline of deals, reports the FT’s Kate Beioley. Partners at Latham & Watkins, the world’s second-highest grossing law firm, had their payouts fall 10 per cent to $5.1mn, according to results filed with industry publication the American Lawyer. Others fared even worse. Equity partners at Davis Polk & Wardwell took home $5.6mn in profit shares, 21 per cent less than the previous year, while Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft partners’ profit share plunged 30 per cent. It was a different story for the 505 equity partners at Kirkland, who took home $7.5mn on average, a slight increase from 2021, which helped the Chicago-based firm eclipse the payouts earned by partners at New York rival Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Kirkland was buoyed by a business model that acts as a one-stop-shop for private equity: after helping PE clients lever up companies in search of investment profits, they are also there to unwind mistakes made with a growing restructuring business. It also capitalised on a wave of crypto bankruptcies as partner Joshua Sussberg represented Voyager, Celsius Network, and BlockFi in their administration cases. Kirkland “doesn’t feel like a law firm, it feels like a hedge fund . . . They talk that way, they think that way, it’s all about maximising revenue and profit”, said Bruce MacEwen, president of law firm consultancy Adam Smith. But even Kirkland isn’t immune to the darkening economic outlook. It became the latest firm to cut headcount earlier this month as the private equity gravy train shows signs of slowing. Vodafone’s board structure comes under scrutiny, again Emirati investment group e& on Tuesday notified the market that it has again increased its stake in Vodafone — this time to 14.6 per cent. But because of stringent regulatory rules, it also had to make another public admission: it had discussed the “composition” of Vodafone’s non-executive board with representatives from the troubled British telecoms group. This is the first, albeit somewhat opaque, indication the market has received that e& may be less than delighted with Vodafone, which has lost nearly 30 per cent of its value in the past year. When it first announced that it had built a 10 per cent stake last year, it confessed complete support for the company and its board. Vodafone has sought to introduce more heft to its board since the start of 2022, when it came under fire from activist investor Cevian Capital for its lack of non-executive directors with telecoms experience. It has since brought Informa chief Stephen Carter and France Televisions boss Delphine Ernotte Cunci into the mix. Vodafone still has a number of longstanding non-executive directors, including London Stock Exchange boss Clara Furse, Reed’s former chief Crispin Davis and former Standard Life chief David Nish. State-controlled e&, keen to transform itself into a technology company and to expand globally beyond the Middle East and Africa, may want a refresh. Job moves Senior Citigroup executive Paul Barrett has left the bank, days after the Wall Street Journal reported he had met with the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein on several occasions while working at JPMorgan Chase. NatWest chair Howard Davies has announced he will step down from his role by the middle of next year. UBS has hired three Barclays bankers in New York, according to a memo seen by DD: Marco Valla joins as global banking co-head (his predecessor Ros L’Esperance will launch a senior advisory group within the Swiss bank) as well as Jeff Hinton and Kurt Anthony. Separately UBS chief risk officer Christian Bluhm, who announced plans in November to become a full-time photographer, will stay on “for the foreseeable future” following its Credit Suisse takeover, delaying the transition to newly appointed risk control head of integration Damian Vogel. Former Salesforce co-chief Keith Block has launched Smith Point Capital with Vista Equity Partners’ Burke Norton and Longfellow Capital’s Chris Lytle. Paul Hastings has hired Kirkland & Ellis’s John Budetti as a partner in New York and global chair of the investment funds and private capital practice.

"Odey Asset Management halts trading in fourth fund","Crispin Odey quits as a director of ICP Holdings, which operates in the Lloyd’s of London market","Odey Asset Management has suspended trading in a fourth fund following a “sizeable level” of withdrawal requests in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against founder Crispin Odey, which have precipitated the break-up of one of London’s oldest hedge fund firms. The firm said in a letter to investors on Friday that it was temporarily suspending trading in its $80mn Special Situations fund to sell assets in an “orderly fashion” to meet the redemptions. Meanwhile, Crispin Odey resigned on Thursday as a director of ICP Holdings, a group of companies operating in the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.  The moves cap a tumultuous week for both the firm and its founder since the Financial Times published last Thursday an investigation into allegations of sexual assault or harassment from 13 women against Crispin Odey. He strenuously denies the allegations. The firm said on Thursday it was in “advanced discussions” about transferring certain funds and staff to rival companies. Odey Asset Management earlier this week halted trading in three other funds — Brook Developed Markets, LF Odey Portfolio and Brook Absolute Return — and closed the Odey Swan fund, because of the higher than usual volume of withdrawal requests. The Swan fund, which was managed by Crispin Odey and houses €117mn of assets, is being liquidated so that money can be returned to shareholders. The measure to halt withdrawals from the other funds is one of the emergency actions taken by the firm to mitigate the effects of investors and institutions cutting ties with Odey Asset Management. This week, the FT reported that JPMorgan was terminating its relationship with the asset manager, serving notice on its prime broking and custody relations. Prime brokers provide hedge funds with stock lending, lending and other services, while custodians safeguard customers’ money. It is a regulatory requirement for hedge funds to have a custodian in place. UBS also moved to cut ties with Odey Asset Management as a prime broker, following Morgan Stanley, Exane, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

			 Odey Asset Management, which oversees about $4.4bn, is now in talks with rivals about offloading funds and managers in a move that could spell the end of the firm that Crispin Odey founded in 1991.   The firm said on Thursday that “any sale or rehousing is considered subject of course to any relevant regulatory approvals and due diligence, with a view to an orderly transition of any assets and investors”. However, it did not name the companies engaged in the discussions. The firm’s biggest funds include Brook European Focus Fund, run by Oliver Kelton, and LF Brook Absolute Return Fund, run by James Hanbury. Odey Asset Management created the Brook brand in 2020 and rebadged several funds with the moniker. Crispin Odey’s departure from ICP Holdings is detailed in filings first reported by Bloomberg.  The group includes a corporate member, or insurer, at Lloyd’s, that had £104mn of underwriting capacity last year, according to company accounts.   Lloyd’s declined to comment on whether Crispin Odey is a participant in the market, but said “all members and participants at Lloyd’s are expected to meet the standards we set and action may be taken where those standards are not met”.  Odey Asset Management also has an 8 per cent holding in Aim-listed Helios Underwriting, which owns a portfolio of insurance entities within Lloyd’s. Helios declined to comment.","16.06.2023"
"Welcome to Substack, Zoltan","haha just kidding . . . unless?","So it’s official. The Jules Verne of investment research (H/T Adam Tooze) has left Credit Suisse after it was devoured by UBS. Zoltan Poszar made a cameo appearance at a New York Federal Reserve event on Friday, sporting a nametag that gave his professional status as “TBD,” according to the WSJ. (Though Bloomberg seems to have gotten the first scoop on his “former” status). Look who's here - Lord Pozsar, at the NY Fed conference; says Fed's proactiveness w.r.t banking crisis (e.g BTFP) indicates their will to tame inflation.  This is precisely why the March hike was more likely (not less) after those measures were announced. pic.twitter.com/tY8inNFl5O— Rishi Mishra (@aRishisays) May 5, 2023

 Many Alphaville readers will already be familiar with a man whose fame means he is often just goes by his first name. Most will have already made up their minds on whether Zoltan is a unique market savant, or (in the words of former Alphavillain Jamie Powell) the “late period John Coltrane” of investment research.   But he unquestionably has an unusual amount of star power and name recognition for a sellside analyst specialising in the more exotic aspects of capital markets, so there’s naturally a lot of speculation of what he might do next.  Zoltan is not . . . universally respected by some rival analysts, so a move to a similar role at another bank might be tricky. Anyway, most banks will probably not give him the freedom to roam as much as Credit Suisse did, which would neuter what made Zoltan special. Investment groups would face a similar issue. Basically, why hire Zoltan if you can’t let him be #Zoltan?  Perhaps he’ll end up somewhere he can still do chunky research that doesn’t need to be instantly monetisable, such as back at the NY Fed, the IMF or some other think-tank. But honestly, we’d love to see him start a Substack. Zoltan unfiltered by compliance and editing, free to tackle whatever subject he pleases.  And the more you think about it, it kinda makes sense? As Dan Davies wrote elsewhere on Alphaville today, sellside research is already somewhat similar to the Substack model.  You produce theoretically monetisable content but the real money is in developing “a slightly weird parasocial relationship with your readers, such that they will look after you through other channels, hire you for jobs, pay you consulting fees and so on”.  In the meantime — Zoltan, get in touch! Alphaville can offer you a temporary home while you figure out the TBD thing.

"Now is the time to buy bank shares","The sector looks well positioned to outperform just as some in the market have deemed it to be uninvestable","The writer is founder and chief executive of Algebris Investments “Shoot first, ask questions later” has been an apt description of the US and European bank space in recent weeks. With calm returning, should investors be buying UK and European banks? The perhaps surprising answer is yes. Let me explain. Nerves have been frayed after the shuttering of three banks in the US by regulators. One of those banks, Silicon Valley Bank, made a massive losing bet on interest rates, and the other two had dived into crypto mania. All three were supervised under light-touch regulation.   Of course, the UK and Europe learned the lesson of under-regulation in the global financial crisis and addressed it in the decade that followed. We will shortly see a similar reversal from the US regulator. But the key point is that the rate bet that SVB put on would not even have been permissible in Europe, as regulations restrict banks from rate mismatches through stress tests and additional capital requirements. European banks prudently operate well below these thresholds; SVB was miles above. Nonetheless, the Swiss have not escaped the recent turmoil. Credit Suisse had been in trouble for several years, making significant losses, and even saw its own deposit run last year, losing 40 per cent of its deposits.  When the deposit outflows reaccelerated following the SVB crisis, the bank’s regulator, Finma, pushed it to sell itself to UBS. In our view, this could well end up being the deal of the decade for UBS. UBS’s tangible book value increased 74 per cent on the transaction, it picked up jewel assets in Credit Suisse’s wealth management and Swiss banking units, and it has material buffers embedded in the deal to pay for the cost-cutting and restructuring over the coming years. But Credit Suisse was a huge outlier among European banks in that it was unprofitable and was funded largely by an unstable, flighty deposit base. This is an undesirable combination but importantly not typical in the rest of Europe, where banks have large proportions of sticky household deposits and high and rising levels of profitability. The sector’s liquidity coverage ratio — a measure of the level of easy-to-sell assets held by banks to meet short-term needs — in the US is 120 per cent. In Europe it is 160 per cent. The numbers speak for themselves.  The bulk of the sector is making its highest profits in the past 15 years. Take NatWest, which has seen its return on tangible equity double, from around 9 per cent a year ago to closer to 20 per cent. It is not hard to see why. One consequence of low/negative interest rates over the past decade has been that banks have not been able to earn returns from half their balance sheets (the deposits). With rates now higher, both sides of the balance sheet are contributing to profits, and for the first time in over a decade, banks can earn their cost of equity. On top of this, capital return has become a hugely attractive component of the investment case for European banks. After years of building up capital ratios from extremely low levels, banks sit on mountains of excess capital and regulators are waving through significant returns of capital to shareholders.   For the first time in two decades, share counts are going down at European banks. Very low market caps and significant capital return policies combine for payout yields (including dividends and share buybacks) in some cases near 20 per cent for national champion banks such as BNP, NatWest, ING, and UniCredit. Quite clearly, the market is stuck looking in the rear-view mirror of the past decade.   Of course, it has generally been correct not to own UK and European bank equity from just before the global financial crisis of 2007-08 until the end of 2020. The European bank index performed dreadfully over this period, due to the twin problems of capital inadequacy and negative interest rates.  But just as it was right to avoid the sector when rates were at their lows and banks needed massive restructuring, investors should now note how things have been transformed. Capital ratios are demonstrably higher than before the financial crisis, and meaningfully above those of US peers as well. European banks have the strongest liquidity in recent years and are buying back record amounts of shares.  The banks offer dividend yields of around 7 per cent with buybacks on top. Yet the shares are trading at their lowest levels relative to broader markets over the last 15 years. Banks now look to be well positioned to outperform, just as some in the market have deemed them — simplistically — to be uninvestable.

"US regional bank stocks still under pressure","Refurbished iPhones boost Apple’s share of Indian market","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘US regional bank stocks still under pressure’ Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Wednesday, May 3rd. This is your FT News Briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING]  The big rescue of First Republic has not stopped anxiety around other regional banks. And consumers in India are snapping up Apple’s iPhones, just not the new ones. Plus, European banks are hoping to scoop up some of Credit Suisse’s business, but what’s left for the picking? Stephen MorrisWhat you have at Credit Suisse investment bank, with the greatest respect to the people still working there, I would say is a bit of the rump rather than the prime rib. Marc FilippinoI’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] In the US, the rescue of First Republic did not reassure investors about what could happen to other similar regional banks. Their stocks plunged yesterday. Shares in another California lender, PacWest, lost about 28 per cent. Arizona-based Western Alliance Bank saw its shares go down more than 15 per cent. Here to talk more about this is the FT’s US banking correspondent, Stephen Gandel. Hi, Stephen. Stephen GandelHi. Thanks for having me on again.  Marc FilippinoSo, Stephen, why did anyone think that JPMorgan rescuing First Republic would end investor anxiety? Stephen GandelWell, because like, if you’re worried about the banking system, it did help the banking system. There, it wasn’t . . . There are no depositors that lost any money. The employees of First Republic are largely gonna be employees of JPMorgan. And so for the banking system, it’s a win. The problem is for someone who was an investor in the stock, they have none of their money. They were completely wiped out. So you have this dichotomy where the depositors should be less worried. And so therefore, we thought that was gonna reassure the system. But the stock investors are actually more worried. Marc FilippinoSo it sounds like, Stephen, investors might be worried that some of these other banks could end up like First Republic. Stephen GandelYes. So I think what investors have done is looked around and say, OK, so what, what bank out there looks like First Republic or looks like Silicon Valley Bank. So if you look at the two stocks, Pacific West and Western Alliance, they both have these businesses where they lend to venture capital funds and venture companies and start-ups. And that was all of the business at Silicon Valley, right? And so I think that’s what’s going on. Investors are saying, like, I don’t want to be near any problems. So if something looks like Silicon Valley or something looks like First Republic, I don’t want to be in that stock. Marc FilippinoSo just to be clear, and I think this is important for our listeners: there is no new piece of information about these banks that lost . . . Sure. Nothing, right . . .  Stephen GandelNothing in terms of the fundamentals about these banks. We learned absolutely nothing yesterday. Right? There’s no new news. The earnings are out, right? The quarter was over.  Marc FilippinoYeah, we saw it in First Republic’s recent earnings report that customers withdrew more than $100bn in deposits. Do we see anything like that in other banks? Stephen GandelSo these banks have not seen anywhere near the loss in deposits that First Republic had. And it is kind of curious because the earnings for many of these banks were better than expected, right? They’re still benefiting from the fact that for a long time they didn’t have to pay very much on deposits. But if you look forward and you saw this in First Republic’s earnings report, they are gradually getting more underwater in term . . . meaning that what they now have to pay to keep deposits, what they now have to pay to attract new deposits — that right now is more than what they’re earning on their loans and their investments. So the earnings were better than expected for the first quarter, but there was a sign in their earnings reports that the earnings are about to get a whole lot worse than expected. Marc FilippinoAnd just to be clear, the thing that everyone is waiting for is the effect that higher interest rates and quickly raised interest rates is going to have on these banks, right? Stephen GandelRight. And we’re gonna get more bad news on this potentially today when the Fed makes its announcement. So if there are hopes that the bad news on the interested side for the banks was gonna subside, it’s not gonna happen today. Marc FilippinoYeah, And the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point today. Stephen Gandel is the FT’s US banking correspondent. Thanks for your time, Stephen. Stephen GandelThank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc FilippinoApple is getting a boost in India from refurbished iPhones. They accounted for 11 per cent of India’s secondary smartphone sales last year. That’s up from 3 per cent the year before. That makes Apple the fastest growing refurbished brand in India, according to one market research group. It’s good news for Apple, which is banking on India for its future growth. The second-hand market is a gateway into other Apple products and services. The iPhone maker actually just opened up its first two Apple stores in the country. [MUSIC PLAYING] When UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse, a huge competitor disappeared from the banking landscape. Now, other European banks are hoping to scoop up some of Credit Suisse’s business. Here to talk more about this is the FT’s banking editor, Stephen Morris. Hi, Stephen. Stephen MorrisHello. Marc FilippinoWe focused a lot on the deal with UBS buying Credit Suisse. But what does the collapse of Credit Suisse do to the banking industry as a whole? Stephen MorrisSo Santander, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, they’re all going after, you know, the few people at Credit Suisse who are left, are still good — the bankers, the dealmakers, the traders, but also in particular their clients. So it’s really opened up this space. Deutsche, for example, is known for shrinking its investment bank and reining in its ambitions. But our story earlier this week showed that they’ve already hired 26 managing directors, kind of the most senior rank or grade within the investment bank and plan to hire many more. Now we think about half of those are from Credit Suisse. Marc FilippinoSo is there gonna be a bank that benefits the most from the collapse of Credit Suisse? Stephen MorrisWell, Credit Suisse’s most lucrative product, product lines and the ones that UBS are gonna try and keep are, of course, in wealth management and in particular in Asia. That’s where they made a lot of their money. And that’s where as a Swiss bank, they could stand out against those on Wall Street. I would say the biggest beneficiary of Credit Suisse’s collapse is probably Barclays, which has long been struggling to establish itself as the number six investment bank worldwide. So if Barclays can pick up a lot of this business and sustainably show that it can make profits for the next year or so, perhaps the demise of Credit Suisse could actually be a very good news story for its London-based rival. Marc FilippinoBarclays seems to be the best placed. They have a lot to gain here, but is there enough to go around for all the big competitors across European banking? Stephen MorrisThere probably is enough business to go around. Credit Suisse was a very big business for a long time, so I would say that there’s definitely enough to be split up against smaller competitors. I’d point you back to this much longer two-to-three-year period of decline where a lot of the best people at Credit Suisse and a lot of their most lucrative clients had already left, in essence. So what you have at Credit Suisse investment bank, with the greatest respect to the people still working there, I would say is a bit of the rump rather than the prime rib. Marc FilippinoStephen Morris is the FT’s banking editor. Thanks, Stephen. Stephen MorrisThank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc FilippinoBefore we go, the American activist investor Carl Icahn is known for targeting companies and forcing changes in management. Now, Icahn himself is a target. New York investment firm Hindenburg Research said yesterday that it is shorting Icahn’s publicly listed fund called Icahn Enterprises. That means Hindenburg’s placing bets that the stock is gonna fall. This is the third major short from Hindenburg this year. It went after the Indian conglomerate Adani Group and the payment company Block. Hindenburg says Icahn Enterprises is overvalued and the worth of some of its private assets is inflated. Carl Icahn said in a statement yesterday that his company stands by its public disclosures. But Hindenburg’s report triggered a sell-off and shares in Icahn Enterprises plunged. The stock price ended the day down about 20 per cent. [MUSIC PLAYING] You can read more on all of these stories at FT.com. This has been your daily FT News Briefing.

"New job, new you? Well, maybe . . . ","Changing careers can be exciting — but it’s not always the answer to working life’s problems","I met an undergraduate recently who was working alongside her studies. Not in a traditional student job, pulling pints or stacking shelves, but advising a marketing agency on youth trends. “Is that what you want to do when you graduate,” I asked naively. “God no,” came the reply. “That’s not my passion.” I nodded sympathetically. This was no place for a lecture on the difficulties of pursuing passion at work, which can put undue pressure on jobs to be not just a means to a pay cheque but a calling. Or worse, lead to exploitation by employers — or, as Sarah Jaffe put it in her book Work Won’t Love You Back, “the labour of love . . . is a con”. The student’s fresh-faced enthusiasm, however, thawed my frozen heart — if you can’t be optimistic with your whole future ahead of you, when can you? But another reason to hold back was that I had recently read about UBS’s chief risk officer, who is to leave the Swiss bank to become a photographer, in the process swapping a highly paid job presumably for a more creative — dare I say it, passion-fuelled — one.  In the past few years, these dramatic stories have become commonplace. The Great Resignation was a term that emerged from the pandemic to describe workers whose skills were in high demand, switching jobs for higher salaries and sign-on bonuses. But it also included those who re-evaluated their lives and changed careers, leading some to see it as a “pandemic midlife crisis”. As one opinion piece put it: “By disrupting our lives and placing us in a deeply unfamiliar world, while also confronting our own mortality, Covid-19 created a universal turning point . . . a standard characteristic of the identity crisis typically associated with middle age.”  A dramatic career change is intoxicating for those toiling at their laptops, plugged into endless Zoom meetings. Though perhaps the former health secretary Matt Hancock’s undignified appearance on reality TV show I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here!, where he was filmed eating a camel’s penis — and more — is a warning of taking things too far. Stories of big changes conceal the effort that goes into laying the groundwork. One friend who left banking for art, started by painting in the evenings and weekends, building up commissions. And he was helped to find his destination by working as an architect in his twenties before falling into banking. Most people are not in this camp, says Lucy Standing, a business psychologist and founder of Brave Starts, a non-profit for people wanting to find their next professional step. More common are those dissatisfied with their present role but clueless about an alternative.  Employers need to make it easier for midlife workers to test out new careers. Apart from a few schemes for career conversion, such as teaching, social work and policing, it can be hard to see how to make a switch. So many employers focus their campaigns on persuading new graduates to join them when they could also include those further along in their careers. In Standing’s experience, those that do make drastic career changes in midlife are the minority, usually with “good financial support”, through a higher-earning partner or savings, which I guess is the case for the UBS banker-turned-photographer. Nonetheless, the idea that a dramatic career change is the cure for dissatisfaction can be a source of uneasiness or paralysis. Tweaks might be a solution, perhaps by going part-time and pursuing a creative project as a side hustle or even as a hobby — something enjoyed purely for pleasure.  In the film Living, Bill Nighy stars as Mr Williams, a man sleepwalking through life, commuting to and from his bureaucratic job at London county council. One day is the same as the next: “Not happy, not unhappy,” he says. (Spoiler alert.) A terminal cancer diagnosis wakes him from his zombie slumber and he goes Awol from his job, spending his savings and getting drunk in burlesque bars on the hunt for fun and frivolity. This is not, he discovers, how he wants to spend his remaining months and instead returns energised to his job, finding joy through turning an east London bomb site into a small children’s playground.   Little changes may prove more meaningful than we expect. emma.jacobs@ft.com","20.11.2022"
"UK government sells £1.26bn of NatWest shares","Sale reduces public stake in bank to below 40%","The British government is selling £1.26bn worth of its stake in NatWest, reducing its ownership of the lender that it bailed out in 2008 to below 40 per cent. The sale, announced on Monday, will cut the government’s stake in the high street bank to 38.6 per cent, down from 41.4 per cent. “Today’s sale is another major milestone in returning NatWest to full private ownership as promised,” said City minister Andrew Griffith. “The government has now sold well over half of its shareholding.”  The shares will be sold to NatWest at Friday’s closing price of 268.4p, well below the 502p the government paid in 2008 in the £46bn bailout of the lender then known as RBS. At its height, the government owned 84 per cent of the bank, one of the big four high-street lenders. Alison Rose, group chief executive, said: “This transaction reduces government ownership below 40 per cent and demonstrates positive progress on the bank’s strategic priorities and the path to privatisation.” In April, UK Government Investments, which handles the stake for the government, said it would extend the deadline for its “trading plan”, which allows the government to sell its stake gradually over time at market prices, by two years to August 11 2025. The treasury still intends to fully exit its shareholding by 2025-26, “subject to market conditions and achieving value for money for taxpayers”. NatWest has a total market capitalisation of about £25bn. Since 2013, the stock has on average traded at barely half the average price of the bailout, in part a reflection of its shift from global player and part of a consortium which took over Dutch lender ABN Amro in 2007 to a primarily domestically focused UK bank. Shares were steady at 270.30p on Monday morning and have traded flat over the past six months. NatWest reported stronger than expected profits in recent quarters, benefiting from the Bank of England’s efforts to beat inflation by pushing up interest rates, though customer deposit outflows in the first quarter disappointed analysts.  As with other lenders, its share price was affected by uncertainty in the markets stemming from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other smaller US lenders, as well as the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by rival UBS. “One would have hoped the share price would have been even stronger, but that’s the way banks are valued at the moment,” NatWest chair Howard Davies told the FT in April.  He will depart the bank by the middle of next year before he reaches nine years of tenure, the maximum recommended time to serve in the role under the UK corporate governance code.","22.05.2023"
"The fallout from the banking turmoil","A repeat of 2008 is unlikely, but investors worry about a potential credit squeeze","It has been a frantic two weeks. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 sparked a domino effect that toppled another regional US lender, Signature Bank, spooked global markets, and led to the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. Bank shares fell again on Friday, led by Deutsche Bank — prompting chancellor Olaf Scholz to insist there was “no reason to be concerned” about the German lender. Regulators and central banks appeared to have brought some stability this week, but it is still unclear if more dominoes will fall. The trigger for the turbulence — high interest rates — remains a threat; confidence is shaken and vulnerabilities in the banking sector could metastasise. It may not be over yet. For starters, the fallout from the past two weeks is still being cleaned up. First Republic, another US regional leader, is still tottering and shares in similar banks are under pressure amid concerns that they, like SVB, hold lots of interest rate-sensitive assets. The UBS acquisition of Credit Suisse also has repercussions. The record of shotgun bank marriages is varied, and the giant new entity will take on even greater global importance. The structure of the deal — with convertible bondholders wiped out but shareholders receiving a payout — has made investors question the hierarchy of claims in the event of bank failures. Equity is usually junior to these bonds, though Swiss regulators say small print allowed this to be overridden. Legal battles are set to follow. The authorities have acted to stem contagion in the banking sector. The US Federal Reserve’s generous liquidity scheme, concerted central bank action, and reassurances have helped. Remarks by US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, however, sowed confusion over whether deposit insurance above the mandated $250,000 — as with the collapsed SVB and Signature Bank — would be in place if others fail, driving a sell-off in shares of smaller US banks. Interest rate risks loom beyond banks too: overleveraged sectors and investment funds with rate-sensitive assets remain exposed.   Those risks could yet intensify. With the battle against inflation not yet conclusively won, central banks need to nudge rates higher. Following its 25 basis point rise midweek, the Fed indicated one more rate increase in the pipeline; the European Central Bank has even further to go. The Bank of England also lifted rates by 25bp. Recent events are a reminder that rate rises do not feed through smoothly. Indeed, Fed chair Jay Powell implied fewer increases may now be necessary as the turmoil itself helps to tighten financial conditions. Even if more banks are not toppled, there is a real risk of a broad credit squeeze. Higher interest rates have already slashed lending to the real economy, and banks are likely to raise their lending standards even further in response to recent events. Property lending appears particularly vulnerable. If credit tightens significantly, a spiral of falling prices and defaults is possible. In the US, the bulk of commercial real estate lending comes via the smaller lenders that are now under pressure. Those needing to refinance loans could face challenges. Mortgage-backed securities held by banks are already taking a hit, risking a self-reinforcing cycle. For all the fears, a crisis on the scale of 2008 remains unlikely. Bank capital is stronger now, and failures have largely been due to idiosyncratic exposures and poor management. The authorities have been reassuringly proactive in offering support. Lending standards are better now too. But a tightening of credit is inevitable; how severe is unclear. And with the recent turmoil taking root in the less-regulated regional US banking sector, it remains possible that other vulnerabilities are lurking elsewhere. Rather than a blip, this episode could be a sign of things to come.

"Europe’s bank resolution authority seeks ‘firepower’ to deal with collapsed lenders","Chair Dominique Laboureix calls for policymakers to ‘come back to the drawing board’","Europe’s bank resolution authority is pushing policymakers to provide more “firepower” to protect depositors and rethink how lenders are wound down after recent failures underscored the need for swift and decisive action in a crisis.  Silicon Valley Bank’s implosion in March prompted the US to invoke emergency powers to guarantee immediate full repayment of all its depositors. Credit Suisse’s shotgun marriage to UBS a week later was eased by the Swiss National Bank’s offer of billions of euros in guaranteed funding to the merged entity.  On Thursday, the SNB called for a review of banking regulations as it warned that existing global rules on capital and liquidity were insufficient. The Bank of England is also reviewing its framework for resolving smaller banks and its deposit insurance scheme in the wake of the crisis.   In Europe, work was already in train on a revamped crisis management framework to reduce the potential for losses to taxpayers or depositors, but Dominique Laboureix, chair of the Single Resolution Board, said that while the package was “good step in the right direction”, there was more to do. “We need [policymakers] to come back to the drawing board on the issue of funding in resolution,” said Laboureix, whose institution is charged with safely winding down large or systemic eurozone banks that run into difficulty, a group that currently numbers 115.  “If we are confronted with a resolution decision during a weekend . . . we cannot say, OK, let’s ask the central bank to give a liquidity line supported by a guarantee from the government,” he added. “That is not possible in the European context.” Offering liquidity to a failing bank is one of the key tools to maintain depositor confidence and reduce the risk of a bank run by reassuring customers they can get their money out if they want to.  “The idea is to increase our firepower because we think that under exceptional circumstances we think it would be better if we had a bit more of a solution [on liquidity],” Laboureix said, stressing that “in the majority of cases, we have already sufficient resources”.  The SRB, one of the pillars of the EU’s plan for a banking union across its member states’ borders, wants the European Central Bank to agree to fund banks in resolution, potentially backed by an EU government guarantee. The SRB can currently access funding lines through the Single Resolution Fund and the European Stability Mechanism.   “We need a framework that gives us the tools to act, without making the decision-making process so difficult in terms of actors and endorsements that we cannot make a decision,” said Laboureix. “If it’s too complex, it won’t work.”  Laboureix said his proposed solution would need “clear inter-institutional support” from EU member states, the ECB and the resolution authorities.  He said it was “realistic” to expect the ECB to support the measure because it already extended emergency liquidity assistance to banks that were in difficulty. The new lines would not necessarily be drawn, rather their existence would improve confidence: “It’s a way of showing that if there is a need of liquidity support, we are here”.  The ECB declined to comment but in 2018 its then vice-president Vítor Constâncio called for such a measure, saying the collapse of Banco Popular the previous year had highlighted the need for a eurozone liquidity facility for banks in resolution. Laboureix also said the damage to the market for contingent convertible bank debt — additional tier 1 bonds known as AT1s — was not as bad as feared after the Swiss authorities cancelled $17bn of Credit Suisse’s AT1s without first wiping out the bank’s shareholders. “The reality is that the AT1 market worldwide is not broken by the decisions they [the Swiss] have taken,” the SRB chair said, adding that the actions of the Swiss had “absolutely” preserved global financial stability.

"EU vows to respect bondholders’ rights after Credit Suisse turmoil","Single Resolution Board chair adamant Brussels will not take investors in bank debt ‘by surprise’","A senior EU policymaker has pledged not to wrongfoot investors by upending bank creditor hierarchies, after a market uproar at Switzerland’s decision to favour shareholders over bondholders in the rescue takeover of Credit Suisse. Dominique Laboureix, chair of the Single Resolution Board, the body in charge of shutting down failed banks, said fears that additional tier 1 (AT1) bank debt is “not investable anymore” should not apply in the EU.  Values of risky bank debt fell in Europe on Monday after Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders were left with nothing as part of a rescue deal, under which Swiss rival UBS bought the troubled lender. The decision overturned established assumptions that debt holders would be prioritised over equity holders. The bank’s shareholders received SFr3bn ($3.3bn) from UBS, while bondholders lost $17bn.   The bond market jitters led the SRB, the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank to put out a statement stressing that common equity instruments would continue to be the first ones to absorb losses, with AT1 written down only afterwards. The Bank of England made similar remarks.  Laboureix insisted that notwithstanding the decisions in Switzerland, EU authorities would continue to stick to the established pecking order for investors. “We won’t take them by surprise,” he said. “We should be extremely clear on this crucial element: yes indeed we want to follow this order, because it gives clarity to the investors,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “If not, who will invest in banking issuances, if there is this possibility that each and every authority in the EU can decide whatever it wants depending on the conditions of the day?” AT1s were introduced in the wake of the financial crisis as part of reforms aimed at reducing the risk of taxpayers being called upon to support failing banks. The securities have grown into a market worth about $260bn.  Andrea Enria, the ECB’s chief supervisor, echoed Laboureix’s remarks in a hearing before the EU parliament on Tuesday. “This type of approach would not be feasible under the European framework,” Enria said, adding that they would wipe out bank equity before bonds regardless of whether a bank had to be wound down or was taken over by another lender. Concerns among investors following the weekend’s events were “understandable”, said Laboureix, adding that he was not criticising the Swiss authorities which were acting on specific national financial stability concerns.   The decisions in Switzerland — coupled with efforts by the US authorities to underpin confidence following the failure of two banks and to boost global dollar liquidity — showed authorities were taking the necessary steps to stabilise the markets.   “They are taking their responsibilities all over the globe — that’s extremely good in terms of financial stability,” said Laboureix, who was appointed to the SRB in November 2022. He previously held the position of secretary-general of the French Prudential Supervisory Authority.  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here The SRB, which began operations in 2015, was one of the institutions that sprang out from European capitals’ efforts to prevent a rerun of the financial crisis. It has responsibility for ensuring that a failure of one financial institution does not spread turmoil throughout the banking system.  Brussels has been working on draft legislation on crisis management that would ensure a more consistent treatment of lenders that get into trouble, reducing the risk of drawing on public funds.  Policymakers including Paschal Donohoe, president of the eurogroup of finance ministers, have called for this legislation to be advanced soon, but the proposals will be contentious among member states.  The draft coming from the European Commission would be “balanced”, Laboureix said. “It’s about giving more confidence and credibility to our resolution and, more broadly, crisis-management framework in Europe. And this matters.”  Additional reporting by Martin Arnold in Frankfurt Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","21.03.2023"
"UniCredit/BPM: a tempting morsel for another day","Italian bank has made progress streamlining its business — buying rival would add complications","When a bank is led by a veteran dealmaker, it is tempting to think it might pursue some transactions. So it is over at Italy’s UniCredit, where former UBS banker Andrea Orcel holds the reins. News that one of the bank’s key Italian investors thinks buying €6.2bn rival Banca Popolare di Milano might be a good idea was enough to reignite — periodically recurring —  mergers and acquisitions speculation. The potential target’s stock rose more than 10 per cent on Wednesday.  One can see the appeal. BPM would increase the group’s branch market share to 18 per cent, from Unicredit’s current 11 per cent, according to broker Equita. That would narrow the gap with Italy’s largest lender, Intesa. BPM’s strong roots in the industrialised and wealthy North would benefit Unicredit’s historically weaker position. No surprise that UniCredit was reportedly preparing to pounce on BPM just before the Russia-Ukraine crisis forced a rethink.  Financially, a deal might stack up. If UniCredit paid a 30 per cent all cash premium to BPM’s current value that would imply a premium of €1.7bn. It could recover this by lopping perhaps €400mn off the operating cost base, about 16 per cent. Taxed and capitalised the savings should exceed €2.5bn.   A bigger concern might be the deal’s impact on Unicredit’s common equity tier one capital ratio, 14.9 per cent last year. But an all-share acquisition should mitigate this effect, even assuming some writedowns and restructuring costs.  UniCredit shareholders would not necessarily applaud a bid. For one, the bank has done well without BPM. Improving profitability and strong capital meant the group secured regulatory approval to distribute €5.25bn in dividends and share buybacks, not bad on a market value of €38bn. Having made progress streamlining its business, buying would add complications. Some knots still exist, including its remaining €4.2bn exposure to Russia.

"Swiss fund manager GAM rushes to find buyer before results","Investment firm seeks deal after share price collapse and delay to earnings report","GAM is scrambling to find a buyer ahead of results it has delayed by two months, five years after a scandal over private debt holdings that led to fines, the resignation of the investment firm’s chief executive and a collapse in its share price. The Switzerland-listed fund manager recently postponed the release of its annual results to the end of April, hoping the extra time would allow it to strike a deal, according to several people familiar with the situation. GAM declined to comment. GAM appointed UBS bankers at the end of last year to work on securing a sale of the firm after its share price dropped by 97 per cent from the start of 2018, pushing its market value below SFr100mn ($107mn) and sparking questions over its future as a standalone business. UBS declined to comment.  The urgent search for a buyer comes after a torrid period for what was once one of Europe’s biggest asset managers.  Its troubles arose in July 2018 when it suspended former star fund manager Tim Haywood with little explanation, leaving holders of his Absolute Return Bond funds rushing to the exits. It later transpired that Haywood had bought bonds relating to Lex Greensill’s now collapsed supply chain finance business Greensill Capital, which counted former UK prime minister David Cameron as an adviser. Insiders at Zurich-based GAM had expressed concerns about the nature of Haywood’s relationship with Australian financier Greensill, which ultimately led to the liquidation of the funds. Chief executive Alexander Friedman stepped down. Haywood was subsequently fired and in 2021 GAM was hit with a £9.1mn fine by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for conflicts of interest. GAM’s share price has plunged to SFr0.60 from nearly SFr18 before the Haywood scandal. Assets have dropped from more than SFr160bn at that time to SFr75bn today, making the manager vulnerable to a takeover approach. Losses at GAM are expected to widen to SFr42.8mn for 2022, from SFr9.6mn the previous year. Still, its investment portfolios remain solid. GAM said in January that more than half of its largest strategies were ranked in the top decile among peers over three years, and two-thirds of its assets under management had outperformed their peer group, as measured by Morningstar. Insurance company Generali was a potential suitor in 2019, people familiar with the matter say, although GAM said at the time that it was not in conversations with the Italian company.  GAM has since attempted to slash costs under chief executive Peter Sanderson, who came on board at the end of 2019, spending millions of Swiss francs on a partnership with software company SimCorp to try to consolidate its systems. Some investors have shown signs of losing faith in the business. Bantleon, a German-based asset manager, has sold down its stake to less than 3 per cent from more than 10 per cent last year. Bantleon declined to comment. However, New York-based investor Global Emerging Markets, one of GAM’s largest shareholders, last month increased its stake in the business to more than 5 per cent. GAM said in January that the board was “constantly reviewing the progress of the firm to ensure that our strategy is appropriate” and that results would be delayed to allow time to provide an update on this strategy.","06.03.2023"
"Letter: Credit Suisse, ‘cocos’ and administering the last rites","From Theo Vermaelen, Professor of Finance, Insead, Fontainebleau, France ","FT Alphaville (March 19) clearly shows why holders of contingent convertible (coco) bonds have reasons to be upset and confused. It says last week Credit Suisse gave a presentation showing a tier one capital ratio of 14 per cent. coco bond investors were reassured as they would only be wiped out if the tier one ratio fell below 7 per cent.  The problem with ratios used by regulators is that they are backward looking, using book values that are completely unrelated to market reality. The book value of equity of SFr35bn was quite different from the market value closer to SFr6bn last Friday. Only when UBS made a takeover bid at an even lower value were regulators forced to accept the reality that the real capital ratio was below 7 per cent.  When coco bonds were introduced they were supposed to improve capital structure management by converting debt into equity when banks got into financial distress. But that assumes distress is measured correctly. As was shown in the 2008 crisis, where Lehman Brothers had perfect capital ratios the day before bankruptcy, capital ratios are poor indicators of financial distress. Coco bonds were designed to be “going concern capital”, but due to their accounting trigger they failed to recapitalise the bank in time. So rather than keeping the bank alive, they are instruments to facilitate a well-structured funeral.  Theo Vermaelen Professor of Finance, Insead Fontainebleau, France ","23.03.2023"
"Dealmaking at 10-year low in first quarter as bank crisis hits confidence","Value of mergers and acquisitions drops 45% year on year to $550.5bn ","Global dealmaking suffered its weakest start to the year in a decade, as a darkening economic outlook depressed activity and a transatlantic banking crisis put the brakes on risk taking. The first quarter of 2023 was the slowest start to the year since 2013 as rising interest rates put an end to the flurry of deals that followed the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the cheap borrowing costs it ushered in.The value of mergers and acquisitions dropped 45 per cent year-on-year to $550.5bn between January and March, the largest decline in the first quarter since 2001, according to data from Refinitiv.  ”The environment for M&A transactions continues to be very challenging,” said Frank Aquila, Sullivan & Cromwell senior M&A partner. “Increasing concerns about the broader economy and the prospect for a recession later this year in the United States has certainly made decision makers hesitant to move forward with transactions in some sectors.”An already slow quarter turned into one of historic tumult in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and the rescue acquisition of Credit Suisse by its local rival UBS. Advisers fear those episodes will further reduce the potential for a rebound in activity, given increased volatility in markets and the risk of a recession in the US later this year.  “The other question on everyone’s mind is if this banking crisis has been avoided or just deferred,” said Naveen Nataraj, co-head of Evercore’s US Advisory business. Europe was the chief laggard this past quarter, with regional deal activity down 63 per cent to $81.6bn, while the US saw a 47 per cent drop to $271.7bn and the Asia-Pacific region only declined by 24 per cent to $134.6bn.  Sectors such as healthcare, technology and industrials were bright spots. Healthcare deals accounted for nearly a fifth of deals, reaching a two-year high in the period, boosted by the top transaction of the quarter — Pfizer’s $43bn acquisition of oncology-focused biotech Seagen.“Big pharma wants move-the-needle assets that are as de-risked as possible,” said Philippe Gallone, a Moelis & Co managing director specialising in healthcare, who warned that there are only a limited number of targets availableIn the shifting market, smaller financial firms have been able to grow market share. While JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs led the rankings for M&A advisers, the smaller Centerview Partners took the third spot in the best showing for a boutique operation in decades.While it has become slightly easier to borrow funding in order to finance deals, buyout firms agreed their lowest value of transactions this quarter since 2020, at $136.1bn.A chief obstacle to transactions remains falling valuations, with companies still hesitant to negotiate deals that would crystallise the reality of lower prices. However, pressure on private equity firms to negotiate deals could lead to a flurry of activity once the market reopens, according to Simona Maellare, global co-head of the alternative capital group at UBS.”If you want to sell, you need to be ready because it will be a traffic jam” when the market reopens, she said.Rising interest rates have also hit the capacity for buyers to finance larger acquisitions. Mid-size transactions have been more resilient, according to bankers.  Still, some corporations and investment firms sought to take advantage of falling prices to make strategic transactions.For example, CVS agreed to acquire primary care centre operator Oak Street Health for $10.6bn billion, a move that will accelerate its push into other parts of the healthcare chain.  “We’re starting to see companies poke their heads up and see if any opportunities may exist,” said Daniel Mendelow, who is co-head of Evercore’s US Advisory business. Private credit groups have continued to play a prominent role in helping finance transactions. Firms including Apollo, Ares and Blackstone are poised to write the largest direct loan on record at $5.5bn to help fund Carlyle’s acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in healthcare analytics company Cotiviti, the FT reported.

Global policymakers are weighing rule changes to better insulate banks from risks such as changing interest rates and a swifter flight of deposits, two factors that fuelled the biggest spate of collapses since the global financial crisis of 2007-08. Among the most high-profile failures, Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in early March, while Credit Suisse was forcibly sold to Swiss rival UBS a week later.  Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements, said that while there was a case for making regulatory “adjustments”, the approach had its limitations because “there is simply no reasonable level of minimum capital and liquidity that can make a bank viable if it has an unsustainable business model or poor governance”.   “The main cause of recent bank crises was the failure of directors and senior managers to fulfil their responsibilities,” he told the European Banking Federation’s annual conference in Brussels on Thursday. “Business models were poor, risk management procedures woefully inadequate and governance lacking.” Carstens, whose institution has responsibility for global financial stability and hosts the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, said those issues “existed well before depositors ran and investors lost confidence” and that many of them should have been “identified and remedied ahead of time”.  “Banking supervision needs to up its game,” he said, arguing that spending must rise “significantly” to help supervisors ensure banks were better run and could cope with the impact of changing interest rates or advances in technology that enable faster bank runs.  Increased spending on regulation could be funded by a “range” of options, including higher contributions from banks. “Some will no doubt complain,” he said. “But this would be money well spent. Financial crises give rise to massive social and financial costs. By reducing their likelihood, investments in a more effective supervisory framework will certainly pay off.”  Carstens did not specify which regions should spend more. Most of 2023’s failures were in midsized US lenders such as Signature Bank and First Republic. The Federal Reserve said supervision of the California-based SVB lacked “sufficient force and urgency” but its implosion was primarily caused by a relaxation of rules during Donald Trump’s presidency, including a change that allowed midsized banks not to set any capital aside for unrealised losses in their securities portfolios.  A recent report by Oliver Wyman found that average supervisory fees paid by US banks are already running at twice the level of fees in the EU, though smaller banks in the European bloc face higher supervisory costs than in the US. An executive at one global bank said large jurisdictions spent substantial amounts on supervision, citing the $2.4bn operational budget of the FDIC. “The question is, are they [regulators] spending money in the right way,” he added.   Carstens called on supervisors to “find and develop sufficient expertise in areas like cyber security, data analytics and artificial intelligence” so they can keep pace with the “far reaching impact of technological disruption” and improve their efficiency.  “With sufficient resources and the aid of technology, supervisors will be able to identify more vulnerabilities at an early stage and to act on them before problems become too large and complex to handle,” he said, adding that “such investments will certainly reduce” the likelihood of bank failures and their ability to destabilise the financial system.","01.06.2023"
"Japanese gaming company suffers $30mn Credit Suisse AT1 bond hit ","Investment decision made by chair Keiko Erikawa, a friend of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son","A Japanese video games maker co-founded by a billionaire sitting on SoftBank’s board has lost $30mn on Credit Suisse bonds wiped out in its rescue by UBS. Koei Tecmo Holdings, a $6bn gaming company, revealed at an earnings briefing on Monday that it had written off ¥4.1bn ($30mn) after the Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bonds it acquired became worthless.  The decision to invest in Credit Suisse bonds was made by Koei Tecmo chair Keiko Erikawa, who has been a friend of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son for four decades and has sat on the board of the Japanese technology conglomerate since 2021.   The Japanese gaming company, known for hits such as Nobunaga’s Ambition and Dynasty Warriors, has never made a loss in its 45 years and has an annual dividend payout ratio of 50 per cent. For the fiscal year that ended in March, Koei Tecmo reported an annual profit of ¥31bn.  But Erikawa, who co-founded the group with her husband, is also famous for managing roughly ¥100bn in its surplus cash and other assets. In a Financial Times interview in 2021, the 74-year-old games designer said she had been investing in stocks since she was 18. A company spokesman said Erikawa was “deeply disappointed” by the AT1 losses but stressed that it still managed to eke out a profit on the non-operating level. Shares rose 2.7 per cent on Tuesday after it released a stronger than expected revenue guidance for the new fiscal year. The exposure of Japanese financial institutions to the $17bn wipeout of Credit Suisse bonds has been limited, with the government saying last week that about ¥140bn of the Swiss lender’s AT1 bonds were sold in Japan. The most exposed has been Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, which sold about ¥95bn of the bonds to domestic retail and corporate clients. Last week Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group sold ¥140bn in AT1 bonds, marking the first issuance of the debt by a big bank since the Credit Suisse turmoil. The bonds are a type of risky bank debt that can be converted into equity or written down to zero if a lender’s capital falls below a certain level. They were introduced by regulators after the global financial crisis to ensure that bondholders would absorb some of the losses in the event of bank failures to help shield depositors and avoid taxpayer-funded bailouts.

"Investors slash expectations of global interest rate rises after banking turmoil","Markets now bet US, Canada and Brazil will cut borrowing costs before the autumn ","Investors have scaled back their expectations of global interest rate rises in the aftermath of banking sector turmoil, with market indicators suggesting that the period of rapid increases has come to an abrupt end. The pricing of derivatives products, such as interest rate swaps, indicates investors believe many of world’s major central banks will not raise rates further and, in some cases, will begin to impose cuts before the end of the year.  “Global interest rates are near a peak,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The suddenly fragile global banking system is putting pressure on central banks to end their rate hikes sooner rather than later.”  Swaps rates now suggest the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and seven other major central banks are all now expected to keep rates on hold at their next meetings. Markets are split on whether the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will raise rates in May, after pricing in a high probability of a rise at the start of March.   ‘We’ve had one of the most aggressive rate hiking cycles in decades, followed by banking turmoil and now peak rates are firmly on the horizon,” said Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown. The reappraisal comes after one of the sharpest tightening cycles in recent history. Over the past six months, 18 major central banks have increased rates by a total of 16.45 percentage points. Just a fortnight ago, the peak in global interest rates had looked further away.  In early March, investors had expected the federal funds rate target range to rise as high as between 5.5 per cent and 5.75 per cent by December, from its current range of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent. The shift in derivatives pricing signals markets now expect the range to be around 4 per cent by then.  At the start of this month, investors had expected the European Central Bank’s deposit rate to hit 4 per cent towards the end of the year – up from its current level of 3 per cent. They now anticipate a deposit rate of 3 per cent by then. The expectation for the Bank of England’s bank rate towards the end of the year has gone from around 4.75 per cent at the beginning of March to around 4.25 per cent as of Monday.   “The major central banks, including the Fed and the ECB, should make a joint statement that any further rate hike is off the table at least until stability has returned to the financial markets,” said Erik Nielsen, chief economics adviser at UniCredit Bank.   Last week, the Fed, Bank of England and Norway’s central bank all raised rates by a quarter percentage point. The Swiss National Bank went for a half-point rise despite the rescue-takeover of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS, and the ECB did the same the previous week.  However, policymakers in most of those banks have signalled that a further rise in borrowing costs depends on turmoil in the banking system abating.  “You can think of [the turmoil] as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that,” said Fed chair Jay Powell last Wednesday, signalling the panic could do rate-setters’ job for them.  “Because of stressful conditions, banks become less willing to lend and they’re going to lend often by increasing the interest rate,” said Costas Milas, a professor at Liverpool university.  UBS forecasts that, by the end of 2023, more than half of the 32 central banks it tracks will have lowered their policy rates. Another seven will have left them unchanged.  However, some economists remain concerned high inflation will force lenders to keep on raising rates.   Zandi said signs inflation will prove persistent could mean central banks would “sacrifice their economies to get inflation back to their targets”. Inflation figures for the US and eurozone are due out on Friday.   Some rate-setters in Latin America and eastern Europe have kept interest rates on hold for months. “Central banks in emerging markets were some of the first to react to rising inflation and hike rates, and still may be the first to embark on a rate cutting cycle,” said Streeter. The market for interest rate swaps is one of the world’s largest derivatives markets. The gross value of outstanding interest rate derivatives rose significantly over the first half of 2022 in response to central banks’ rate rises, according to Bank for International Settlements data.

"Bank of Japan policy shift risks causing eurozone bond turmoil, warns ECB","Japanese investors could retreat if BoJ ends its ultra-loose monetary policy","Eurozone bond markets are at risk of a sell-off caused by a sudden retreat of Japanese investors if the Bank of Japan ends its ultra-loose monetary policy, the European Central Bank has warned. “If the Bank of Japan decides to normalise its policy, this might influence the decisions of Japanese investors who have a large footprint in global financial markets, including the euro area bond market,” the ECB said in its twice-yearly financial stability review published on Wednesday. The ECB said the risk of “Japanese investors withdrawing abruptly from the euro area bond market” was among the myriad possible threats to the eurozone financial system, while it judged the bloc to be largely resilient even after the recent banking turmoil in the US and Switzerland.  The fallout from a potential policy shift in Japan would be accentuated for eurozone debt markets because it would coincide with the ECB starting to shrink its own bond holdings this year, the Frankfurt-based institution said. Japan’s central bank recently signalled the first step in unwinding its ultra-loose monetary policy by ditching its forward guidance that interest rates would remain at or below current levels after inflation in the country rose at the fastest rate in four decades. Japanese investors have significant holdings in eurozone government bonds, particularly French debt, as well as vast investments in US Treasuries and Australian bonds.  The ECB said normalisation of Japanese monetary policy could lead to “a rapid decline in rate differentials and increased exchange rate volatility”, which it said could “reduce the attractiveness” of carry trades — in which investors borrow at low rates in Japan to invest in higher-yielding bonds abroad. Higher Japanese rates could prompt investors to repatriate money, it said, while “valuation losses on local bond portfolios and higher risk-free rates could inhibit the investors’ risk-seeking behaviour, including their willingness to invest abroad”. Luis de Guindos, ECB vice-president, said its own recent policy tightening — including a 3.75 percentage point rise in its deposit rate since last summer — “can reveal vulnerabilities in the financial system”.  He said it was “critical” to monitor such threats, including falling commercial property prices, higher borrowing costs for governments and banks, increasing bankruptcies, and lower liquidity in financial markets. These increased risks, coupled with mounting uncertainty over the economy, made it even more important for political leaders to “fully implement the banking union” in the single currency bloc by introducing a common deposit guarantee scheme, he said. Banks in the eurozone had “proved resilient” to the collapse of several US banks and the crisis at Credit Suisse that forced it into the arms of its rival UBS, the ECB said, pointing to “strong capital and liquidity” positions among the region’s lenders. But it warned that there were signs of a deterioration in the credit quality of loans on banks’ balance sheets as higher borrowing costs, weak growth and high inflation triggered a rise in insolvencies. “Banks may therefore need to set aside more funds to cover losses and manage their credit risks,” it added. Property markets in the eurozone “are undergoing a correction”, the ECB said. Recent house price falls had been “orderly so far”, but it warned that if demand continued to be hit by rising mortgage costs this could become “disorderly”. The downturn in commercial property markets “could test the resilience of investment funds”, it added.","31.05.2023"
"Meet the pizza-loving diplomat behind Antigua News’s big Credit Suisse scoop","Flamboyant owner of obscure website claims files were “absolutely not secret”","A bombshell twist in the saga of Credit Suisse’s $17bn additional tier 1 writedown hit the headlines this week, when mainFT sort-of revealed the following: Credit Suisse directly disputed the Swiss financial regulator’s basis for writing down $17bn of its additional tier 1 bonds, in a private letter aimed at sparing staff bonuses that were tied to the debt. We say “sort-of” because, while the FT was the first major news organisation to write about the revelations contained in a second decree Switzerland’s Finma issued ordering Credit Suisse to zero its AT1 bonds, another lesser-known media outfit actually got the scoop: The second decree was published in full online last week by Antigua News, a local news outlet. The Financial Times separately obtained a copy of the decree and verified its authenticity with several people with direct knowledge of the situation. If you are not familiar with Antigua News, you are not alone.   The barely two-year-old website primarily traffics in the comings and goings on the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, with recent stories chronicling a robbery at local takeaway joint Roti King and the suspension of a high-profile criminal trial due to a courtroom “mould infestation”. Even by the standards of a local news start-up, Antigua News’s Twitter presence was minimal, with a paltry 15 followers ahead of the FT’s story on Monday:  Antigua? We hardly know ’er Needless to say, obscure Caribbean websites do not usually break big European banking stories. For those not following the intricacies of the fallout from Credit Suisse’s shotgun marriage to UBS, earlier this month a group of AT1 bondholders that have banded together to sue Finma achieved an early victory in what is expected to be a protracted courtroom battle. The aggrieved investors forced the Swiss financial regulator to hand over two hitherto secret documents: Finma’s decree ordering Credit Suisse to wipe out the AT1 bonds and a second decree relating to staff bonuses that were tied to the debt.  While aspects of the first decree soon leaked out into the Swiss press, the world’s media had missed that Finma had even issued a second decree before Antigua News arrived on the scene.   The contents of this second decree were even more explosive. The document reveals Credit Suisse had challenged Finma’s interpretation of the AT1 contracts and argued that the conditions allowing for a writedown had not been met. It represents a coup for investors battling to prove that Finma acted improperly. On May 15th, hours after muckraking Swiss financial blog Inside Paradeplatz published an article containing a couple of photographed extracts from copies of the first decree, Antigua News quietly published digital versions of both the first and second decrees in their entirety. It even savvily watermarked them:  FT Alphaville set out to find out how this little-known Antiguan website got hold of the Swiss smoking gun and scooped the world’s financial press.  The answer led us to a pizza-loving lawyer and ambassador, whose notable past clients include Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law.  Caribbean websurfing destination Antigua News had published two articles on Credit Suisse’s travails in March, as the 167-year-old lender fell into the arms of longtime rival UBS. These earlier stories at least carried a byline (“Tata”), but lacked the strength of sourcing of the later marmalade-dropper dispatch. While the owner of the antigua.news domain had used a privacy protection service, online records also suggested a Swiss connection:  The website itself is . . . not user friendly. Vast sections of screen space are covered by large invisible link frames, which make right-clicking impossible.  Some gentle fiddling allowed Alphaville to circumvent these barriers and access the raw images of the Finma decrees. File names such as “FITMA 1.pdf.jpg” suggested not only a slight sloppiness arising from an eagerness to get content online (we can relate), but also that the poster had a digital version of the document itself.  As much as we love a spot of online archaeology, at this point we decided it would be more efficient to hit the phones.  Unexpected Item in bagholding area A Swiss lawyer, Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to Spain, and a fledgling media mogul walks into a bar. His name is Dario Item. “This is my article, I wrote the article on Antigua News,” Item told FTAV. “I am also [the owner] of Antigua News. And I am also a Swiss lawyer . . . I am defending some investors and for this reason, I have this information.” We happened upon the rather forthcoming man behind the scoop while cold calling phone numbers connected to Antigua News (it was more successful than our earlier exchange with a slightly bemused advertising sales representative who had not heard of Credit Suisse, but dutifully promised to pass on our inquiry all the same). Item, 50, is the Antiguan ambassador not only to Spain, but also the small European principalities of Monaco and Liechtenstein, and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. His embassy owns and operates Antigua News. He is also a lawyer based in Lugano, Switzerland, representing undisclosed investors holding Credit Suisse AT1s, which were wiped out during the sale to UBS. “You understand it’s a big scandal in Switzerland,” he told us. “We are all very upset because we sincerely believe that there [was] no legal basis at all in order to write down the AT1s.”  (Item declined to name the investors he is representing, citing “attorney-client privilege”.) In possession of both the decrees and Antigua News (which he called an “official channel of the embassy of Antigua and Barbuda in Madrid”), Item decided to cut out the middleman: he effectively supplied the documents to himself, posting them alongside an explanation of their significance on the news website he controls via his diplomatic post. His account of the big scoop was confirmed by the unnamed journalist who oversees Antigua News’s WhatsApp group, who also suggested that their hands-on proprietor has a similarly direct editorial philosophy as that professed by the London Evening Standard’s Lord Lebedev:   (The anonymous journalist had also seen our snarky tweet about Antigua News’s paltry number of Twitter followers, cheerfully flagging that their Facebook account is far more popular as “Islanders hardly use Twitter”. Fair point!) Item explained that he was the man for the job when it came to writing about the complexities of the legal case surrounding Credit Suisse’s AT1s because it is “a very sensitive matter.” “I have the competencies to write an article like that,” he said. “And I decided to do it because I believe it’s very important.” It’s certainly a novel approach to journalism. The FT’s other sources close to the case have been more circumspect about sharing documents from the ongoing litigation. Item has no such qualms. “These documents are absolutely not secret,” he told us, adding that the Swiss court that compelled Finma to disclose the decrees to bondholders did not place “any restrictions” on publishing them. “This is very, very important. People have to know. With all details.” Mr Worldwide A one-minute-31-second clip, titled “Dario Item”, is one of three videos on the YouTube channel “Dario Item”. The other two are called “Dario Item” and “Dario Item”. It shows Felipe VI of Spain stood in the Antechamber of Charles III, part of the royal palace in Madrid. Item enters from a far door, and formally presents his credentials to Felipe. The scene is also documented on Item’s Instagram, where he primarily posts beach pictures and has north of 800,000 followers. These are but a couple of examples of Item’s sprawling web presence, which, alongside Antigua News, also includes a personal website, another personal website, another personal website, a personal press website, another personal press website, and a Medium profile. Here he is promoting Antigua and Barbuda’s blockchain regulation. And here he is mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II in the Scottish local press. Here he is writing about money laundering in Switzerland. Item also repeatedly comes up in relation to Antigua’s “Nomad Digital Residence” programme, which allows foreigners to live and work remotely from Antigua and Barbuda for up to two years. Last summer, Item announced the scheme had been “cautiously reopen[ed]” for “non-sanctioned Russians and Belarusians”, subject to “strict criteria”. We also noticed that Russian is one of the handful of language options on many of Item’s myriad websites. The ambassador confirmed to us that his Russian websites were his way of promoting Antigua’s citizenship by investment programme in the country and the surrounding region. He added that “unfortunately” the window for Russian and Belarusian applicants closed again just one month after his big announcement.  Putin-adjacent clients There are other Russia-related Item items around. In 2020, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a consortium of investigative journalists, named Item in connection with a network of offshore companies owned by Kirill Shamalov, Russian president Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law. It labelled Item the “main custodian of Shamalov’s offshore secrets”. Item branded this claim “really ridiculous”, noting he was one of several lawyers that worked for Shamalov.  “And every lawyer is custodian of secrets,” he told us. “By the way, the case was related to a Swiss bank and considering Switzerland as [an] offshore country [is] simply ridiculous. I was just a lawyer, but it was five years ago.” It is not the only Putin-adjacent story we found. This 2014 Reuters report included documents from a company called Medea Investment, which supplied materials to the notorious Black Sea-adjacent property dubbed “Putin’s Palace”. The document names “Dr. Dario Item” of Lugano, Switzerland, as a representative for Medea. Reuters reported the company’s shareholder was Lanfranco Cirillo, an Italian architect best known for designing the mansion allegedly constructed for the Russian President’s enjoyment.  Item said his work for Cirillo was “in the past” and claimed client-attorney privilege again prevented him from discussing details. Then there was his run in with the financial authorities in Labuan, a federal territory of Malaysia, which in 2019 struck off Item as a director of two financial services firms. As a consequence of the regulatory sanction, Antigua also revoked one of his companies’ banking licenses. The Malaysian regulator later overturned the personal sanction against Item, following a judicial review. “I was — you can believe me or not — I was the victim of a fraudster,” said Item. “I won in court and there is nothing left in that country [Malaysia]. Every measure against me has been withdrawn and this is public.” Crusted adviser We thought this story was weird and wonderful enough. Then we found the pizza forum.  Among his other interests, Item owns a messaging board for pizza enthusiasts, La Verace, where he posts as an admin under the name Napoli72. One of the other pizza aficionados even affectionately refers to him as “Zio Dario” (“Uncle Dario”). Zio Dario has posted 4,635 times. Here’s his signature (translated by Google):  “It’s my passion. It’s my passion. Absolutely. It’s absolutely my passion. I love cooking. I love cooking,” Item told FTAV. He added: “And I have a pizza oven in all my houses, also here in Antigua. I am a bit crazy to be honest.” A commitment to making high-quality homemade pizzas didn’t seem that out there for a man of Item’s means. But he then began detailing the delicate logistics involved.  “You can’t imagine how difficult it was to bring an oven from Naples,” Item continued with a chuckle, explaining how he had to use a crane to install the traditional forno. “If you saw what I did here, you definitely could conclude that I am crazy.” While FTAV wouldn’t go that far, it is certainly illustrative of the same can-do approach that led the international lawyer and diplomat to take matters into his own hands when the world’s financial press missed the real story on Credit Suisse.","24.05.2023"
"Charles Schwab feels heat after SVB collapse","Broker was already under pressure from customers reacting to higher interest rates","Charles Schwab is battling to allay fears about interest rates and unrealised losses after the brokerage’s shares fell 40 per cent following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Shares in Schwab, which is the largest brokerage in the US, with $7.4tn in client assets, have fallen further and faster than its rivals, such as Interactive Brokers, in the wake of SVB’s failure. Schwab’s shares jumped 9.2 per cent on Tuesday after billionaire fund manager Ron Baron “marginally increased” his less than 1 per cent investment in the firm and as US financial stocks surged following promises from regulators to protect depositors.  But investors remain concerned about the broker’s unrealised losses on assets such as Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities — which were close to $28bn at the end of 2022. The rapid collapse of SVB has focused attention on the risks of having to sell assets at a markdown in a rising-interest rate environment. It also caught groups such as Schwab off guard at a point when they are already under pressure from customers reacting to higher rates. “Schwab hasn’t been hit by people afraid that Schwab is going to go out of business, but they’ve been hit by [customers] going to higher rates,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Piper Sandler. Rather than lending out client funds, Schwab automatically “sweeps” customer cash deposits into bank accounts and invests those assets into secure, long-dated securities. Cash has surged into Schwab since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. By the end of February 2023, it held more than $500bn in interest-earning cash deposits on its platform, down 20 per cent from the end of 2021. But rising interest rates have pushed investors to move cash into better yielding accounts, such as money market funds. The shift, called “cash sorting”, has resulted in about $43bn moving out of Schwab cash accounts in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to Piper Sandler.  Inflows into money market funds at Schwab averaged $1.4bn a day in the first week of March, according to JPMorgan. The rate of cash sorting will probably exceed the rate of the maturing assets held by Schwab’s bank — only about $32bn are expected to mature this year, according to JPMorgan. In order to fund the withdrawals into money market accounts, Schwab has had to borrow money at a higher cost, such as from the Federal Home Loan Banks, which will probably continue and hit the broker’s bottom line, analysts said. UBS expects Schwab earnings in 2023 to fall 20 per cent from 2022 because of the increased cost of borrowing. “It’s a real headwind,” said Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS. He added that because this information was made available last month, the recent sell-off was likely down to frightened investors cutting banks with large unrealised losses out of their portfolios. The broker on Monday issued a statement following a release of flows data from February, emphasising that 80 per cent of the company’s bank deposits were within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurable limit. “Looking at unrealised losses among [held to maturity] securities, but not doing the same for traditional banks’ loan portfolios, the analysis penalises firms like Schwab that in fact have a higher quality, more liquid, and more transparent balance sheet,” Schwab said in a statement.  Outflows of Schwab’s cash deposits have been ongoing since April 2022, after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, before intensifying in the past week. Schwab said it believed it was nearing the end of the majority of customers sorting their cash into money market funds.  In late January, Peter Crawford, Schwab’s chief financial officer, said it was “entering the later innings” of the flows from cash deposits to money market accounts, on which it charges fees, and expected it to abate by the end of the year. Most brokerages have sweep accounts, but Schwab is the largest broker, with a relatively affluent customer base. It has the largest average account size of any brokerage of its size, at more than $200,000, according to data from BrokerChooser. But Schwab’s investor base was more diversified, and less likely to move at the scale that SVB’s did, said Repetto at Piper Sandler. “They’re not Silicon Valley investors or companies, they’re the little guy putting money in.”","14.03.2023"
"BT Pension Scheme seeks to invest in private credit sector","UK’s largest corporate retirement plan wants to take advantage of banks’ growing reluctance to lend","The £40bn BT Pension Scheme is aiming to invest in private credit as the UK’s largest corporate retirement plan joins the trend in the sector of funds seeking to take advantage of banks’ growing reluctance to lend. Rising interest rates over the past 15 months have led to banks reining in their lending, opening up opportunities for institutional investors such as pension schemes to step into the funding gap. Wyn Francis, chief investment officer at Brightwell, the investment manager for the BT Pension Scheme, told the Financial Times that the fund was looking to take advantage of the changing lending climate as it continued its move away from equities.  “I see an opportunity in the next 18 months to deploy [capital into private credit] if the anticipated tightening through central bank policy transmits into the market,” he added. “Private credit has stepped in and I’m expecting this to accelerate,” Francis said on the sidelines of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association conference in Edinburgh. “So, in other words, as it becomes more difficult in the traditional lending market, this then plays into some of the private credit managers.” Since the 2008 financial crisis, private credit has become an increasingly important source of finance for small businesses across the globe. Private credit managers provided an estimated $127bn worth of loans in 2021, up 20 per cent on the year before, according to the Alternative Credit Council, which represents businesses in the private credit and direct lending sectors. A move into private credit would be part of the BT scheme’s plan to secure retirement payments through so-called cash-flow matching, an approach that seeks to match expected returns from investments with expected payouts to pensioners in a defined benefit scheme. The BT pension plan, which closed to new entrants in 2001 and has 275,000 members, is at present paying out about £2.5bn a year to current pensioners. “Our ambition is to build our cash-flow matching portfolio by 2034, which is when all of our members will move from savers to pensioners and be drawing income,” Francis said. “We find that private credit gives us not just the cash flow generation, but there’s also a risk premium in there. That works for us.”   To meet its objective, he said the plan would consider investing in “anything with a contractual income”, such as real estate or bonds, in addition to private credit.  He declined to put a figure on the potential scale of investment in private credit but said it could become “significant” as the fund sold off assets that were not cash-flow matching. “If you assume that we need to be cash-flow matched by 2034 . . . we are around a little bit over 50 per cent of that at the moment,” he said. “But the buildout needs to come over a number of years.” Francis said the scheme did not intend to become a direct lender, but would invest in private credit funds. The BT fund’s strategy comes as other global investors seek to increase their exposure to private debt following the recent upheavals in the banking sector, including the collapse of Signature Bank and First Republic in the US and the sale of Credit Suisse to its Swiss rival UBS this year. Calpers, the biggest public pension plan in the US, said last month that “there are opportunities it could pursue” based on current tightening in the banking industry.  The US Federal Reserve last month warned of a “sharp contraction” in credit. Big private capital companies such as Blackstone, Apollo Global Management and KKR have been exploring ways to increase their exposure to private credit. Francis stressed, however, that there were “liquidity risks in private credit” for investors. “I think it’s really important for anyone who wants to invest to build a diversified portfolio,” he said. “Diversification is your friend.”","08.06.2023"

Marc FilippinoThe hearing comes as US authorities are asking ByteDance to sell its stake in the US arm of the company. Here’s the FT’s Hannah Murphy on what Shou Zi Chew told lawmakers. Hannah MurphySo, look, he tried to reassure them repeatedly that their fears that TikTok might be weaponised by the Chinese Communist party for espionage purposes, for propaganda purposes, were unwarranted. That, in fact, ByteDance and TikTok are very separate entities, and that he stressed repeatedly: TikTok has invested in this new partnership with Oracle called Project Texas, which will sort of ensure that American user data is kept in the US, stored in the US, safe in the US, and away from any potential Chinese interference. Marc FilippinoSo did any of the lawmakers buy it? Hannah MurphyNot at all, really. None of the congress people seemed convinced. Many of them pushed back and said so quite bluntly. I think they still think that Beijing’s hold over TikTok is all pervasive, all invasive, and that whatever TikTok says it’s doing, there will be back doors and ways in which China can still compel the company to hand over US user data. Marc FilippinoAnd what has the Chinese government said, Hannah? Hannah MurphyThey’ve come out and said they would firmly oppose a forced sale of TikTok, the US arm. Beijing has certain export laws that it can wield to try to prevent a sale, in particular of TikTok’s coveted algorithm technology. You know, that automatically serves the videos that users want to see. That’s really sort of the gold, the treasure that China wants to keep and protect. So that leaves TikTok, obviously, between a rock and a hard place. You have US authorities calling for divestment. At the same time, there’s China saying, no, we won’t allow it. And then between that stalemate, you now have many US politicians calling for a ban in the US where it has 150mn users.  Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s technology correspondent, Hannah Murphy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hindenburg Research is going after its next big target. The New York-based firm announced that it’s been investigating the payments group Block and has shorted the company’s stock. Basically, they bet the company’s share price would fall. This comes just two months after it did the same thing to Indian conglomerate Adani Group. The FT’s Ortenca Aliaj is with me to unpack why Hindenburg is targeting Block now. Hi, Ortenca. Ortenca AliajHi. Marc FilippinoOK, so Hindenburg’s short on Block worked. It came out with this report yesterday, and Block’s share price dropped 14 per cent over the course of the day. But what exactly is Hindenburg alleging? Ortenca AliajHindenburg Research has made the allegation that Block, which is the payments group founded by the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, of artificially inflating its user numbers and facilitating fraudulent transactions. It claims in the report that Cash App, which is one of the sort of key growth areas for Block, has been used by criminal gangs to make payments. And one of the sort of things that it cites in support of this is this two-minute compilation video it has made where rappers rap about using the Cash App to pay for drugs or to offer people.  [LAUGHTER. RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Rapper 1 . . . a move without Cash App. Cash App. Cash App. Rapper 2My Cash App because I send a thousand transactions. I just bought another phone and made a cash app. The ATM limit was to 50. I got a cash back . . .  Rapper 3And now junkie with it . . .  Ortenca AliajIt’s an interesting way. You know, most short sellers will, will put out a report and it has sort of gone the extra mile on this one. Marc FilippinoOK. So how has Block responded to all this? Ortenca AliajBlock has denied the allegations, and they have said that they are going to work with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pursue legal action against Hindenburg. Marc FilippinoWhat would that look like, Ortenca? Ortenca AliajThe SEC has, of course, been looking at short seller actions. I don’t think Hindenburg has publicly been named as part of the investigation that is being conducted by regulators. But there’s always this weird dynamic in being a short seller because you kind of already know what’s gonna happen in the market after you release your report. And nine times out of 10, if you’re a well-respected short seller like Hindenburg is, the share price will go down and you can close that position and you know that you will have a material effect on a company’s share price. So a lot of people who don’t like short sellers, namely shareholders and CEOs of public companies, often say this is market manipulation because you can effectively, quote unquote, “front-run” what’s going to happen. I think that has been something that the SEC has been looking at from reports that we’ve seen. But I’m not sure that Jack Dorsey or that Block itself can push the SEC to look into this. Marc FilippinoOrtenca Aliaj is the FT’s mergers and acquisitions correspondent. Thanks, Ortenca. Ortenca AliajThank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc FilippinoThere are a lot of different angles to the UBS-Credit Suisse deal that are being uncovered. Some details are mundane, others are completely out of left field, like how Bear Grylls is involved in all this. Kaye WigginsFor people who haven’t heard of him, I guess he’s a kind of explorer adventurer who’s become pretty famous through his TV shows that he’s been on, why he’s sort of surviving in difficult environments. Marc FilippinoBear Grylls of the TV show Running Wild with Bear Grylls is speaking at a Credit Suisse conference this week in Hong Kong about navigating harsh environments. Kaye couldn’t go because Credit Suisse cut off media access, but her sources told her some pretty juicy details about it. Kaye WigginsThe very same weekend that their bosses were in crisis talks about the bank’s very existence. This group of Credit Suisse executives in Hong Kong, you know, they were camping and they were filming their exploits as part of this programme of events that Bear Grylls was involved with at the conference. Marc FilippinoNot a great look, especially because the conference is being held in Hong Kong. Investors in Asia lost big when UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse’s $17bn of AT1, or additional tier 1, bonds were wiped out when the deal hit. And a lot of AT1 investors are based in Asia. Kaye WigginsIn other parts of the world, retail investors either just don’t tend to go for these types of instruments or in some places, including in the UK, they’re actually barred from holding them. So, you know, in the US and in Europe, these bonds are often owned by institutional investors rather than retail or kind of high-net-worth individuals. So yeah, it’s kind of a feature of how things work in parts of Asia that actually retail investors or rich individuals and wealthy families tend to hold these. Marc FilippinoSo when people found out that the UBS-Credit Suisse deal would render their AT1 bonds worthless, it was a real punch to the gut. Kaye WigginsSpoke to one private banker who said they hadn’t slept in days because they were just fielding calls from people who were asking, “What’s going on here?” They said the people that they had been talking to were completely gobsmacked about how these instruments could turn out to be so risky. Marc FilippinoIn the wake of all this, sources told the FT that major banks in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong are placing new AT1 bond deals on hold until market conditions stabilise. But if that hold lifts, will there still be an appetite for them? Kaye WigginsI think it will certainly have an effect on these AT1s, on sentiment towards them more generally, which isn’t necessarily the right response because the thing with these bonds is it all depends on how regulators would act in a crisis. And several other regulators have said that the way that things played out with Credit Suisse wouldn’t happen in other jurisdictions. So it’s not necessarily the case that if a different bank went bust in a different jurisdiction, then the equity holders would get some money back and the AT1 holders wouldn’t. But still, I think it has made people a lot more cautious about this and a lot more potentially a bit more predisposed to read the small print of the documents that explains what they’re actually investing in.

"The Lex Newsletter: is H100 a ‘god chip’ or a Doomsday device?","Plus, OpenAI, Lenovo, Meta, Greenhill, Credit Suisse","This article is an on-site version of The Lex Newsletter. Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader,  Thanks. No, really, I think you’re tremendous. Don’t blush. A lot more of you are reading this newsletter than before. And you said things that were either flattering or helpfully critical in a recent survey. I mean it all sincerely because I am a human being, not a generative artificial intelligence program (yet). This also meant I assimilated the biggest business story of the week — Nvidia’s doubling of forecast AI revenues — with a complex mix of rationalisation and emotion.  Shares in Nvidia rose 25 per cent, or $190bn for a total market capitalisation of $940bn. This is a far cry from a crash in the stock last year that left chief executive Jensen Huang with “actually paid remuneration” of minus $4mn under bewildering US disclosure rules. The cause of all the excitement is the US chipmaker’s H100 chipset. This has 80bn transistors. You need a lot of switches for AI functions such as “natural language processing”. This involves assimilating vast amounts of text and parsing its interconnections so a sophisticated chatbot can answer questions competently. Tech types have waffled for years about a putative “god chip” so fast and efficient it supersedes the rest. The H100 has, for the moment, achieved that functionality for AI development. Could elaborations of H100 be “god chips” in a different sense? Could they create AIs indistinguishable from living humans during remote communication? If so, they would have aced the Turing test, an epochal development envisaged by the great codebreaker Alan Turing. Post-Turing AI would have huge potential for good and ill. The movie Blade Runner played with the idea that synthetic people would be a threat to the genuine article. It featured a kind of reverse Turing test, which identified the fakes from their lack of empathy. The modern analogy of their corporate creator is OpenAI. This US organisation began life as a non-profit determined to lead the way in responsible AI development. But steep development costs nudged it to create a “capped profit” arm.  Lex predicts that OpenAI’s need for fresh capital will stop it imposing caps on the returns investors can make.  My expectation is that AI developers will increasingly prioritise profit-seeking over social responsibility. That will leave slow-moving politicians and regulators to deal with negative consequences once the genie is out of the bottle. Unlike some pessimists, I don’t think computers will destroy humanity. We’re perfectly capable of doing that unaided. Please let me know what you think at Lexfeedback@ft.com. Down home on the (server) farm Mature technology seems so rustic in comparison to AI that I’m tempted to put my foot up on a gate and chew a straw while discussing it.  The cash cow in view is the laptop computer. The end is nigh for this device, we believe, following in the wake of desktop computers. Lenovo of China missed its earnings forecasts on Wednesday. Shipments of PCs of all kinds are slumping. Sales of tablets and their ilk are soaring.  Peripherals — speakers, keyboards and mice — are safer places for investors than old-style computer manufacturing. We were intrigued that Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF has suffered net outflows of $19mn this year despite the share price rising 29 per cent. Our theory is that investors simply do not believe punchy predictions for Big Tech when further rate rises are possible. Tougher regulation is another problem for Big Tech. The EU fined Meta €1.2bn this week for breaching data protection laws. Like many tech groups, the owner of Facebook relied on “standardised contractual clauses” between its US and European entities to comply with data protection rules. Not good enough, the EU said. Meta has also chalked up a $260mn loss on the forced sale of animated image search engine Giphy. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority had barred the original acquisition. The tech war between Europe and US is a low-intensity undeclared conflict. The battle between China and the US is vigorous and highly visible. Lex characterises it as “two heavily armoured knights biffing each other with yard brooms”. The latest wallop was delivered by China, which has banned its big infrastructure operators from buying memory chips from Micron. This is a drag for the US chip group, which relies on China for just under a fifth of sales. But the move also looks like self-inflicted damage for China, whose chip deficit is growing.  China’s weakness in chips contrasts with its strength in another silicon-based product, photovoltaic cells. Low labour costs, state subsidies and a big domestic market have helped Chinese manufacturers such as Longi Green Technology and JA Solar to trounce European rivals  Chinese manufacturers do not make great profits, though. There is too much pressure on them from Beijing to keep prices low in the push to decarbonise. Indeed, installation growth threatens to exceed energy demand and storage capacity by a wide margin.  Lex believes similar drivers will leave China heavily dominant in electric vehicle battery supply, a thought that would dismay US and European manufacturers. A Greenhill far astray On Wall Street, franchise erosion tends to come from a new business nearby rather than one on the other side of the world. A couple of stories highlighted the issue this week: the merger of corporate law firm Shearman & Sterling with UK rival Allen & Overy; and the purchase of investment bank Greenhill by Mizuho Financial of Japan. As a Brit, I was not familiar with Shearman, which sounds like an invention of the Mad Men scripting huddle. A better-informed Lex colleague in New York explained that the firm had lost its way following the financial crisis. This diminished the role of traditional investment clients, even as private capital businesses burgeoned.  It was a similar story at Greenhill. Its shares hit an all-time high after rivals Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns went under. But it was out-competed by upstarts such as Evercore and Moelis, who relied a little less on a few superstar bankers. Franchise value is also a big issue in the aftermath of recent banking turmoil. First Citizens, which bought defunct Silicon Valley Bank, is suing HSBC, which snapped up SVB’s UK unit. The US regional lender alleges that the Asia-focused giant improperly attempted to hire 40 top SVB bankers. First Citizens chalked up a $10bn net asset windfall when it rescued SVB. But it was evidently also counting on an intangible gain on the employment contracts of those bankers too. In the same way, UBS needs to hang on to Credit Suisse’s best wealth managers. The sweetener that encouraged UBS to buy its struggling rival — the wipeout of $17bn of additional tier one bonds has doubtless infuriated some of them. Credit Suisse executives are planning to sue regulator Finma because their bonuses mirrored the value of the AT1s Switzerland’s decision to upturn the capital hierarchy at Credit Suisse hangs round its neck like a putrescent albatross. Stuff I have enjoyed this week I was intrigued by this report from FT colleagues Kenza Bryan and Joe Daniels about debt-for-nature swaps. The UK’s Legal & General is switching $250mn of Ecuadorean debt for promises to protect the Galápagos. Darwin’s theory of natural selection is canonically attributed to insights gained there. His voyage on HMS Beagle also inspired him to predict the extinction of kangaroos, which he saw as hopelessly uncompetitive. A person can’t get it right all the time. I also enjoyed this justification of why the west should supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter aircraft from retired Air Marshal Edward Stringer. And I was moved by the FT’s obituary of the incredible Tina Turner. I have given up reading Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. I confess I only got to p634 of a 1,500-page edition. Here, the Romans Christianised and became a lot less entertaining. But we have a long weekend ahead, so perhaps you can get further with it.

"Derivatives market still hit by fallout from Ion Markets cyber attack","Incident has left exchanges and regulators unable to compile weekly reports of trading activity","Business has yet to return to normal in global derivatives trading, three weeks after a cyber attack on Ion Markets, underlining the financial technology group’s significant role in the plumbing of the $1tn market.  Little-known Ion was targeted by attackers at the end of January, who disabled part of its derivatives systems and forced many trading desks to manually keep track of their data on spreadsheets.  The Dublin-based company is aiming to restore business as usual and transfer all clients to clean systems this week, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ion declined to comment.  The disruption has rattled the global futures market, which has relied on automated software produced by companies such as Ion to process trades ever since the boisterous paper-littered trading pits gave way to electronic systems. Ion is one of the few companies that handles the complex but critical job of matching and reconciling brokers’ trades. The hack has left exchanges and markets regulators unable to compile weekly reports of derivatives trading activity and scrambling for workarounds to log their daily activity in one of the world’s biggest financial markets. There were just over $1tn of equity, commodity and interest rate futures open in December, according to data from the Futures Industry Association. “This was a high-profile attack,” said John Rapa, chief executive of derivatives industry consultancy Tellefsen. “This is a large, critical vendor, who many participants in the business use.” As Ion rebuilds its software on to new hardware and moves customers to clean systems, the three-week delay has resulted in trading firms and regulators paying greater attention to the risks to daily trading operations of a single point of failure. Ion was founded in 1999 and has built an empire by scooping up dozens of specialist trading technology groups through a series of debt-fuelled acquisitions. Its founder and chief executive, Andrea Pignataro, a former bond trader at Salomon Brothers, avoids the spotlight.   On January 31, Ion confirmed market rumours that it had suffered a cyber attack in a part of its business where futures trades are matched and margin is calculated — the insurance that backs a derivatives trade — according to people familiar with the matter. “It’s made things a lot more manual . . . checking everything line by line,” said one person familiar with the situatIon. RBC, UBS and Macquarie were among the firms affected, according to people familiar with the matter. RBC declined to comment. UBS and Macquarie did not respond to requests for comment. “The impact is huge because the recovery time is usually not quick,” said Martin Greenfield, chief executive of cyber security company Quod Orbis. “In most banking terms that is a complete nightmare scenario,” he said, adding that “the whole supply chain and third-party risk element is quite difficult to be dealt with”. The disruption has rippled out to regulators too. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main US derivatives regulator, has been unable to publish its weekly Commitments of Traders report, which shows the contracts that customers have been buying and selling. While it expects to resume on Friday, the report will be three weeks in arrears. Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange has been unable to produce its weekly report on futures positions, as required by European rules. European exchange operator Euronext has resumed publishing its weekly commodity derivatives report, but it is also in arrears.","20.02.2023"
"Will a $3bn bailout be enough for Sri Lanka?","First Republic plunges on deposit flight and credit rating hit","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Will a $3bn bailout be enough for Sri Lanka?’ Marc FilippinoHey, guys. We’re gonna get to today’s briefing in just a second. But first, I wanna tell you about FT Edit.

Today is Tuesday, March 21st, and this is your FT News briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING]  The International Monetary Fund is handing Sri Lanka a major bailout. And while banking troubles are starting to cool down in the US, First Republic Bank is still feeling the heat. Plus, the FT’s Katie Martin tells us why the deal for UBS to buy Credit Suisse is leaving some bondholders high and dry.  Katie MartinThis has been a very big shock to people who really know their stuff.  Marc FilippinoI’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] The International Monetary Fund approved a $3bn bailout for Sri Lanka yesterday. The country had been dealing with a mismanaged government for years, and the war in Ukraine led to soaring inflation and shortages last year that threw the country into a crisis. So will the money from the IMF help?  Jonathan Wheatley$3bn itself won’t do very much at all.   Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s Jonathan Wheatley. While the dollar amount of the bailout won’t do much, Jonathan says it will get the ball to recovery rolling.  Jonathan WheatleyIt gets them on the road we hope, to resolving, you know, 90 or $95bn worth of debt. Sri Lanka just isn’t generating enough revenue in the economy to pay off public debt. That’s why the IMF comes in. So you need an IMF program which does two things. It reduces the amount of debt, but it does that in order to make those debts sustainable and put the country back on a path to growth. Because Sri Lanka can’t just default and go away, they need to go on borrowing. Not only do they need to go on borrowing to do the stuff that they’ve been really struggling to do, like paying for health and education and basic public services. Sri Lanka and a whole host of other low-income, middle-income countries, all countries around the world have huge challenges to face. So these countries need to get their debts in order so that they’re sustainable. They can go back to markets. They need affordable borrowing and they need to be able to do it sooner rather than later.  Marc FilippinoJonathan Wheatley is the FT’s emerging markets correspondent. [MUSIC PLAYING] The dust from the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse is still settling, and it turns out that the deal left holders of Credit Suisse’s relatively risky debt out in the cold. $17bn worth of so-called AT1 bonds was wiped out, even though equity holders retained some value. As you can imagine, this did not go over well with a lot of people. Here to explain what exactly happened is our markets editor, Katie Martin. Hi, Katie.  Katie MartinHey, Marc.   Marc FilippinoSo these are AT1 bonds. A as in apple, t as in tiger, one. Can you tell us a little bit about the history of AT1 bonds?  Katie MartinAdditional tier 1 debt is a special type of debt the banks issue. It’s one of the really big innovations that came out of the financial crisis in 2008. Regulators got together and said, OK, let’s absolutely buster got to avoid a situation in which depositors in banks are left on the hook if a bank fails. And so what they did is came up with this kind of a little bit like debt, it’s a little bit like equity. And it’s this kind of squidgy layer that sits in between the two of them, the banks issue that provides a cushion. The whole point of it is that it absorbs some of the shock in the event that banks get into trouble and the holders can lose money on it. The thing is, buyers of additional tier 1 debt hardly ever lose money on it. So what happened when Credit Suisse and UBS went through this shotgun wedding, equity holders, OK, they’ve lost a lot of money, but they haven’t lost everything. Whereas the additional tier 1 bond holders have been wiped. Let me tell you something. This has not gone down well.  Marc FilippinoYeah. What has been some of the blowback to this?  Katie MartinSo there’s been lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth. There have been lots of people saying, wait a minute, you can’t just change the rules on this because of the way through the process and decide that we don’t get anything. This is a reasonable pushback. The problem is that if you look at the small print of the prospectus under which this AT1 debt has been issued by Credit Suisse, I’m not a lawyer, but it looks like they can do this if they want to. So this means that investors henceforth are going to take quite a different view around the safety of additional tier 1 paper. This has been a very big shock to people who really know their stuff.  Marc FilippinoSo, Katie, the whole point of this UBS-Credit Suisse deal was to make sure that the banking crisis didn’t have a contagion effect. Could the issue with AT1 bonds actually do the opposite and keep the crisis going?  Katie MartinI mean, I don’t wanna, you know, unfurl my mission accomplished banner too early, but it feels like this is contained. It feels like the casualties here are holders of AT1. And that feels like a reasonable kind of bit of collateral damage to the rest of the market. The rest of the market seems to be saying, well, it is in the small print, so I guess, you know, them’s the breaks, but I think there will be legal challenges. I think, you know, what we’re seeing already is regulators elsewhere in the eurozone, in the UK are saying, listen, we have AT1 there for a reason. And generally speaking, it won’t get wiped out unless the equity holders also get wiped out. So that’s kind of their reassurance to the market to say, listen, this debt still performs a function. This is still what it does.  Marc FilippinoKatie Martin is the FT’s markets editor. Thanks so much, Katie.  Katie MartinNo problem.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc FilippinoFirst Republic Bank is still in bad shape. That’s the regional bank caught up in the fallout from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. First Republic got a $30bn deposit from major US banks last week. The deposit was supposed to inspire confidence in the bank, but investors are still worried. Yesterday, the San Francisco based lender saw its stock plunge 47 per cent. The FT’s Brooke Masters explains why the big deposit didn’t stabilise the bank.  Brooke MastersIn a weird way, it scared people because why did they need to do that? Why did they need 30bn of extra deposit money if the bank is really stable? The thing to remember about First Republic is it had fears some, but certainly not all of the same characteristics as Silicon Valley Bank, which was the bank that started all this mess when it went down March 10th. Like Silicon Valley, First Republic has a lot of very large depositors who would not be covered by ordinary deposit insurance. So that means they’re worried about what happens to them if the world falls apart. And the other thing that’s wrong with First Republic, if you are an investor and scared, is that it has an enormous, long-dated mortgage book. This is different than SVB, but it has the same problem in that it is these mortgages, if held to maturity like all the way for 30 years, they’re fine, but on paper they are worth less right now because the Fed has raised interest rates. So if First Republic has to sell them to meet depositor withdrawals, they’re going to take big losses. So those two things are what freaked people out.  Marc FilippinoAre there other rescue plans in the works?  Brooke MastersThere’s definitely a lot of chatter. Ideally, from First Republic’s point of view, you would want somebody to put in what’s called an equity injection, ie buy more shares, because that gives them more resiliency in case they have future losses and it might reassure the market. However, if you are a fund manager or a bank putting in equity in something that might get taken over by the FDIC and therefore wipe out all of the shareholders is irresponsible. And so I think people are quite reluctant to put more equity in right now.  Marc FilippinoBut could the bank get sold to prevent a collapse, kind of like what we just saw with Credit Suisse?  Brooke MastersIt absolutely is a possibility. It could get sold. It could get taken over by the FDIC and then sold. I think the question for anybody who wants to buy it is, is this problem of this mortgage book that takes losses because it is a bank. If you buy another bank, you then have to take mark to market on everything, all of its assets, ie the loans it’s made. So you would take those losses. So there’s a reluctance again to sort of get involved. I mean, First Republic is a lovely banking franchise. It’s the kind of place that if you were kind of upper level wealth but not super money, go to and get really good treatment. It’s got customers who love it. So it’s a funny thing. It’s a really good franchise. It’s just in a weird bind right now.  Marc FilippinoBrooke Masters is the FT’s US financial editor. [MUSIC PLAYING] You can read more on all of these stories at FT.com.

"Macquarie commodities head’s $39mn payout beats CEO’s after record group profit","Nick O’Kane’s pay exceeds that of Shemara Wikramanayake for second year on back of strong trading business","Macquarie’s strength in global commodities trading has led to the business unit’s head earning 75 per cent more than the Australian bank’s chief executive after the division helped the company to a record annual profit in its financial year to the end of March. A 54 per cent rise in net profit for the commodities business — which trades oil, gas and electricity, predominantly in North America — to A$6bn ($4bn) meant its boss Nick O’Kane saw his share of the profit soar to A$58mn from A$36mn a year earlier.  His pay exceeded that of chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake — who earned A$33mn — for a second consecutive year and outstripped even the chief executives of some of the biggest US banks.   Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan made $34.5mn in both of the past two years and Goldman Sach’s David Solomon was paid $25mn in 2022, 30 per cent less than the year before. Macquarie, whose business encompasses asset management, retail and investment banking and commodities, reported a 10 per cent rise in net income for the year to A$5.2bn as the performance in commodities offset a softer result at the core asset management business. The bank maintained a cautious outlook despite a second year of record profit. Glenn Stevens, chair of Macquarie, said the payment to O’Kane was due to the “time-honoured” profit-share model at the Australian business and reflected the executive’s work in establishing the commodities business over the past two decades. “This is an exceptional year, so it is not a surprise that it is an exceptional number,” he said. Macquarie, which drew 71 per cent of its profit from outside Australia during the period, derived 51 per cent of overall profit from commodities compared with 23 per cent for the better-known asset management operation, which specialises in infrastructure investment. Assets under management increased 10 per cent to A$871bn, but the division’s profit over the year dropped 23 per cent to A$2.3bn, with the unfavourable comparison due to deal activity in the year before.  John Storey, an analyst at UBS, said the commodities business was the “standout performer” with a “vivid” outlook for further growth. The key question, he said, was the sustainability of the performance. Macquarie raised its full-year dividend to A$7.50 from A$6.22 a share but lowered the ratio of profit it paid out during the year to 56 per cent from 60 per cent.  Wikramanayake said this was due to a more cautious outlook and the need to invest in its organic growth rather than building a war chest for deals. “It behoves us to hold the capital for defensive reasons,” she said of the decision to increase its surplus capital to A$12.6bn.

"Rate rises test Charles Schwab’s tactics in US brokerage price wars","Broker’s big bet on customers’ cash looked like a smart move until Fed began to tighten","Charles Schwab’s war on fees has come home to roost, as rising interest rates sour the largest US broker’s big bet on customer cash.  Under pressure from low-cost start-ups such as Robinhood, Schwab shook its industry in 2019 by eliminating trading fees, then one of its big revenue streams. The move seemed decisive in a long industry-wide price war, letting it outflank low-cost competitors such as ETrade and TD Ameritrade and become the largest retail brokerage in the US with $7.4tn in client assets.  The bet that Schwab could win customers with low fees and profit by investing the cash that they kept on its platform initially proved to be an extremely lucrative one. But interest rates have risen at speeds not seen for decades and Schwab’s cash play has unravelled, sending its shares down almost 40 per cent this year.   The broker’s earnings, which it reports on Monday, will face scrutiny by investors concerned about its similarities to Silicon Valley Bank, which failed last month, sparking a sell-off of regional bank shares. Schwab’s stock has not recovered, and one of its largest investors, GQG, disclosed this week that it had sold its entire $1.4bn stake at the height of concerns over paper losses in Schwab bank’s bond portfolios.  In a statement, Schwab emphasised that it was different from the banks caught in March’s sell-off, saying that its share price did “not reflect the strength of our business”.  Schwab has a banking licence and analysts say that it began acting more like a lender than a broker in recent years. As customers deposited their savings and Covid-19 stimulus cheques on to the platform and markets climbed, Schwab automatically “swept” the money into bank accounts.  That made it one of the 15 largest banks in the US by deposits, earning $10.7bn in net interest in 2022 from customer cash on its platform, up by a third from 2021. While most banks use client deposits for lending, Schwab invested them into secure, long-dated bonds and mortgage-backed securities. But as with SVB, many of those investments lost value as rates rose. At the same time, Schwab’s clients have been moving cash into higher-yielding investments at speeds that caught it off guard.  Schwab was forced to take out expensive loans in the fourth quarter of 2022 as more than $43bn moved out of its cash accounts — though that money may remain in its brokerage, Piper Sandler noted, as clients chase higher rates in a process known as “cash sorting”.   Critics and analysts say the problems with Schwab’s cash play worsened this year. “They never expected the bond losses to get so big,” said Porter Collins, a short seller and co-founder of Seawolf Capital, who is known for his former firm’s short position during the 2008 housing market crash.  Seawolf has taken out short positions on Schwab in the past year, expecting that the money it was making on cash would tumble. Because US authorities do not consider Schwab to be systemically important, “no one was paying attention to the capital ratios on [its] balance sheet,” Collins said.  Analysts and investors have long been concerned about how Schwab’s strategy would be affected once interest rates began to rise. Customers who were once content to leave money in bank accounts that paid very little interest are now moving record sums to more lucrative alternatives.  “The brand is fine; the way they make money is not,” said Christian Bolu, an analyst at Autonomous Research. “The assumption is that a certain level of cash would always be in an account. But that assumption has been put to the test.”  Thomas Peterffy, billionaire founder of Interactive Brokers, a Schwab rival, said rising interest rates were changing how brokers made money.   “For a while, they were making a lot of money, and we were making very little money,” Peterffy said of Schwab. His firm has traditionally paid interest rates closer to the US Federal Reserve’s headline rate because its more sophisticated customers demanded it. “We didn’t really have a choice. And now we are making a lot of money, and they are not.” “Schwab’s target is the mom and pop investor,” he observed. Now, federal interest rates are too high for those traditionally reliable customers to ignore by parking cash in low-yielding accounts.  Analysts have lowered earnings forecasts for Schwab in light of recent outflows, estimating that its customers may have moved as much as $55bn out of its bank in the first quarter, as the assets into which it had invested their deposits lost value.  “They can’t sell the assets because they’re under water, and since they can’t sell [them] they’re replacing [them] with borrowing,” said Brennan Hawken, a UBS analyst. Schwab’s underwater assets are expected to yield about 2 per cent when they mature, but the cash it borrowed to avoid taking losses will cost it closer to 5 per cent, UBS estimates.  Schwab has expressed confidence in its business, with its typically media-shy chief executive Walt Bettinger telling CNBC that he had recently purchased 50,000 shares.* The broker announced more than $53bn in net core inflows in March, up from $42bn the previous month, though analysts note it is not yet clear whether those funds went into cash or to Schwab’s brokerage and money market funds.  Analysts said that while they expected Schwab’s net revenue to fall almost 32 per cent from the fourth quarter to $5.1bn, this would still be up 11 per cent from the first quarter of 2021.  “Fears they’re going to lose money are not even in the ballpark,” said Rich Repetto, an analyst at Piper Sandler.  If rates soften, rising yields will boost the value of some of Schwab’s investments. But, Hawken said, the brand still faces headwinds. “The earnings engine isn’t as strong as they thought it was. They built the engine around cash, and [cash] sorting is a flaw in that engine.” *This story has been amended to correct the number of shares bought by Walt Bettinger","16.04.2023"
"UK extends timeline on plan to reduce public stake in NatWest","Announcement comes after bank stocks were hit by collapse of SVB and rescue of Credit Suisse","The UK government has extended a deadline for reducing its stake in NatWest by two years, after bank stocks worldwide were hit by the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and a $3.25bn rescue deal for Credit Suisse. UK Government Investments, which oversees the Treasury’s stake in the bank, said on Monday that the deadline for its “trading plan”, which allows the government to sell its stake gradually over time at market prices, had been pushed back to August 11 2025. The bank was known as Royal Bank of Scotland when it was rescued in a £46bn bailout in 2008.   UKGI said that share sales under the trading plan had generated approximately £3.7bn over the past two years. NatWest was majority owned by the government until last March, with its stake currently at 41.5 per cent.  It is the second time the trading plan, originally announced as a one-year scheme in July 2021, has been extended. In June 2022, UKGI announced a 12-month extension.  UKGI said that no more than 15 per cent of total trading volume would be sold during the latest extended period. The treasury said it still intends to exit its shareholding by 2025-26. “We are determined to return NatWest to full private ownership,” said City minister Andrew Griffith. Bank shares have fallen sharply since March because of the collapse of California-based SVB, followed by the UBS rescue of Credit Suisse. Analysts have emphasised that reforms since the financial crisis have put the UK’s largest lenders in a strong position.  “No bank is bulletproof, but the UK incumbents look well positioned to weather the storm,” Jonathan Pierce at Numis wrote in a report last week, pointing to factors including high holdings of liquid assets. Nevertheless, fears over possible contagion have contributed to a more than 9 per cent fall in NatWest shares over the past month.  Shares were at 266.7p on Monday afternoon. The government paid 502p a share to bail out RBS in 2008. UKGI said that alternative methods of reducing ownership such as large bookbuilds that tend to be completed at a discount would be carried out only if they “achieve value for money for taxpayers”.

"Raine bags $65mn fee advising WWE on Endeavor takeover","US investment bank, which is leading sale of Manchester United, is set for one of its biggest ever paydays","Raine Group, the US merchant bank leading a sale of Manchester United football club, will rake in one of its biggest paydays if World Wrestling Entertainment’s merger with Ultimate Fighting Championship closes successfully. The group, launched in 2009 by former Goldman Sachs banker Joe Ravitch and Morgan Stanley and former UBS banker Jeff Sine, is set to make $65.5mn from the deal, with the vast majority of the fees due once it is complete. Raine has built its reputation advising on some of the biggest sports and entertainment transactions. Last year it helped Roman Abramovich sell Chelsea Football Club for £2.5bn and more recently landed a coveted role working on a potential sale of Manchester United for the billionaire Glazer family.   The details of Raine’s fee were recently disclosed in US securities filings as Vince McMahon’s WWE looks to complete an all-stock $21bn merger with Endeavor Group-owned UFC to create a wrestling and mixed martial arts entertainment powerhouse.  The filings last Friday show that JPMorgan and Moelis are set to earn about $25mn each for advising WWE alongside Raine. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.  The total aggregate fees of about 1 per cent of the transaction value to be paid to Raine, JPMorgan and Moelis, is at the high end of the historical range, according to a previous Financial Times analysis.  Raine’s Sine has worked with the McMahon family over a 20-year period, including Vince’s wife, Linda, who has also served as chief executive of WWE. The bank advised Vince McMahon on the revival of the XFL, a professional American football league, in 2020.  Endeavor faced competition from two other bidders but McMahon and Endeavor’s chief executive, Ari Emanuel, raced to complete the tie-up over WWE’s annual WrestleMania weekend extravaganza in early April.  Despite working with McMahon on the UFC merger, Raine has close ties with Emanuel, who was an initial backer of Raine. Raine has worked on several transactions involving Endeavor, including the $1.3bn sale of sports training business IMG Academy just weeks after the WWE deal was announced.  Raine — which has about 25 partners and managing directors, with total staff of about 175 — also played its part in a series of deals that formed Endeavor. It also has an investing arm. It advised talent agency William Morris Endeavor on the sale of a minority stake to private equity group Silver Lake in 2012 and the group’s acquisition of sports agency IMG the following year. It then advised UFC on its sale to the WME IMG — the predecessor to Endeavor — in 2016.  The WWE-UFC merger is a boon to the advisers in an otherwise slowing market for corporate dealmaking as higher interest rates and economic uncertainty have hurt activity.  Raine is advising on the Manchester United process, which has entered its final stages and has become one of the most closely followed deals in sport this year.  The competition for United has come down to just two bidders — British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, seeking to buy at least a majority stake — and Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani.  That is in stark contrast to the battle to buy Chelsea last May. The club was eventually sold for a record price for an English Premier League team in a deal orchestrated by Ravitch and Raine partner Colin Neville, earning Raine in the region of $38mn, according to LSEG Deals Intelligence estimates.","17.05.2023"

This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  Hedge funds made more than $7bn in profits by betting against bank shares during the recent crisis that rocked the sector, their biggest such haul since the 2008 financial crisis. The bumper gains followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the emergency sale of Credit Suisse which affected the wider banking sector in Europe and the US. Short sellers — who borrow stock and sell it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price — made estimated total profits of around $1.3bn from short positions taken against SVB, according to data firm Ortex.  A further $848mn in gains came from bets against First Republic, whose shares fell 89 per cent in March, before it received an emergency capital injection from 11 of America’s largest banks.  Investors made $684mn from shorting Credit Suisse, as a crisis of confidence in the Swiss lender sent its shares tumbling 71 per cent, according to the data. Profits from short positions across the US and European banking sector as a whole totalled $7.2bn. The data comes as US regulators have appointed BlackRock’s advisory arm to help sell a $114bn portfolio of securities inherited from last month’s takeovers of SVB and Signature Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was left holding the assets of mortgage-backed securities, collateralised mortgage obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities following the interventions.

"US stocks make gains but debt ceiling remains in focus","Tech stocks outpace broader equities on Wall Street as fresh data point to cooling economy","US stocks were subdued on Monday as investors awaited news about debt ceiling negotiations and assessed fresh data pointing to a cooling economy. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.7 per cent, extending its gains from the previous week, while Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 added 0.3 per cent. The moves in US equities came as traders were looking ahead to a breakthrough between the White House and Republican lawmakers in talks to raise the federal borrowing limit and avoid a national default, ahead of President Joe Biden’s meeting with Congressional leaders on Tuesday.  The KBW regional banking index, which has been buffeted by the failures of three lenders since March, added 3 per cent. “The stock market is stuck until we reach a debt-ceiling resolution and until we see more clarity from the regional banking sector, which are the two factors weighing on stocks right now,” said Brad Bernstein, managing director at UBS Wealth Management in the US.  Fresh economic data on Monday added to signs that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rates policy has begun to take effect. The New York Fed said its index measuring manufacturing activity in the state plummeted from 10.8 to minus 31.8 in May, far below analysts’ forecasts of minus 3.8. However, economists urged caution in interpreting the data, saying it could have been influenced by seasonal factors. The moves in US equities continue a pattern of growth stocks outpacing value stocks since the start of the year, as the Nasdaq Composite has added 19 per cent, compared with an 8.1 per cent advance for the S&P 500. “Big established technology names didn’t disappoint during the earnings season, and for the most part, offered guidance that was reassuring, something financial markets needed to hear,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.  Traders also awaited Tuesday’s release of US retail sales data for April, which will offer a snapshot on the health of the American consumer amid cooling inflation and higher borrowing costs.  The dollar fell 0.3 per cent against a basket of six other currencies, despite data last week showing US consumer expectations for long-term inflation had reached a 12-year high. In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 rose 0.2 pre cent, while France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s Dax ended the day flat, having steadied after trading down during much of the session. Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, reported the eurozone’s industrial production fell by a larger than expected 1.4 per cent year on year in March, after rising 2 per cent the previous month, suggesting the European Central Bank’s tightening campaign was cooling the region’s economy faster than expected. “It’s still not enough for the ECB to be convinced that its job is done,” said Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies. “They still need to hike more to fight inflation, but the economic data indicates that they are not far from being done.” Meanwhile, Germany said its wholesale price index recorded its first year-on-year drop since December 2020.  Asian stocks rose, with China’s CSI 300 climbing 1.6 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index adding 1.8 per cent. China’s renminbi fell on Monday to its weakest level against the dollar in two months.","15.05.2023"
"Alpha males plus poor governance equals big pay deals","Recent events at UniCredit echo those at Barclays a decade ago","When the government announced Alison Carnwath’s damehood in the 2014 New Year honours list, it described the then Land Securities chair as a “role model for women in business”. So she was — the now 70-year-old financier was a rare female chair of a FTSE 100 company, and had blazed a trail as a woman in the City of London’s upper echelons over a career that has now spanned nearly 50 years. But the commendation also specifically highlighted the principled stand Carnwath had taken on bonuses and pay issues, both at Landsec and at Barclays where she was the non-executive chair of the bank’s remuneration committee. This would all have remained ancient history in my memory, had it not been for recent events at Italy’s UniCredit.  Last month, the (female) remco chair at UniCredit left the bank prematurely after skirmishes at board level and beyond over the pay of chief executive Andrea Orcel.  People familiar with the episode say that after the resignation of Jayne-Anne Gadhia — who had been the subject of unsubstantiated leak allegations by the bank —  a new pay deal for Orcel was promptly hiked. UniCredit revealed recently that the former investment banker could earn nearly €10mn this year if he exceeds certain performance targets, an increase of 30 per cent (though the bank says performance restrictions, including less cash and more stock, are tougher). The parallels between these cases are troubling and threefold. Back at Barclays in 2012, the chief executive was Bob Diamond, who like Orcel displayed an easy charm with a steely aggression not far beneath. Both men have taken exceptionally high rewards for their performance in big banking jobs — Diamond’s bonuses and other Barclays-related rewards around the time of the financial crisis led then business secretary Peter Mandelson to brand him the “unacceptable face of banking”. It was his 2011 pay package — worth more than £24mn, including prior-year deferrals — that seemed egregious to many, especially given the bank’s poor performance and involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal.  Alison Carnwath blazed a trail as a woman in the City of London’s upper echelons over a career that has now spanned nearly 50 years. © Rosie Hallam/FT Orcel has become similarly used to high pay after a long career in investment banking. At Merrill Lynch, where he spent two decades, his prodigious dealmaking secured him a spot among the bank’s top earners for many years. At UBS where he ran the investment bank, Orcel was another top earner and after his seven-year term he had accumulated more than $50mn in deferred stock. And then came the infamous row with Santander, the Spanish bank that wanted to hire him as CEO but then baulked at the cost of buying out that UBS stock: a lawsuit ensued, the latest ruling from which is that Santander must pay him compensation of €43.5mn Diamond and Orcel were both confronted with strong-minded women as remuneration committee chairs. At Barclays, Diamond’s inflated pay infuriated Carnwath, who had argued for a zero bonus. Her views became public after the bank — and Carnwath in particular — were pilloried by shareholders at the Barclays annual meeting in May 2012 and she resigned shortly afterwards. Gadhia and her remco are understood to have agreed on a pay rise for Orcel, though not the 30 per cent increase that it later became. One banker familiar with events said Gadhia had been “a potential roadblock”.  Another crucial similarity between the Barclays and UniCredit cases was the role played by the two chairmen. At Barclays, Marcus Agius, an old-school relationship banker who struggled to rein in the hard-charging Diamond, backed the CEO over his remco chief. At UniCredit, chair Pietro Carlo Padoan, a former academic and government minister, took a similar stance. He told the Financial Times that Orcel had never “made any request to the board or remuneration committee with regard to increasing his compensation”, despite others saying that allies of Orcel lobbied hard on his behalf. In Unicredit’s case the bottom line is that the bank is performing well under Orcel. The shares are up around 120 per cent since he was appointed nearly two years ago. And his strategic nous is widely acknowledged. But when governance standards appear to be under strain, things often end badly. It was only three months after the Barclays AGM showdown over Diamond’s pay — and in the wake of regulatory and political pressure over the Libor scandal — that he was forced to resign. patrick.jenkins@ft.com ​Letter in response to this column: UniCredit piece contained ‘several fundamental flaws’ / From Professor Pier Carlo Padoan, Chairman, UniCredit, Milan, Italy","13.03.2023"

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter Icahn says he made a mistake An early victory for AT1 bondholders Geely takes Aston Martin for a spin Inside Carl Icahn’s bad decade The age of cheap money was supposed to be a time of easy profits for investors, but for one of Wall Street’s titans it spurred an epic string of losses.   Carl Icahn, the billionaire known for his activist battles with corporate giants like Texaco, Dell and Apple, has lost money every year since 2014, mostly by building costly hedges against a fast-rising market to protect his investment empire from a 2008-like collapse. Since the beginning of 2017, Icahn has lost nearly $9bn due to large hedges he built as he grew increasingly sceptical of valuations and the health of the global economy, a decision Icahn told DD’s Antoine Gara and Ortenca Aliaj was a mistake.  Carl Icahn: ‘Maybe I made the mistake of not adhering to my own advice in recent years’  © Bloomberg “I’ve always told people there is nobody who can really pick the market on a short-term or an intermediate-term basis,” Icahn said in an interview to discuss the Financial Times’ analysis of his losses. “Maybe I made the mistake of not adhering to my own advice in recent years.” According to an FT analysis, the prominent activist investor lost about $1.8bn in 2017 on hedging positions that would’ve paid out if asset prices had tumbled before losing a further $7bn between 2018 and the first quarter of this year. Icahn started aggressively betting on a market collapse in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and became increasingly bolder in subsequent years, deploying a complex strategy that involved shorting broad market indices, individual companies, commercial mortgages and debt securities. At times, Icahn’s notional exposure, the underlying value of the securities he was betting against, exceeded $15bn, regulatory filings show. “You never get the perfect hedge, but if I kept the parameters I always believed in . . . I would have been fine,” he said. “But I didn’t.”  The bearish trades neutralised about $6bn in gains from his activist wagers, leaving him with an overall investment loss of nearly $3bn since 2017 and the publicly listed vehicle he controls, Icahn Enterprises, in a vulnerable position. Earlier this month, short seller Hindenburg Research released a report criticising the finances of the vehicle, which is owned mostly by Icahn. It drew attention to large-margin loans Icahn had taken against his shares. Icahn told the FT that he had used the loans to make additional investments and had billions of dollars of cash outside of his public vehicle.  “Over the years I have made a great deal of money with money. I like to have a war chest and doing that gave me more of a war chest,” he added, referring to the margin loan. As pressure on his firm mounts, Icahn has been forced to rein in his short bets just as some investors fear that a regional banking crisis and the debt ceiling stand-off could result in a sharp market sell-off. Finally a win for Credit Suisse bondholders It is bad enough discovering that the regulator has entirely wiped out your investment. But it is truly awful when it then tries to keep its rationale for doing so a secret.  This was the situation facing Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 bondholders, who lost $17bn when Swiss financial regulator Finma ordered the bank to write down the bonds as a condition of its shotgun wedding to UBS. While Finma initially refused to disclose its decree ordering the writedown to AT1 investors (we guess bank secrecy is still a bit of a thing in Switzerland), a group that is suing the regulator has now managed to force it to hand over the document.  Inside are both highly technical (but important) justifications for the writedown alongside juicy details relating to the dire shape Credit Suisse found itself in the days before the UBS merger. Obtaining the document presents an early victory for the holders of at least $4.5bn of wiped-out Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bonds who are suing Finma. But the wider legal battle is still expected to be protracted and final victory is very much not assured. Still, when you’re fighting to overturn a decree, it helps to know what it actually says. No one likes battling in the dark.  Geely settles into its Aston Martin After years of pursuit, Geely has finally caught Aston Martin. Over years of patient stakebuilding, the Chinese car group has built a sprawling empire that covers investments in Mercedes-Benz, Lotus and Polestar. But the greatest prize has always been the British luxury brand. During an appearance at the FT’s Future of the Car summit last week, Geely’s chief executive Daniel Li said he “loved” the Aston Martin brand. When asked if it would raise its stake, he coyly replied: “We don’t have anything ready for an announcement.” Seven days later, the announcement was ready. Thursday’s deal sees it more-than double its stake to 17 per cent through new shares and some of chair Lawrence Stroll’s holding, with an agreement not to go above 22 per cent before August 2024. Geely isn’t in control, yet. It is still in third place in the investor deck to Stroll’s private band of investors, and to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is itself an investor in McLaren and electric vehicle start-up Lucid. But the company has a board seat and a “long-term partnership” to explore selling Aston Martin technologies and components from across its group. Geely bid for the company several times, most notably in late 2019, when the group presented a rival offer to Stroll’s. The big question for Aston Martin is whether Geely’s larger presence presents a future off-ramp for Stroll, whose investments have cratered as he tries to repair the brand’s “ultra-luxury” credentials. Stroll has consistently said he’ll stay invested in Aston Martin for the long run. But, as long as he can keep his son Lance racing in Formula 1 with Aston Martin as part of an agreement to sell the company, speculation will mount that he wouldn’t refuse a dignified transition. The Chinese group’s long-term plans shouldn’t be underestimated. The best way to understand Geely is through the words of former Volvo Cars boss Hakan Samuelsson, who was asked whether the company wanted to become China’s answer to Volkswagen. “Oh no,” he replied. “They’re far more ambitious than that.” Job moves Mediobanca has acquired Arma Partners with Paul-Noël Guély continuing to lead the London-based advisory firm’s team of 100 bankers.

"ByteDance and CNPC take over Hong Kong offices vacated by foreign companies","Mainland Chinese businesses are among those securing prime locations in Central district","Mainland Chinese companies have been moving into premium office areas in Hong Kong’s Central business district, taking over the prime locations left vacant by foreign groups in the wake of the pandemic.  ByteDance, the Chinese owner of social media platform TikTok and one of the country’s most valuable tech start-ups, is taking over about 16,000 sq ft of office space at One International Finance Centre this year from Switzerland-based bank Julius Baer, which is moving to a less central location, according to three people with knowledge of the deal. An affiliate of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation is set to move into a nearly 14,000 sq ft office in the Central business district, two sources said, after its previous tenant, flexible workspace provider Regus, owned by Switzerland-based IWG, closed its centre there.  Hong Kong experienced an exodus of foreign companies because of its zero-Covid pandemic control measures, with many moving people to rival Singapore. Prime office rents in Singapore rose nearly 6 per cent last year while Hong Kong’s dropped more than 6 per cent, data from real estate company Knight Frank showed. Hong Kong’s office market is reporting record high vacancy rates of about 17 per cent, according to property agency Cushman & Wakefield, with average rental prices at prime central offices dipping from HK$165 ($21) per sq ft in April 2019 to about HK$105 by March 2023. Mainland Chinese companies took up roughly 29 per cent of new lettings in the Central district in the first quarter of this year, data from commercial real estate agency Colliers showed, compared with 21 and 23 per cent in the whole of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Mainland companies find Hong Kong attractive as it is “still a global financial centre”, said Rosanna Tang, executive director and head of research in Hong Kong at Cushman & Wakefield. Banking, insurance and finance firms are among those from the mainland interested in new offices in the city, she added.  Many foreign companies have also been downsizing and moving staff away from the central business area to other areas as they cut costs and consolidate their offices, according to property agents.  Japanese bank MUFG and French lender BNP Paribas are among foreign companies planning to move staff away from the Central district to other areas in Hong Kong. FedEx, the US transport and delivery company, is moving staff and its Asia-Pacific headquarter functions to Singapore from Hong Kong. It will retain a Hong Kong office. Multinational groups will probably continue to move out of the Central district to save costs, according to Ada Fung, CBRE Hong Kong’s head of office services, advisory and transaction. UBS is set to move its staff from Central to West Kowloon from 2026.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of China’s biggest banks, is looking for a new office in Hong Kong for rental or purchase and has recently inspected two new flagship office buildings — Li Ka-shing’s Cheung Kong Centre II and Lee Shau-kee’s The Henderson — according to three people familiar with the matter.  United Energy, an oil and gas company controlled by Chinese tycoon Zhang Hongwei, is set to be the first tenant of Cheung Kong Centre II, said a source briefed on the matter. ByteDance confirmed the move. Julius Baer, MUFG and BNP Paribas did not offer further comment on their moves. IWG, CNPC, ICBC and United Energy have no response. This story has been amended to clarify that ByteDance is moving into One International Finance Centre (IFC). An earlier version implied it was moving into Two IFC, which is taller.","29.05.2023"
"Why did BlackRock explore a Credit Suisse offer?","Plus, Credit Suisse bankers grapple with reality and Wirecard’s former boss brings start-up lingo to the courtroom","One scoop start: UBS is set to enter talks with Michael Klein to unwind a deal that would have seen the Wall Street dealmaker take control of much of Credit Suisse’s investment bank, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Michael Klein has been deeply involved in the restructuring of Credit Suisse and has been a member of its board since 2018 © Bloomberg Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter Fink hunts for dealsCredit Suisse faces realityWirecard’s ex-boss takes the stand BlackRock’s eight-trillion-dollar-man goes fishing Larry Fink loves fly-fishing, music and big, transformational opportunistic mergers and acquisitions.  So DD wasn’t too surprised that the BlackRock founder’s ears perked up when Credit Suisse, the fallen banking giant where he started his Wall Street career, fell on the market for a song. As the FT reported over a hectic weekend, BlackRock was pretty much the only alternative to a takeover by UBS (outside of liquidation). In a sign of serious intent, Fink sent his main lieutenant Rob Kapito — another Credit Suisse First Boston veteran — to see if there was a deal to be done. “To be in the game you’ve got to play it,” Fink reportedly told his inner circle. But after indicating it did not want to buy the whole bank, BlackRock ultimately decided to halt its work on a bid. As Alphaville’s Robin Wigglesworth writes, the fact that BlackRock got involved in the CS situation shows that Fink still has another blockbuster deal up his sleeve, potentially a major play in wealth management. BlackRock chief Larry Fink used to work at First Boston, Credit Suisse’s investment banking business © Bloomberg The history of asset management industry consolidation has more slow-motion car crashes than the Fast & Furious movie franchise, but BlackRock has long proven itself in picking the right target at the right time.  The expectation has long been that Fink’s next big gambit will be an acquisition in the private capital industry ­­— an area where BlackRock is relatively underpowered. The mega-money manager began sniffing around Carlyle last year, the FT reported, when the private equity group was engulfed by chaos by the sudden departure of chief executive Kewsong Lee. “They [BlackRock] want to buy an alternative manager, but I don’t think they are going to do anything sometime soon,” a person with knowledge of the discussions said in December. Private capital is still the most likely acquisition target for BlackRock, with few opportunities even remotely similar to Credit Suisse likely to hit the market. A major expansion into wealth management makes sense for BlackRock. The firm is the world’s biggest manufacturer of investment products, which are primarily distributed to institutional investors. But it lacks the wealth management side of rivals such as Fidelity (whose pre-tax profits were almost a quarter higher than BlackRock’s in 2022, at $8bn).  Buying Credit Suisse would have given it a way to target the world’s upper class. The question, of course, is whether Fink’s interest was purely driven by a good bargain, or a sign of a new strategy. Man vs. Wild: banking edition When a group of Credit Suisse bankers gathered for a camping retreat with Bear Grylls in Sai Kung, Hong Kong, they were ostensibly there to glean wisdom from the celebrity survivalist that could be applied to a corporate setting. Footage from the outdoor adventure trip was meant to be aired at the Swiss bank’s flagship investor conference this week in a presentation by Grylls titled “lessons learned from navigating some of the harshest environments”. The general feeling at the conference, though, was that not even a crash course from the Man vs. Wild star could prepare them for the challenge ahead, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Cheng Leng report. Despite UBS’s forced takeover of the Swiss lender, CS chief Ulrich Körner and chair Axel Lehmann have urged bankers to “continue to work as normal”. Part of that included carrying on with the conference at Hong Kong’s five-star Conrad hotel, fittingly themed “Embracing Reality”. On the surface, things seemed like business as usual. “If you didn’t read the news, you wouldn’t have thought anything had happened,” said Mark Kwan, an executive director of Singapore’s Straits Asset Management. But some panels, such as “Where has all the risk gone?”, felt out of place. And dry humour frequented private conversations, joking about whether attendees needed to pay for their own breakfast or whether the Swiss National Bank would pay, and whether bankers’ corporate cards were still working, said one attendee. Later on Tuesday, however, the laughs were stifled: Switzerland’s finance ministry banned CS from paying deferred bonuses awarded before 2022.  Though the details are still surfacing, the bank had promised earlier this week that it will continue to hand out bonuses and pay rises as planned. As one CS banker put it: “we are not entirely clear what will happen next but morale is so down it’s hard to even describe”. Further damping the mood is the expectation of tens of thousands of job cuts. Those worrying about missing out on future compensation could take notes from their colleagues at the investor conference.  Two people told the FT, partly in jest, that they were hoping to pick up merchandise that would mark the end of an era. Lehman Brothers-branded baseball caps fetch hundreds of dollars on eBay, after all. Markus Braun turns the court into a boardroom In the conference rooms of ambitious start-ups and corporate disrupters, hype and hubris have been known to mix freely with the facts. But Markus Braun seems to have forgotten that he’s no longer in the boardroom while on trial in Munich for one of Europe’s biggest accounting frauds. Clad in his signature black turtlenecks, the former Wirecard boss came armed with PowerPoint presentations and industry jargon, which have often sounded more like investor briefings than statements in a criminal case, the FT’s Olaf Storbeck reports. The crux of his testimony, he has adamantly maintained hour after hour in court, is that the fraud was orchestrated entirely without his knowledge and involvement. Instead, he has blamed the fallen payments group’s fugitive second-in-command Jan Marsalek and former Dubai-based manager Oliver Bellenhaus for creating a “shadow structure”, hijacking payments processing by Wirecard and embezzling its returns. Presiding judge Markus Födisch hasn’t hid his frustration with this strategy. “You have just said with very many words the same as before: nothing,” he said on one occasion. German spies suspect Marsalek is in Russia, but he remains on the run. But one interesting revelation has surfaced in Austria regarding the former Wirecard operating chief. Marsalek, who was revealed by the FT in 2021 to be under suspicion by western intelligence agencies of being a spy for the Kremlin, has a grandfather who was also suspected of being a Russian operative, the FT’s Sam Jones reports.

"Policymakers are bungling their response to failing banks","You are doomed to repeat the errors of the last crisis if you don’t use the tools put in place since then","This article is an on-site version of Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Thursday Have we then learnt nothing? From the way regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have handled bank failures over the past week, it feels to me like the answer is “no”. What is most striking is that the systems put in place after the last financial crisis were not used as intended — instead policymakers in the US and Switzerland hurried to come up with ad hoc solutions for Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse. They may have thought that this was best to stem panic and safeguard financial stability. Many seem to agree that it is too idealistic to follow plans made for these crises in quieter times, and that “pragmatism” must rule. After all, no battle plan survives the first contact with the enemy. But that thought, I fear, is precisely the problem.  To see why, think about financial crises in the deepest sense.  Financial crises happen when the value of assets people think the financial system holds does not add up to the sum of all the claims they think they have on it, meaning that not all those claims will be honoured in full. It does not matter that what people expected to get may never have been realistic or rational. It does not even matter — at least in the first instance — whether their beliefs about the value of the assets in the system are overly pessimistic. What matters is that expectations are adjusted — and in that process a lot of damage can be done.  When suspicion sets in that there is not enough value to go around, people rush in a devil-take-the-hindmost kind of way to get their money out of danger, leaving others more exposed to the assets that are no longer trusted to be what they were thought to be. Because policy decisions will determine who finally bears any losses, an almightily political battle breaks out over how to allocate them. And while all this goes on, financial institutions will find it too risky to extend or make new loans and investments and investors will find it too risky to recapitalise banks and other entities. All these processes — the first rapidly, the others grindingly — put a brake on economic activity, because of the uncertainty that poisons any choice to place new capital to work. That makes the losses even worse and gives another spin to the downward spiral. For that reason, you minimise the fallout by getting expectations realigned as fast as possible so that everyone can move on. If we understand this basic anatomy of financial crises, some policy lessons are evident. The first is that you need to allocate the losses. That is to say, regulatory and legal mechanisms must crystallise losses and define where the writedowns must take place. The second is that you must do so as quickly as possible. The third is that you must do so in ways that create a sufficiently capitalised banking system after all losses are written down. The fourth has to do with politics: you must muster political backing for the inevitable redistributive effects, compensate those who legitimately need to be compensated, and tell those who don’t (and those who shoulder compensation costs) that this is the name of the game.  None of this is easy or pleasant. All of it is easier to do if you agree it in advance. That is why governments put in place laws and methodologies that would allow them to quickly restructure the balance sheets of banks in trouble, which just means to crystallise their losses and reduce the claims people have on the banks. If this is done ambitiously enough, the (now more realistically valued) assets again exceed liabilities by a safe margin: the restructured bank is now unencumbered by past losses and ready to lend again. These bank resolution regimes are, on the whole, well-designed. But the two natural instincts to want to calm things down and to avoid imposing losses on anyone, even if the aim is to try to stop things from getting worse, militate against doing what needs to be done. My colleague Helen Thomas observes: “No matter how much work has been done on bank resolution, when push comes to shove regulators and politicians have balked at the prospect.”  With this in mind, go back over the past week’s bank rescue operations.  SVB was brought low because depositors got scared by how rising interest rates hurt the market value of the bank’s government-guaranteed assets. But rising interest rates have affected the assets of all US banks. By how much? Sebastian Mallaby and my colleague Martin Wolf cite research putting the market value losses to US banks’ total assets at $1.7tn to $2tn, almost as large as their aggregate equity cushion of $2.1tn. That is a bigger issue than the implosion of SVB and a few other midsize banks. But it’s not the issue US authorities have addressed. Their ad hoc decision to make whole the uninsured depositors of SVB was a decision to depart from the standard resolution procedure the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation applies to failing smaller banks. It smacks of an unwillingness to allocate losses — and that is a bad sign given the extent of unrealised losses in the banking system as a whole. It is, of course, not insurance but a bailout after the fact, which somebody has to pay for since the uninsured depositors will not. To say no taxpayer money was used is a ruse: higher FDIC fees are, for all practical purposes, a tax rise, because the banks that have to pay them have little choice but to accept. To be fair, at least the FDIC wrote down all shareholder and unsecured bondholder claims to zero, which is better than what Switzerland did, on which more below. So US authorities are trying to gin up confidence in the US banking system rather than solve the problems that have caused the current bout of pessimism. Unless they are very lucky, that approach is unsustainable, and is already making matters worse. Everyone is now asking whether their deposits would be safe if their bank gets into trouble. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has not given a reassuring answer: the policy seems to be that if you have a deposit above the $250,000 insurance limit, you will be bailed out if a run on your bank is likely to trigger contagion to the wider banking system — but not otherwise and not until then.  That is an invitation to large depositors in smaller banks to move their money out — either to the big ones, which will always be deemed systemically important, or to money market funds — as is already happening. Yellen’s exchange with Senator James Lankford last week (hat tip: Claudia Sahm) makes clear that the government has no answer to this. The only possible answer would be to insure all depositors, without limit, now — but as she told lawmakers yesterday, there was no immediate plan for this. And as I wrote last week, any case for guaranteeing all deposits is a case for government provision of deposits through a central bank digital currency.  The resulting negative spiral from banks to the economy is surely at work. Midsize and small US banks account for a large proportion of lending to the US economy — in particular, commercial real estate, but also mortgages and business lending. Not only will such newly risky banks become much more cautious about issuing new loans. If they also have to sell assets to cover deposit outflows, they will make one another’s solvency problems worse. Already there are deep fears in the market for mortgage-backed securities.  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here So what do I think US authorities could have done instead? In the specific case of SVB, they could have let the normal FDIC process run its course. In conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s new programme to lend against government securities at face value, depositor losses would have been minimal. Some have also argued the government could have invoked the special resolution powers in the Dodd-Frank rules called “orderly liquidation authority”, which would have covered SVB’s holding company and possibly “bailed in” (written down) claims on other parts of the group ahead of SVB’s uninsured depositors. Either move was available but required a greater political willingness to clarify who takes a loss.   What about the effect on other banks? As some have proposed, accounting rules could be made to immediately crystallise market value losses in the banking system, thus bringing accounting realities in line with expectations faster. That would lay bare the need for broader liquidity provision in case of bank runs and, more fundamentally, for recapitalisation. In other words, the mechanisms for writing down shareholders and bondholders put in place after the last crisis would have had to be taken out of the toolbox. It may still come to this. The authorities are clearly hoping they can calm markets down instead — the very definition of a confidence trick. But if it doesn’t work, the pain will be greater. Again, it’s short-sightedness passing for responsible pragmatism. Now consider Switzerland, for which the Financial Times’s tick-tock account of how the government made UBS take over the doomed Credit Suisse in a keep-it-in-the-national-family merger is indispensable. Here, too, the unwillingness to go ahead with long-laid plans for just such a situation is striking. My colleagues quote a UBS-related source as saying: “Resolution [a government-controlled wind-down] would have been a disaster for the financial system and introduced the threat of contagion around the world.” I have been amusing myself reading the website of Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, in particular the pages on resolution and recovery schemes. These, we are told, “addressed” the risk that a bank would be too big to fail and “force a de facto government bailout funded by the taxpayer”. How is that working out for you? We are entitled to ask after Switzerland offered loss guarantees in the billions and a SFr100bn ($109bn) liquidity line to make the shotgun marriage go through. And who benefits from these taxpayer subsidies? In complete violation of the liability “hierarchy”, where it is shareholders’ job to absorb losses first, the owners of Credit Suisse were paid $3.25bn in the UBS merger, even as some bondholders — the so-called additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds — were written down in full. We shouldn’t feel too sorry for those creditors, whose job it was to be written down when trouble hit. But being bailed in before shareholders lose everything was not the general understanding of how banks are meant to be recapitalised, even if the Swiss authorities may have the letter of the law (and of the bond contracts) on their side. That $3.25bn is money that could have stayed with taxpayers (if UBS hadn’t had to grant it to Credit Suisse shareholders, it could have been subsidised that much less). The impression is, again, that the losses of bank shareholders will be limited, at taxpayers’ expense. If UBS faces bigger losses than thought, that will not be pretty. And again, by not going by the plans laid in quieter times, policymakers have worsened fears elsewhere in the system. EU regulators have had to insist they would never do the same as Switzerland; even so, AT1-type bonds have fallen in value globally.  And I mean “plans” quite literally. Finma’s 2022 resolution report confidently tells us that Credit Suisse had produced its required “Swiss emergency plan” for how to keep its Swiss operations going in case it failed, which Finma viewed “as ready to implement”. Finma itself had a resolution plan for Credit Suisse as a whole but said full “resolvability” would not be ready until the end of 2022. I would quite like to know what these plans were, so I wrote to Finma and asked to see them. I have not received a reply. But I think it is a fair guess they did not prescribe what was actually decided last weekend.  On both sides of the Atlantic, then, the lesson has been that policymakers in a crisis have thrown out the plans and ignored the tools that were thoughtfully prepared precisely for these eventualities. Why? Wolf suggests in the column I linked to above that “the functions of the banks in providing money and credit are too vital to allow” writing down claims to their market value. I take that to imply that regulators are right to throw out all the resolution plans and “living wills” of banks, and we were all deluded in developing them in the first place. My view is the opposite — that swift resolution is the best way to safeguard the functions of banks, and that policymakers are therefore failing us badly by not making use of them.  If they don’t quickly change tack, we are facing another lost decade like the sluggish recovery of the 2010s. So far, our regulators are proving worse than the Bourbons*. They have learnt nothing, and forgotten everything. Other readables European industrialists keep pushing for the EU to “compete” with the US’s Inflation Reduction Act — in other words, to pay them more subsidies. But their lobbyists admit sotto voce that this may be more a “psychological game” in a shakedown of politicians than a real existential threat.Lucrezia Reichlin writes that the current crisis may lead us to adopt central bank digital currencies as a form of fully insured deposits, and Martin Wolf makes the same point in the column mentioned above. Depositors fleeing to the safety of central bank money is in fact already happening, The Economist reports, through money-market funds’ ballooning reverse repo transactions with the Federal Reserve.The IMF looks at the jump in digitisation caused by the pandemic: “We can see that it helped boost productivity, protect employment, and mitigate economic disruptions during the pandemic.” Numbers news My colleague Anastasia Stognei reports that Russian oil-exporting companies may be under-reporting the prices they sell at, which could circumvent the western-imposed price cap but also save them tax owed to the Russian government.

"A spending injection alone is not the cure for China’s ailing economic recovery","Since high debt and a weakening property market will limit any stimulus, structural measures are needed ","The writer is chief China economist and head of Asia economics at UBS Investment Research, and author of ‘Making Sense of China’s Economy’ After a promising start, China’s economic recovery has waned in the past two months. Investors have been disappointed by the lack of policy responses, with some questioning whether China’s government still cares about economic growth. In the past week or so, hope has grown for a major stimulus package. What should we expect? I believe the government does care about growth and will intervene to stabilise the economy and the property market when necessary. Given the recent sharp deterioration in economic momentum, the time is ripe for action.  However, policy support is likely to remain modest and could include easing property restrictions, a muted increase in infrastructure spending, funding support for property developers and local governments, and targeted consumption subsidies. Those expecting a large fiscal package similar to that of 2008 or even 2015, a wholesale bailout of local government debt, major monetary expansion or measures to reinflate the property market may be sorely disappointed. First, China has less fiscal room for manoeuvre. Total debt reached almost 300 per cent of gross domestic product in 2022, according to the Bank for International Settlements. We estimate government debt including that of local government platforms exceeds 90 per cent of GDP, with most of it at the local level where cash flow is usually insufficient to cover interest payments. China’s high domestic savings and state-owned banking system limit the risk of a liquidity-driven debt crisis, so in theory the central government could borrow more to fund a generous fiscal stimulus. However, the country faces huge fiscal challenges including rising pension and healthcare costs to support its rapidly ageing population. Second, while new property starts and sales have fallen excessively and need to be stabilised, shifts in supply and demand suggest a weaker housing market ahead. More than 127mn units of urban housing have been built since 2008. Most old city centres have been upgraded and shantytown dwellings replaced. Meanwhile, housing ownership reached 80 per cent in 2020. China’s population is declining, and most rural labour has already moved to work in cities. Household income growth has weakened too. Third, there is no guarantee that significant monetary expansion would work given the weak corporate and household confidence and high debt in both sectors. With low private sector credit demand, monetary expansion could end up simply supporting local government spending, perpetuating an unsustainable growth model. The Chinese government may also worry about the risk to financial stability and inflationary consequences. Most importantly, I think Beijing’s policymakers understand these economic woes are not just cyclical. Large stimuli cannot address deep-rooted structural issues. Willingly or not, China is transitioning away from growth led by property and local government, which is a painful process. Consumers lack confidence in future pension and healthcare coverage and continue to spend cautiously. Low investor confidence in the private sector is not just due to the weak economy but also the uneven playing field with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and concerns about tighter regulation.  To make matters worse, Chinese firms are battling reduced access to advanced technology and decoupling from the US and its allies. China’s exports and inbound foreign direct investment are also feeling the effects of global supply chain adjustments. Swift action is now needed to combat the sharp slowdown, especially in the battered property sector. But instead of sweeping spending, China should opt for a moderate stimulus package (1 to 2 per cent of GDP), accompanied by concrete structural policies. These could include reducing entry barriers and enhancing legal protection for the private sector; a well-publicised increase in healthcare and social protection spending; and deepening hukou (household registration) reforms to increase labour mobility and rural migrants’ spending power. While big SOE reforms are unlikely, measures could be taken to increase efficiency and curb their monopoly. While China may disappoint a market hoping for large fiscal stimulus, this need not harm its economy in the long run. A smaller role for the government in steering growth may lead to more pronounced economic cycles, but could also help clear inefficient market players, make more space for the private sector to develop, and boost resources for social spending. Such a realignment of the roles of the state and the market would be welcome.","21.06.2023"
"Hedge funds raise bets against US stocks as debt deadline nears","Shorts linked to S&P 500 hit 12-year high amid caution on valuations and earnings","Hedge funds and asset managers have raised their bets against the US stock market to their highest level since 2011, driven by fears about a possible US debt default and a recession. Net short positions — bets on price falls — held in derivative contracts linked to the S&P 500 have increased sharply in recent weeks, according to a Société Générale analysis of a combination of futures positions from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Investors have been racing to protect their portfolios as the US edges closer to a debt default, with president Joe Biden warning Republicans in Congress that a failure to reach a deal to raise the government’s $31.4tn borrowing limit would be a “catastrophe” for the economy.  Despite the debt concerns and the collapse of several US regional banks in the spring, the S&P has risen 8 per cent this year, hitting an eight-month high earlier this week and fuelling hopes that a new bull market has already begun on Wall Street. The market’s rise “seems misplaced given that investors were never pricing in a material risk of failure to raise the debt ceiling to begin with”, said Marko Kolanovic, a JPMorgan strategist. Société Générale described the high level of short positions as a warning signal that is “too strong to ignore”. US politicians are looking to finalise a deal on the debt ceiling in the coming days, ahead of June 1 when the US could run out of cash to pay all of its financial obligations. Many managers are also concerned about valuations on US equities and the possibility that the rapid rises in interest rates by the Federal Reserve over the past year to try to fight inflation could trigger a recession. The S&P 500 is currently trading on a price to forward earnings multiple of 18.7 times, towards the top of its historic valuation range.  “Equities seem somewhat expensive to us. Price [to] earnings ratios are close to historic highs,” said Kenneth Tropin, chair of Connecticut-based Graham Capital Management, which runs $17.7bn in assets. He said his firm’s traders had been running a small short position for much of this year, although these had been cut back because of the rally in stocks. “Given a rally driven by only a handful of names, relatively expensive valuations in technology companies and large-cap growth stocks, and the negative impact of credit tightening on company earnings, we expect higher volatility in the months ahead and see the S&P 500 at around 3,800 by December,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. On Friday the index was about 4,175. Many hedge funds have been buying individual stocks with strong cash flow, while also putting on short bets against the overall market, reflecting their caution, according to Mario Unali, a portfolio manager at investment firm Kairos. “Conviction in a broad-based risk rally remains muted due to the uncertain economic environment,” he added. Some in the market believe that problems in stock markets could start to be felt later in the year, particularly if interest rates stay higher than markets expect.  Michael Wilson, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said an earnings recession was approaching in the second half of this year as consumer spending was beginning to slow and the problems affecting regional banks would accelerate the tightening in the availability of credit for US businesses.  “The major [US equity] indices are priced for simultaneous good outcomes on multiple fronts whereas we think risks are elevated and even increasing in some instances,” said Wilson. “My best guess is something during the second half of the year we could see a good size correction in equities if the Fed disappoints those who believe they will be cutting rates three times before year end,” said Graham’s Tropin.","26.05.2023"
"GAM held takeover talks with Zürcher Kantonalbank ","Troubled asset manager under pressure to find a buyer after failing to recover from 2018 scandal","Switzerland’s Zürcher Kantonalbank has held takeover talks with GAM, the troubled asset manager that delayed its results as it races to find a buyer this month. ZKB, the largest of Switzerland’s state-owned cantonal banks, has had discussions with GAM in recent months about acquiring the business, according to people familiar with the situation.  GAM, which comprises an investment management arm and a fund services division, in February pushed back the release of its annual results to find extra time to secure a sale. The asset manager is due to release its results on Tuesday.   ZKB and Liontrust, a UK boutique fund manager, are among several potential suitors for GAM, which has endured a spectacular fall from grace since a scandal over its holdings of illiquid debt rocked the company in 2018. Its share price has plunged more than 95 per cent since the start of 2018, and last year the group hired UBS to help sell the business.  ZKB said that it “is constantly examining opportunities within its business development strategy” but declined to comment on “rumours”. London-listed Liontrust disclosed earlier this week that it was in talks with GAM but cautioned that it may not lead to a formal offer.  Another investment firm, New York-based Z Capital Group, has also shown interest in buying GAM, according to a person familiar with the matter, as it seeks to expand its asset management business. Z Capital Group declined to comment. GAM said earlier this month that the “board is working tirelessly on options to ensure that the firm is strategically positioned in the best interests of all stakeholders”. One banker said that GAM was “quite a complex business” made up of a fund administration division that services third parties as well as its own investment management arm. Once one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, GAM’s troubles began in July 2018 when it suspended former star fund manager Tim Haywood with little explanation, prompting investors in its Absolute Return Bond funds, which Haywood managed, to rush for the exit.   It later transpired that Haywood had bought bonds relating to Lex Greensill’s now collapsed supply chain finance business Greensill Capital, which counted former UK prime minister David Cameron as an adviser. Insiders at Zurich-based GAM had voiced concerns about Haywood’s relationship with Australian financier Greensill, which ultimately led to the liquidation of the funds.  Chief executive Alexander Friedman stepped down while Haywood was subsequently fired. In 2021 GAM was fined £9.1mn by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for conflicts of interest. While GAM has never recovered from the scandal, the company said its funds have performed well, pointing out in January that more than half of its largest products were ranked in the top decile over the past three years.","22.04.2023"
"How rising interest rates are exposing bank weaknesses","Recent collapses in US and Europe highlight new threats to lenders and upend conventional wisdom","The end of historically low interest rates was billed as good news for banks, which make more money as the difference widens between what they charge borrowers and what they pay for funding. But recent crises on both sides of the Atlantic show that the reality is more complex, upending the conventional wisdom.  Some banks, notably in Europe, are stuck with big loan books at interest rates fixed far below current levels. Others with a higher share of their book at variable rates can immediately charge more for outstanding loans but risk a wave of defaults from borrowers who can no longer afford to service their debt.  Then there is the issue of government bonds, where banks have been holding ever more of their liquidity after post-financial crisis regulations curbed their risk-taking. Bonds bought a year ago have fallen in value because they offer lower interest rates than those sold today, which is fine unless banks are forced to sell them to meet depositors’ demands.   Another concern is the unpredictable behaviour of depositors as they look for more lucrative places to park their cash, including money market funds and crypto, if banks are slow to raise rates for savings.  Below is a rundown of how all this and more is playing out in branches and trading rooms from London to New York. Losses on bond portfolios  Banks routinely buy very safe government debt as a way to meet regulatory requirements to hold a sufficient amount of high-quality liquid assets. Rising rates have sharply driven down the value of such bonds.  The US Federal Reserve said American banks had $620.4bn in unrealised losses on their securities portfolios at the end of 2022, including $340.9bn on bonds they did not plan to sell. Under US rules, lenders do not have to take into account mark-to-market losses in their earnings or capital ratios, so most have not hedged against that possibility.  When a bank finds itself short of cash to meet deposit outflows, as happened to Silicon Valley Bank, it may be forced to sell part of its “held to maturity” portfolio, crystallising losses and potentially spooking both investors and depositors. The rules are different for banks in Europe, where regulatory capital already reflects the effect of prevailing interest rates on most bonds. In the UK, Numis analyst Jonathan Pierce says the six big UK banks have £600bn of debt securities, of which two-thirds are already carried at fair value.   Writing down the rest of the portfolio to current market prices would hit the banks’ capital ratios by just 30 basis points, he said, a small amount in the context of their average 15 per cent capital ratios which were “more robust than in many banking geographies”.  Analysts say European banks also appear to have hedged much of the rate risk. That eliminates the problem of unrealised losses affecting a bank’s ability to lend, as hits on bond values happen in real time.  Fixed-rate loans Rising rates pose a dual challenge to the lending side of banks’ asset books.  Those able to pass on rate rises to customers via floating-rate loans enjoyed a surge in earnings in 2022. Fixed-rate loans have less chance of default but they are also a profitability drag for banks whose own funding costs will be increasing. Higher rates also lead to more defaults, although non-performing loans remain at low levels in the EU where only 1.5 per cent of mortgages were classed as bad loans in September, the latest available European Banking Authority data shows.  Variable-rate loans are becoming more popular in the eurozone but fixed mortgages still account for about three-quarters of the total, according to European Central Bank data. The proportion varies by country — an ECB study in 2019 found that fixed-rate products made up just 4.5 per cent of mortgages in Portugal but more than 80 per cent in France. In the UK, almost 85 per cent of all mortgage loans were at fixed rates at the end of last year but the percentage for new home loans was almost 95 per cent, data from the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority shows.   The picture is more complicated in the US, where adjustable-rate mortgages account for less than 10 per cent of total mortgages but 36 per cent of those held on bank balance sheets, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data.   Commercial real estate Commercial real estate loans are particularly in focus for banks. As well as surging interest rates, property investors are facing lower valuations because of pandemic-related changes to work and shopping patterns. Just over two-fifths of US CRE loans are held by banks, according to JPMorgan. Fed chair Jay Powell said last week that the central bank “was aware” of concentration in CRE lending but stressed that he did not think the issue was comparable to other strains on banks. European banks’ exposure to commercial real estate has been identified as a “key vulnerability” by the ECB. However, CRE makes up only about 6 per cent of European loan books, according to asset manager DWS.  Conservative loan-to-value ratios of 50 to 60 per cent in Europe also give banks a healthy cushion to absorb falling prices, according to a Bayes Business School study. Yet debt costs have doubled in a year and analysts expect turmoil in the banking sector to add to refinancing challenges. “Lending standards going forward will be tighter,” said Zachary Gauge, real estate analyst at UBS. “We haven’t seen an awful lot of forced sales coming through but there are assets that are in trouble.”  Private assets Another area in focus is banks’ exposure to the burgeoning world of private credit. High on regulators’ watch lists are leveraged loans, which private equity groups typically use to fund their acquisitions. Leveraged loans typically combine “high leverage, aggressive repayment assumptions, weak covenants, or terms that allow borrowers to increase debt, including draws on incremental facilities”, according to an annual review issued by US regulators last month. Because such loans attract interest at floating rates, their value does not mechanically fall as rates rise — but that may not help much if overleveraged companies struggle to meet the rising cost of servicing their debts. Credit to hedge funds that have made big bets on interest rates is another area that banks are carefully monitoring. The Financial Times reported last weekend that US regulators had flagged concerns over one fund, Rokos, which was forced to give extra collateral to banks after its rates bets backfired.  Deposit outflows When interest rates and inflation rise, savers expect their money to work harder. That does not always happen at banks, which can prompt customers to take their money elsewhere.  In the US, total bank deposits have fallen 3.3 per cent since the Fed began raising interest rates last year, as savers sought out higher-yielding alternatives to the 1 per cent interest many US banks offer, such as the 4 per cent they can get from money market funds.  The trend accelerated around the time SVB and Signature Bank failed. Deposits at US banks declined by the most in almost a year in the seven days to March 15.  Fed data shows that the deposit outflows — which overall amounted to $98.4bn or 0.6 per cent of the total — came from small banks, while there was an increase in deposits at larger rivals.  “We could see a sizeable credit crunch as banks will need to rein in lending due to large deposit flight,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.  In the eurozone, depositors have withdrawn €214bn over the past five months, or 1.5 per cent of total deposits, according to data published this week by the ECB. The decline accelerated in February, the latest month for which there is data, as depositors cut their holdings by €71.4bn, the biggest monthly fall since records began in 1997.  European banks have been able to replace some deposit funding by issuing covered bonds, which are secured against a pool of home loans, said Luca Bertalot, secretary-general of the European Mortgage Federation.  Funding cost increases While other funding sources are available, they become more expensive when rates rise as investors demand higher yields. The recent decision by Swiss regulator Finma to wipe out SFr16bn ($17bn) of additional tier 1 bonds as part of the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse will further increase European banks’ wholesale funding costs.   On average, European banks hold AT1 exposure equivalent to 2.2 per cent of their risk-weighted assets, although it is markedly higher at some lenders such as Julius Baer with 7.2 per cent, and Barclays at 3.9 per cent.  “For the second-tier Swiss banks — not UBS but the likes of Julius Baer or Vontobel — there is a fear over whether the market is going to be open for AT1s and, even if it is, at what price?” said an adviser to several banks.

"NatWest: UK still struggling to cheque out","Ministers will plough on, but they should have made a clean break with the bank years ago","Fresh banking turmoil has erupted in the US and continental Europe. Unfortunately, the UK government has still not finished clearing up after the last bout of mayhem. It still owns about 41.5 per cent of NatWest, as Royal Bank of Scotland is now known. The government has extended a deadline to drip feed shares into the market under a trading plan until August 2025. That would be less than three years short of the 20th anniversary of the £45.5bn bailout of the debt-laden lender in the great financial crisis. It can also sell shares to NatWest directly or in chunks. The current deadline for the UK to wash its hands of NatWest entirely is 2026. Some glaciers move faster.  Shares in the bank have dropped 9 per cent since the start of March to trade at about 267.70p. Banking stocks have been hard hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse’s shotgun marriage to UBS.  Economic secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Griffith, insists the government will achieve the “best value for the taxpayer”. But the idea the UK is ever going to sell out for a decent price relative to an average bailout price of 502p evaporated long ago. Recent declines will add to criticism of losses incurred.  UK ministers will plough on, but they should have made a clean break with NatWest years ago. The UK’s original 84.4 per cent holding was a legacy of financial mismanagement in banking and government. It was never an investment. The stake has created unhelpful conflicts of interest both for politicians and successive chief executives. During the two-year extension, up to 15 per cent of the aggregate total volume of NatWest shares traded in the market can be sold. Lex calculates that based on total volumes in the past two years more than 17 per cent of total shares outstanding could be offloaded. UK Government Investments, steward of the stake, has also been selling shares to NatWest via direct share buybacks. It previously sold larger chunks to investors via accelerated bookbuilds. These involve discounts. But it is hard to see the government meeting its target without more of them. The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

"Big US banks would lose $541bn in doomsday scenario, predicts Fed","Annual stress tests show lenders with more than enough capital to weather economic catastrophe","The largest US banks would lose $541bn in a hypothetical doomsday economic scenario but still have more than enough capital to absorb the losses, according to annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve. The passing grades given by the Fed on Wednesday to banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs lent support to claims from Wall Street executives and regulators that systemically important banks can withstand heavy losses.  The results will also help determine how much capital banks have to hold in the next 12 months. As long as banks match or exceed the requirements, they are free from Fed restrictions on how much capital they can put towards shareholder dividends and stock buybacks.  Analysts predicted the capital requirements of institutions such as Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America will decline due to the results. This bolstered hopes for higher dividends or more share buybacks, sending the banks’ stocks up about 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading.  The results come just months after three of the largest bank failures in US history — Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic — triggered a regional banking crisis. Smaller banks that have come under pressure from investors following the collapse of SVB, including PacWest and Comerica, were not included in the stress tests. “Today’s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,” Fed vice-chair for supervision Michael Barr said in a statement.  In a nod to the recent crisis, Barr warned the stress tests were “only one way to measure that strength” and said regulators “should remain humble about how risks can arise”.  The Fed stress tests are an annual exercise required under the post-2008 crisis Dodd-Frank financial regulations that gauge whether banks’ loss-absorbing capital ratios would remain above minimum requirements in the event of an economic catastrophe.  This year, banks needed to show they could withstand unemployment rising to a peak of 10 per cent, commercial real estate prices plunging 40 per cent, house prices declining 38 per cent and short-term interest rates falling to almost zero.   Of the 23 banks tested, Deutsche Bank’s US subsidiary suffered the biggest capital hit, followed by UBS Americas.   Goldman’s capital levels fell the most among the banks headquartered in the US, followed by Morgan Stanley. Both banks’ businesses skew more than peers towards trading, which is classified as riskier by the Fed.  The tests showed that all of the banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, State Street and Wells Fargo, would meet minimum capital requirements despite projected losses of $541bn. Of the losses, $424bn came from loan losses and $94bn from trading and counterparty losses.  The eight largest banks would suffer nearly $80bn of trading losses in a scenario with persistently high inflation necessitating steep interest rates, an environment not dissimilar to the current economic outlook.  The stress test results will help determine the so-called stress-test capital buffer for each bank. This is the amount of common equity tier one capital they must hold in excess of regulatory minimums relative to their risk-weighted assets.  The stress capital buffer is a combination of the maximum losses of CET1 capital during the stress test and the bank’s capital return plans for the next 12 months to shareholders through dividends.  The banks tested will be able to publicly confirm their indicative stress-capital buffer starting from Friday, when they may also reveal potential buyback or dividend plans.  Later this summer, the Fed and other US banking regulators will publish new international standards for calculating risk-weighted assets, known as the Basel III endgame rules.  Analysts and bank executives anticipate these rules, which will bring the US in line with international standards, will mean American banks will have to hold more CET1 capital. The Financial Services Forum, a Washington lobby group for the largest US banks, said the results underscored that lenders had sufficient capital and more stringent requirements were not needed. “The reforms of the post-Dodd-Frank period have achieved the goals of a stronger, safer banking system,” the FSF said in a statement. US regulators are also expected to expand the new Basel rules to include midsized banks of similar size to Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic.  The list of banks subject to the Fed’s stress tests has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of SVB’s demise due to its exposure to outsized interest rate risk stemming from its stock of unhedged bond holdings. Under the current rules, which were imposed in 2019 following legislation that loosened regulations on midsized lenders, SVB’s first official stress test would not have taken place until 2024. However, even if SVB had been subject to the Fed stress tests, it might have passed because the scenario did not model the kind of sharply higher interest rates that sparked the lender’s downfall.

"European banks: net interest income momentum will fade this year","There is a big risk European NIIs will undershoot the market’s expectations","Central bankers are meant to slow economies down by quietly removing the party punch bowl, not by pouring its contents over investors’ heads. A spate of US bank failures and the shotgun marriage of UBS and Credit Suisse point to just such a drenching. The MSCI European banks index fell nearly 13 per cent last month while the broader market managed a tiny gain.  Should central banks relent in their quest to quell inflationary pressures, just in case other banks collapse? A furious debate is raging on that point. In March, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England raised rates by a quarter point rather than half a point. The slow-moving European Central Bank went larger, then sounded a note of caution What is the outlook for European banks in this treacherous environment? Interest rate policy is crucial to performance via its impact on net interest incomes. These are boosted by higher rates in general - and by wider spreads between long- and short-term interest rates in particular. Another factor is the pace of credit growth.   For retail-focused banks such as Lloyds in the UK or Spain’s Sabadell, net interest income makes up 80 to 90 per cent of total revenues. The shares of both have done well since September. Barclays has an NII of 60 per cent of revenues. Its stock has gone nowhere. If inflation in the UK and Europe slows later this year, as Saltmarsh Economics forecasts, investors will expect NII improvements to do the same. February declines in inflation in Spain and France already hint at this. Loan repricing began late last year and should continue into 2024. European net interest margins should climb to 1.82 per cent in 2023 and go slightly higher in 2024, think analysts at Citi. The next question is what happens to credit volumes. The ECB says that during the last quarter of 2022 the “net tightening in credit standards was the largest reported since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011”. Lending to non-financial groups in the euro area is decelerating. The UK series was barely positive in February. There is a big risk European NIIs will undershoot the market’s expectations. The balance of opinion has an inertia all its own, which has yet to internalise recent left-field financial shocks fully. On that basis, European bank stocks look like a poor investment.

"Why Vice’s bankruptcy is a warning on private equity investment","Plus, the battle heats up between Icahn and Illumina and Cayman Islands defends itself as a go-to for the super-rich","One thing to start: London is the European stock exchange most at risk of suffering big departures to the US, according to a ranking compiled by the Financial Times. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter What the Vice bankruptcy says about private equityIcahn vs IlluminaThe Cayman Islands takes on Singapore and Hong Kong Vice, TPG and a private equity reckoning More than a decade ago, by Shane Smith’s telling, the Vice Media founder and Rupert Murdoch got drunk on tequila in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, bar. Months later, the billionaire’s 21st Century Fox group invested $70mn in the edgy and buzzed-about news start-up.  “News Corp, Time Warner, Bertelsmann, Condé Nast . . . everyone is after us,” he told the FT over duck confit in 2012. Now, many of the same titans of media and finance who joined the party and poured about $1.5bn into Vice over the years — the Murdochs, Disney’s Bob Iger, Sir Martin Sorrell and others — have been left with nothing but a brutal hangover.  They’re poised to lose almost everything as Vice prepares for a deal to sell the business to a consortium of lenders including Fortress Investment Group and Soros Fund Management. But it wasn’t the LSD-coloured dog shows or nights spent tripping on the world’s most powerful psychedelics that factored into the company’s eventual downfall. It was (depending on who you ask) private equity. Smith, who launched Vice as a counterculture magazine in 1990s Montreal, has never been afraid to move fast and take risks.  When private equity investors put nearly half a billion dollars into Vice in 2017, the media executive joked with reporters that he “rounds up” Vice’s $5.7bn valuation to $6bn “because it’s easier to say”.  But even for the swashbuckling and envelope-pushing media boss, partying with the Masters of the Universe proved to be draining. In 2017, a $450mn funding deal led by TPG and its then-partner Sixth Street was lauded as the gateway to an initial public offering or a multibillion-dollar sale. But the fine print revealed what some might consider a ticking time bomb, as the FT’s Anna Nicolaou and Sujeet Indap explain in this Big Read: preferred stock. Here’s how it works: by using preferred stock over common shares, TPG and Sixth Street could glean a 12 per cent dividend in the form of additional stock and junior debt rather than just cash. They also had other rights for priority payment, which contributed to a “complex and restrictive equity structure”, according to bankruptcy filings. “Private equity does this: they give you a high headline valuation. But the paper they give you is like a noose around your neck that gets tighter the longer you don’t have a liquidity event,” said one longtime shareholder, referring to either an IPO or a sale of the company. “If it goes past two years, forget it. They basically own the company.”  TPG maintains that Vice’s financial woes are of its own making. “Vice’s liquidity situation is a result of operating losses and the company’s inability to pay debt that was separate from TPG’s investment,” it added. Other investors and people close to Vice have echoed this, noting its freewheeling culture and knack for burning cash. However the blame should be divided, the saga is yet another reminder that the cheap money era is long over. Lossmaking start-ups are in for a rude awakening as interest rates continue to rise and private equity firms tighten the noose around companies that miss their profitability targets. Icahn scores a point against Illumina On the back of a bruising short seller attack by Hindenburg Research and a string of epic losses, Carl Icahn finally got a bit of good news. The down-on-his-luck corporate raider pulled off a partial victory in a proxy showdown against gene sequencing group Illumina on Thursday when shareholders voted to oust its chair, John Thompson, and approve Icahn’s nominee Andrew Teno for a spot on the board. Icahn’s gripes revolve around Illumina’s “reckless decision” to go ahead with its $8bn purchase of cancer screening group Grail without seeing whether it would be cleared by EU regulators under the purview of Thompson, a former Microsoft chair and director. The battle isn’t over, though. Two other Icahn nominees failed to win enough votes, paving the way for Illumina boss Francis deSouza and director Robert Epstein to be re-elected. In December, Brussels ordered Illumina to divest Grail and is planning to issue a fine worth up to $453mn for “gun jumping”. The US Federal Trade Commission has also ordered it to divest. Icahn’s campaign against Illumina is one of the biggest activist scraps in years. Since 2012, only seven US fights have gone to a vote at companies with a market capitalisation of more than $30bn, according to analytics company Insightia.  And it’s due to get messier. Icahn has called for Illumina to undo the “absurd and questionable” deal and oust deSouza, whose pay more than doubled in 2022 as Icahn revved up his campaign, “immediately”. Carl Icahn is targeting Illumina boss Francis deSouza, pictured © Jason Henry/FT After an ill-fated bet that the market would crash after the financial crisis has cost his publicly listed investment vehicle Icahn Enterprises $9bn over roughly six years, he’s not in a position to further lose out on his activist wagers. The 87-year-old activist may have admitted to DD earlier this month that those trades were a “mistake”, but admitting defeat is another thing. “I see this as only the first round in a continuing battle,” said Columbia Law School professor John Coffee. “The shareholders may yet be able to remove the CEO. But clearly the shareholders were nervous about giving Icahn even three seats on the board.” The Caymans fight back For the past few years, Singapore and Hong Kong have been trying to bring about a radical change to the way capital flows around the world, particularly when it comes to where Asia-based hedge funds, private equity funds and super-rich families park their assets. The two financial centres have set up new fund structures, which enjoy government subsidies and are lightly taxed. They look like a direct challenge to offshore centres such as the Cayman Islands. Now, the Cayman Islands is fighting back, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Mercedes Ruehl and Leo Lewis report. Its financial services minister André Ebanks visited Singapore and Hong Kong this month. He’s planning to set up a new office in one of the cities — he hasn’t yet decided which — that would help set up Cayman Islands-based funds. Officials in the British overseas territory “think there’s a threat to their position”, a Hong Kong-based funds specialist said. “They haven’t had as much competition before.” He and his colleagues are also trying to keep existing clients on side. A financier whose firm uses Cayman Islands funds told the FT the delegation wanted to reaffirm their relationship during their visit, in the face of what was likely to become sharper competition from Hong Kong and Singapore. The Cayman Islands “have one particular strength”, a Singapore-based executive who met the delegation said. “They are far away from the long arm of the Beijing government.” Job moves DWS chief financial officer Claire Peel has quit the Deutsche Bank-owned asset manager.Starling Bank founder Anne Boden is stepping down as chief executive in a surprise announcement she said was to remove any potential conflict of interest from her being a significant shareholder in the fintech.London Stock Exchange Group CFO Anna Manz is leaving to take a similar position outside the financial sector.The International Capital Market Association has named RBC Capital Markets executive Janet Wilkinson as chair and Crédit Agricole executive Jean-Luc Lamarque as deputy.UBS senior dealmaker Evan Riley is joining BNP Paribas head of equity capital markets for the US, per Financial News.

"Asset Management: Inside Scottish Mortgage’s boardroom bust-up","Plus, the ire of Credit Suisse bondholders, growing risks in commercial property loans, and After Impressionism at the National Gallery","One scoop to start: The US Securities and Exchange Commission has raised concerns over Rokos Capital Management after the hedge fund was forced to hand over large amounts of cash to its banks as collateral when an outsized bet on US government bonds backfired earlier this month. Welcome to FT Asset Management, our weekly newsletter on the movers and shakers behind a multitrillion-dollar global industry. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get it sent straight to your inbox every Monday. Does the format, content and tone work for you? Let me know: harriet.agnew@ft.com  Do asset managers live up to the standards they demand of others? When Amar Bhidé joined the board of Baillie Gifford’s flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust three years ago, an insider complimented the academic as a “world-class brain and a world-class bastard” who would take to task the £13.4bn company’s investment managers.  Bhidé departed in acrimony last week, chastising colleagues for a “natural avoidance of difficult questions after things have gone so well for so long”, as the FTSE 100-listed company announced a boardroom shake-up. Fiona McBain will stand down as chair after this year’s annual meeting, to be succeeded by senior independent director Justin Dowley.   Bhidé’s criticisms and the nature of his exit have sent ripples through the cosy world of investment trusts, a £268bn industry that forms a bedrock of pension portfolios. It also highlighted tensions over the direction of one of the UK’s most popular investment vehicles whose share price has halved over the past 18 months.  In a blistering attack, Bhidé went public with concerns about the length of McBain’s tenure; the board’s lack of investment expertise; its communications with shareholders; and the trust’s investments in unlisted companies that for most of the past decade produced exceptional investment returns. Bhidé argues those gains were an aberration rather than a new normal. “The world has not changed, it just went mad temporarily,” he told the Financial Times. The trust’s tumbling share price has reversed a decade of stellar profits from early bets on the likes of Tesla, Amazon and Alibaba, and the tailwind of loose monetary policy in the wake of the financial crisis. It follows the departure of James Anderson, the driving force behind Baillie Gifford’s investment strategy, who made a well-timed exit last year and was replaced by his co-manager Tom Slater, and Lawrence Burns.  The Edinburgh-based private partnership now finds itself at the centre of an embarrassing episode that spotlights the question of whether asset managers live up to the standards they demand of others. “The failure here is much more one of governance than of investment,” said the chair of a rival trust. “It’s bad for the overall investment trust industry.” Read our deep dive here, in which we delve into concerns over private company valuations, questions around governance and how the investment trust’s rising leverage levels may undermine its ability to make new investments in its portfolio of private companies like Northvolt. US bondholders vs Swiss government It has only been a week since Credit Suisse fell into the arms of UBS, in an attempt to prevent a crisis spreading across global markets. But the terms of the shotgun marriage has already provoked the ire of one group of investors, namely the holders of AT1 bonds.   The Swiss government used an emergency ordinance to write down $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds to zero, even as it orchestrated a deal where UBS will pay $3.25bn to shareholders.  Now US distressed debt investors and corporate litigators are preparing to fight the Swiss government over its decision. AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet.  “If this is left to stand, how can you trust any debt security issued in Switzerland, or for that matter wider Europe, if governments can just change laws after the fact,” David Tepper, the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management, told the Financial Times. “Contracts are made to be honoured.”Some funds have been buying exposure to the debt in preparation for the legal battle. Goldman Sachs is one of the banks facilitating claims trading and has offered prices at single-digit cents on the dollar.  Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing bondholders. Quinn partner Richard East told the FT the deal was “a resolution dressed up as a merger” and pointed to statements by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which distanced themselves from the Swiss approach.  Quinn is eyeing lawsuits in multiple countries. Potential avenues include challenges to the actions of the regulator Finma on the basis of a violation of investors’ property rights or an arbitrary exercise of discretion. The firm is also looking into whether Credit Suisse could be liable for mis-selling over statements made to investors. But don’t expect it to be an easy win, says one distressed debt specialist:  “Everybody knew it was in the small print — it’s not they didn’t read it, they took an optimistic interpretation. They felt that it would be a bridge too far for the debt holders to be treated worse than the equity holders.” He said that trying to bring this to litigation would be tantamount to saying, “Your Honour, I knew they could do it I just didn’t think they would. Those cases don’t win.”   Meanwhile don’t miss this Big Read on Credit Suisse: the rise and fall of the bank that built modern Switzerland, and another on how the Swiss “trinity” forced UBS to save Credit Suisse. Chart of the week  Commercial property loans are joining deposit flight and bond portfolios as the biggest perceived risk for US banks as rattled investors fret about lenders’ strength following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  Strains in the $5.6tn market for commercial real estate loans have deepened in recent months as the Federal Reserve’s year-long series of interest rate rises leads to sharply higher borrowing costs and weakening property valuations, write Jennifer Hughes, Harriet Clarfelt and Joshua Chaffin in New York. Analysts fear any further reduction in lending — say, from businesses more keen on hoarding deposits following two shock bank runs in a week — could make a perilous situation worse. Offices are seen as the area of biggest risk after tenants cut back on space to reflect the popularity of working from home following pandemic lockdowns. Thousands of small and medium-sized banks that make up the bulk of US lenders account for about 70 per cent of so-called CRE loans, according to JPMorgan analysts.  Most of the products are not repackaged for the asset-backed securitisation markets so remain on banks’ books. CRE loans make up 43 per cent of small banks’ total lending, against just 13 per cent for the biggest banks.  JPMorgan securitisation analyst Chong Sin warned in a note to investors: “The collapse of SVB is putting a magnifying glass on regional banks, and their commercial real estate loan books remain an area of major concern. Credit availability to CRE borrowers was already challenged coming into this year.”  A retreat from lending among smaller banks risked creating “a credit crunch in secondary and tertiary CRE markets,” wrote Sin. George Gatch, the chief executive of JPMorgan Asset Management has warned that commercial real estate is the next sector under threat from rising borrowing costs after bank failures and last year’s pension fund blow-up in liability-driven investing strategies.

"Credit Suisse sale ‘forever impairs’ ability of banks to issue AT1s, investors warn","Additional tier 1 bond market faces ‘risk premium repricing’ in wake of Swiss bank’s debt being written down ahead of equity","Some banks will struggle to issue a form of risky bonds used to bolster their capital and others will pay a much higher price for them after similar debt held by Credit Suisse was wiped out in its forced sale, investors have warned. Swiss regulators’ decision to write down $17bn worth of Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds as part of the bank’s purchase by UBS rather than wipe out shareholders has called into question the future viability of the $260bn segment of debt markets.  Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer of PGIM Fixed Income, said the fallout from the decision for banks “forever impairs the ability to issue AT1s”. He added: “There will be a continued risk premium repricing in that space.”  Stephen Ehrenberg, a portfolio manager for Barings’ investment-grade fixed income group, warned that higher costs could well lead to a segmented market. “You could see some of the strong UK banks and the Nordic banks continue to be able to access that market,” he said. “But you could see some of the weaker banks find that either they can’t access new issue or that the cost of doing so is too expensive.” In a sign of smaller banks choosing not to refinance at higher rates, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, a lender that specialises in real estate lending, decided not to call its AT1 bond last week, citing “market conditions and economic costs”. Kian Abouhossein, European banking analyst at JPMorgan, noted recently that most banks were paying 8 to 10 per cent coupons for AT1 bonds but should brace themselves for this “potentially rising into double digits”. If they find themselves effectively locked out of the market for AT1 bonds, some banks could be forced to rely more heavily on other sources of capital, such as equity, in order to meet regulatory requirements. Mark Holman, co-founder of TwentyFour Asset Management, said he did “not expect anybody to issue at current levels”.  “I don’t see why they would pay that much when they can grow equity in other ways such as through retained earnings,” he said. Some banks have issued AT1 bonds at less than 4 per cent coupon recently. “Looking at the underlying risks, that just doesn’t make sense,” said Rob Thomas, a credit research analyst at T Rowe Price.  AT1 bonds are a product of the global financial crisis, born out of regulators’ desire for banks to shift risk away from depositors, and to have greater capital requirements in case of failure.  Also known as contingent convertibles, or Cocos, the bonds can be converted into equity if capital ratios slide below a certain level, or written down entirely. Investors typically earn high interest in return for bearing these risks. The bonds form part of a bank’s tier one capital, which is the core measure of a lender’s financial strength and also comprises common equity tier one capital. CET1 and AT1 capital must comprise more than 6 per cent of a bank’s risk-weighted assets under Basel regulations. Tier 2 capital is the second layer of a bank’s capital and comprises assets such as hybrid debt.  While debt typically ranks above equity in a restructuring, Swiss financial regulator Finma upended the order of priority by giving SFr3bn ($3.3bn) back to Credit Suisse shareholders while wiping out AT1 bondholders. Joost Beaumont, head of bank research at ABN Amro, said the decision “will definitely leave its mark on the AT1 instruments”, adding: “I definitely think it will increase the cost of capital for banks.” AT1 bonds are perpetual, meaning the borrower has no obligation to repay investors. However, banks typically refinance the bonds with new issuance once an initial “non-call period” has expired, giving valuable flexibility to investors who can decide whether to invest in the new debt. More than $37bn worth of AT1 debt issued globally has call dates in April alone, according to Refinitiv data. If many banks decide not to call their debt, yields in the AT1 market could be driven even higher, analysts say.  An Invesco exchange traded fund tracking AT1 debt has fallen 19 per cent this month, underscoring the loss of confidence in the market. “In the short term we’re suffering from contagion and we’re suffering from a confidence issue,” said Holman. Reassurances from other European authorities that they would not follow in Finma’s footsteps have provided little comfort. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey distanced the UK from the Swiss actions, saying: “In any resolution, we will always abide by the creditor hierarchy because that’s a cardinal principle.” The European Central Bank previously said “common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses”. With their statement, EU regulators “really wanted to show in Europe this will never, ever happen . . . But then the question is, will investors really believe this?” asked Beaumont. One person involved in negotiating the Credit Suisse deal for UBS said the Swiss decision to change the rules was “rushed out to avoid a [winding down of Credit Suisse] and massive global contagion”. They added: “The AT1 market will reprice and we will pay a higher price for a while . . . At the moment, we are well capitalised and well buffered and we’ll be OK.” Ehrenberg agreed it would take time for the market to settle. “People come away from something like this and say ‘yeah, we’ve got these rules, but over a weekend a government can change the rules’. So I think there will be a need to regain some of that trust.” Additional reporting by Laura Noonan","29.03.2023"
"StanChart chief says Fed’s SVB deposit guarantee a ‘moral hazard’","Bill Winters’ remarks come amid US regulators’ efforts to reassure investors over curbing contagion in financial system ","The Fed’s decision to guarantee non-insured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank is “the most wonderful example of moral hazard we’ve come across for quite a while”, says Standard Chartered chief Bill Winters.  Winters’ remarks, made on Friday at a Hong Kong financial conference, come after US regulators pledged to protect deposits at failed Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. He added that there appeared to be “non-viable business models remaining, at least in the US”, with other banks that had similarly narrow customer bases.   The StanChart chief’s remarks are part of the debate over expanding US bank deposit guarantees, particularly if there is further deposit flight as a result of the current turmoil. The Biden administration is facing pressure from investors, entrepreneurs and some lawmakers to step in more forcefully to ensure all depositors are made whole, or risk other banks coming under pressure as customers rush to stash cash in larger institutions. Bank shares slid this week after Treasury secretary Janet Yellen ruled out a broad expansion of deposit insurance to protect savers with balances above $250,000 in the near term. Winters added that the Credit Suisse collapse and subsequent takeover by rival UBS has rattled the market. “At the end of the day, the common feature is lack of confidence . . . the issue isn’t so much does the regulator have confidence in our solvency, but it’s does the market have confidence in our liquidity?” The wipeout of Credit Suisse’s $17bn AT1  bonds triggered by its takeover deal has “profound” implications for the global bank regulations, he said, and raised questions about how regulators should assess the health of banks. “My observation to the three banks that have failed, is that they would appear to have been solvent,” Winters said. “There’s a lot of focus on the hierarchy question. But it’s not the big question. The big question is how do you wipe out $17bn of AT1s in a solvent bank without a review process?  “I think it had very profound implications for the regulation of banks and for the way banks manage themselves.” Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"Centerview: the Wall St power brokers confronting a rare rupture ","Boutique bank famed for its harmonious culture is dealing with a bitter lawsuit and the questions that come with success","David Handler made sure he signed the documents this time. Last summer, the veteran investment banker authorised and delivered a formal request to his then employer, Centerview Partners, seeking confidential details about its financial performance. He believed Centerview’s two founding partners, Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, had been seeking to expel him from the firm, depriving him of a Centerview equity stake potentially worth several hundred million dollars.  His request for financial information related to a dispute over a decade-old partnership agreement that Handler admits he never signed — but whose economic terms the founders had at least partially honoured ever since.   Handler had joined the New York-based boutique investment bank in 2008 as one of its first partners and both sides prospered as the firm grew to be an adviser to some of the biggest companies in the world. In its 17-year existence, Centerview acquired an envied reputation on two fronts. First, it earned staggering fees each year for advising on a disproportionate number of the largest transactions in the market despite keeping a modest headcount; in the boom year 2021, its revenues reached $1.5bn.   The other is that, until recently, it had largely avoided the kinds of internal psychodramas that have paralysed Wall Street’s biggest players, owing to what Centerview believes is its conscious effort to reward collegiality.  Centerview never shared the papers Handler requested. Last August, in response, he resigned from the firm, commenced legal proceedings and announced he was launching his own technology boutique, Tidal Partners, bringing with him nearly a dozen junior and senior Centerview colleagues.  Both sides are now litigating in a Delaware court over the bitter parting, each accusing the other of treachery. Handler in legal papers has described Centerview’s attempt to deprive him of equity as “surreptitious misappropriation” as reprisal for challenging the founders. The firm has countered that Handler took home “hundreds of millions of dollars” in pay during his years there and is owed nothing more, describing him as a “disgruntled employee” attempting to “divert attention from his own bad acts”.  Centerview also accuses him of a “shameful” breach of his employment contract by allegedly forming Tidal while still employed by Centerview.  The bitter dispute comes at a pivotal time for Centerview after years of spectacular success. Its admirers compare it to Lazard or Goldman Sachs before their respective IPOs — a close-knit circle of supremely connected power brokers quietly shaping commerce around the world.  “To be able to create such a firm from scratch is a rare accomplishment,” says Antonio Weiss, a former executive at Lazard. Others wonder if Centerview risks running out of road having become, as one former partner puts it, “too big now for what they were good at, but too small for what they want to be”. Rooms with a view Centerview was founded in 2006 by Effron and Pruzan along with Stephen Crawford, who had been chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley, and Adam Chinn, a prominent deals and executive pay lawyer from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. The foursome shared the view that the new firm must not bear their surnames, christening it Centerview to mark its original headquarters that overlooked the Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan.  Their mission was to act as a sounding board for chief executives, directors and the other decision makers at big or influential companies — not just intermittently on major transactions, but more consistently on continuing challenges.  Bob Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney. Several years ago, he received a presentation from Centerview, which he recalls being ‘articulated smartly’ and not simply ‘a sales job’ © Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Pruzan and Effron had previously been specialists in consumer products and packaged food companies but believed that thoughtful, senior-level advice untethered to any particular deal would resonate across other industries.  Bob Iger, the long-serving chief executive of Walt Disney, recalls a presentation that Centerview gave to senior managers at the entertainment group several years ago. “There was something about this presentation that was articulated smartly and wasn’t a sales job. I put Blair at top of the list in quality of analysis and authenticity,” he says. But prising boardroom doors open remained tough for a new firm with a limited record.  “The largest companies, when facing decisions of enormous opportunity but also risk, tend to look to firms that have established relationships and a brand and a history of advising on important decisions in similar circumstances,” says Weiss, the former Lazard banker. Robert Rubin, the former US Treasury secretary and longtime Goldman Sachs executive, who joined Centerview as a senior counsellor in 2010, says that in the early days he and Effron were often received politely, but discussions would often end in rejection: “I can’t do business with you, nobody has heard of you, and I couldn’t explain hiring you to the board and shareholders.” In that instance and others, the firm offered to complete a free project to showcase its abilities — this was often enough to overcome such initial resistance.  Centerview notched some big wins in the early years from old and new clients including advising the likes of AB InBev, Altria, Kraft Foods and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.     Yet its biggest coup was perhaps in hiring staff rather than signing up companies. The swingeing cuts to headcount at big investment banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis were a boon for boutique operators such as Centerview.  Big companies started rethinking the risks of relationships with massive financial institutions peddling credit lines, interest-rate swaps and other services alongside sensitive M&A advice. At the same time, a boutique banker would not be forced to market the latest derivative product du jour, nor find themselves at the mercy of esoteric trades gone bad from some distant corner of the firm. For the right person, who did not require the safety net of a sprawling institution, the independent model could prove liberating.  Junior and mid-level bankers were themselves uncommonly happy to work at Centerview with its above average pay, tight-knit culture and opportunity to interact closely with senior bankers and clients. Several made the successful transition from junior analyst or associate to partner. Robert Rubin, the former US Treasury secretary, says that when he joined Centerview in 2010, the company had to offer to complete projects for free to prove itself © David Paul Morris/Bloomberg “It was a blast; I loved that place,” recounts one person who started at Centerview in the early 2010s as an entry-level hire and stayed for several years. “I was surprised how nice Centerview was,” says another banker who had worked elsewhere before a near decade-long stint at the company. In the firm’s perhaps most consequential moment, in 2009 it hired three Merrill Lynch healthcare dealmakers: Alan Hartman, Mark Robinson and Richard Girling. This nascent healthcare group would quickly establish itself as go-to advisers to various big pharma clients including Pfizer. A few years later, Eric Tokat, a mid-level hire who had come with the Merrill Lynch team, would establish himself as the top banker to emerging biotech companies seeking to sell themselves, most notably the landmark sale of Kite Pharma to Gilead Sciences for $12bn in 2017.  Whatever Centerview’s stated aversion to simply processing transactions, the cash was rolling in. New analysis from a previous Financial Times study of deal fee regulatory disclosures filed between 2014 and 2016 showed a median Centerview fee of $30mn for each sale process. That figure was ahead of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, demonstrating Centerview’s pre-eminence in blockbuster situations.  Effron and Pruzan hired only a handful of senior bankers each year, leaving the windfall to be split among a small group who routinely could take home tens of millions of dollars annually. In the select circle was Handler. A self-sufficient star  Handler, now 58, had a clear sense of what consumed the attention of high-level corporate executives and directors. Among the reasons, when he was a junior banker in his twenties, he had so impressed the top brass of the listed casino operator, Penn National Gaming, now called Penn Entertainment, that they invited him to join its board where he remains today. As a deal adviser, Handler specialised in working with technology hardware companies at Bear Stearns and later UBS. In 2008, Effron brought Handler and his co-head of technology banking at UBS, David St Jean, to Centerview as the firm’s first non-founder partners.  John Chambers, as chief executive of the tech company Cisco Systems, was close to David Handler, leaning on his group for deal analyses © Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg Handler quickly scored big wins and was precisely the kind of colleague Effron and Pruzan needed. Handler had strong existing client relationships and was experienced enough to front pitches and board meetings without requiring the founders’ oversight. Handler was particularly close to John Chambers, then chief executive of networking giant Cisco Systems, whose internal strategy team leaned heavily on Handler’s group for deal analyses.  In 2016, Handler relocated to Palo Alto to establish Centerview’s first physical presence in Silicon Valley. In New York, he had become a successful but, at times, a polarising figure. His intensity was enough that some junior bankers balked. “He could grind them into the floor,” says one Centerview banker who knows Handler well. “David loves banking. He is the real deal . . . he lives and breathes it.”  The pandemic proved the flashpoint for an irreconcilable breach. Handler relocated to Miami in 2021 for family reasons. Others at Centerview believed that Handler preferred to stick to a handful of key clients, as the firm desired a more vigorous effort to tap a burgeoning sector. Soon after, Centerview hired a trio of Bank of America technology bankers to lead the Palo Alto office. Handler concluded that Pruzan and Effron were attempting to ease him out of the firm, even as his clients were announcing deals that would generate tens of millions in revenue for Centerview. David Handler quit Centerview in August and launched legal proceedings, while also announcing he was setting up his own technology boutique  His ire, according to court filings and interviews, is largely directed at Pruzan, the litigation inviting scrutiny of the respective roles of Effron and Pruzan within Centerview.  While the firm has eschewed formal leadership titles, a Centerview veteran describes Effron as the “outward-facing” chief executive who leads front-page deals, appears on television and at conferences and helps influence the debate on economic policy within the Democratic party — he, for example, counselled Iger when he was considering seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Pruzan, known as a master of complex deal structures, spent the 1990s at the storied boutique firm Wasserstein Perella and eventually became its president. He later started his own firm, Pruzan & Co, which was a predecessor to Centerview — Effron’s first paychecks were stamped “Pruzan & Co”. Although both co-founders have driven the firm’s culture, Pruzan takes the lead on internal management, a crucial function as the bank has widened to 500 employees and 70 partners.  Handler believed Pruzan had come to enjoy wielding power against him and his team. Effron, by then busy as perhaps America’s leading boardroom whisperer, himself had kept cordial ties with Handler.  Handler’s quarrel with Centerview could be traced back to his 2008 recruitment. Eager to get him to join, the firm had offered Handler and St Jean a generous package that included a significant split of the firm’s revenues and profits, irrespective of the technology group’s own performance. Both the firm and the tech group quickly rocketed and Handler each year pocketed tens of millions of dollars. By 2013, Effron and Pruzan had repeatedly attempted to recut Handler’s deal to moderate his near-term payouts. Negotiation sessions with Handler were held at the tony University Club in Manhattan and lengthy draft employment contracts were exchanged. The largest companies, when facing decisions of enormous opportunity but also risk, tend to look to firms that have established relationships and a brand and a history of advising on important decisions in similar circumstances Handler contends that eventually he agreed to reduce his annual earnings in exchange for what he believed was about 7 per cent of Centerview’s underlying equity.  Handler, however, never signed the agreement as the two sides could not hash out the restrictive covenants that should govern if he ever wished to leave the firm. Still, Handler maintains that his pay and stature in the subsequent years reflected the contract terms and that this posture implied the firm had tacitly approved the agreement. Centerview simply argues that no valid contract exists to enforce today. Its court papers add that even if an oral contract was legitimate, any equity he possessed could simply be repurchased by the firm at a nominal price, a standard provision that applied to any Centerview partner who departed the firm prior to an IPO or sale.  A July hearing in the Delaware Court of Chancery is set to resolve Handler’s initial request to review Centerview’s accounts as an alleged formal partner in the most valuable Centerview vehicle. Mutual regrets Those close to both parties say that, despite the harsh recriminations volleyed in legal filings, each laments that a 15-year relationship which had been wildly enriching for everyone had since descended into open warfare.  Handler’s Tidal Partners has begun to publicise its maiden deals. At the same time, Centerview continues to thrive. This year, it has found itself managing the sale of Silicon Valley Bank’s remaining assets, advising the board of Credit Suisse in the run-up to its state-brokered takeover by UBS, and assisting gold miner Newmont on its $17bn acquisition of Newcrest.  In April, it elevated two of its partners, both in their forties, to the newly created title of co-presidents, the first hints of a fresher generation beyond Effron and Pruzan. The founders are near 60, though neither is expected to soon slow down. One co-president is Tokat, part of the broader life sciences team that is the firm’s most reliable revenue stream. The other, Tony Kim, is an original Centerview banker who leads the consumer products practice and has been active in internal growth and operational projects.  Kim’s appointment has been universally hailed by Centerview insiders including Handler partisans who praised Kim’s integrity and leadership.  But the longer-term questions about Centerview’s future remain.  The fine line between glory and desperation has been on full display in 2023. The once-gilded private partnerships of Goldman Sachs and Lazard are now both subject to the unstinting glare of the public markets and have been forced into deep lay-offs this year.

Centerview’s founders have been reluctant to take the firm public, in part to protect its ethos © Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images The star of Greenhill & Co, the Centerview of the 1990s and early 2000s, fell far enough over the past decade for it to sell itself to Japan’s Mizuho for $550mn. The overnight implosions of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic are cautionary tales of hubris and fragility.  For now, there remains little hint of vulnerability at Centerview and it is making big pushes in the UK and France. But success invariably prompts its own questions. The firm has no outside capital and both Effron and Pruzan are likely to have accrued at least hundreds of millions in paper wealth.  The way to unlock the enormous wealth that Centerview has created for its partners while managing succession, growth and keeping the excitement of its early days will be its toughest puzzle.  Large underwriters have repeatedly pitched Centerview on an IPO, potentially valuing the group more than $5bn. The founders have demurred so far, in part to protect the firm’s ethos. Notably, France’s Rothschild & Co this year decided it will depart the public market. Zachary Karabell, author of a book chronicling the history of Brown Brothers Harriman, an elite US banking partnership that has lasted more than two centuries, reflects that the more successful a firm is, the trickier to maintain cohesion and specialness. “It’s better to stay private and closely held for as long as possible,” explains Karabell. “That is the only way to maintain control of the culture.”","30.05.2023"
"Calpers signals ‘appetite’ to increase bets on private equity","Biggest US public pension fund to begin extensive review of its $52bn of assets in the sector","Calpers, the biggest US public pension plan, is considering bigger bets on private equity despite growing fears that higher interest rates will curb the industry’s returns. Chief executive Marcie Frost said that the $442bn-in-assets retirement fund, one of the world’s biggest investors in private equity, will start an extensive review of its holdings in this sector next month, adding that there is “appetite” to increase its allocation.  The review of Calpers’ $52bn private equity portfolio will take place nearly nine months after Nicole Musicco, who started as chief investment officer last year, said a decision to put the pension plan’s private equity programme on hold for a decade between 2009 and 2018 had cost it up to $18bn of returns.  “If we [the Calpers board] had conviction that we could put more money into private equity, the appetite is there to do it from an investor perspective [and] from the investment office’s perspective,” Frost told the Financial Times. “That’ll be part of the asset allocation review.” Frost’s comments come as many investors worry about returns from the private equity industry, which has sucked in trillions of dollars of assets over the past decade. The sector is now facing much higher debt financing costs, a deteriorating global economic outlook and concerns about the potential for “stale” valuations lagging those of public markets. Last year the chief investment officer at Danish pension fund ATP compared the private equity industry to a pyramid scheme. Frost said that there was “a lot of debate” about private equity valuations, but believed the methods used to value Calpers’ portfolio were sound and the fact that private equity valuations were generally only reviewed every quarter was not a major issue for the fund.  “I don’t believe that there’s a problem with the quarter lag on the valuation, it really comes down to the processes that are used [for the valuation],” she said. “Our processes are quite sound . . . we have those done by outside entities.” Despite the challenges buyouts firms are facing, some investors are increasing their bets on the asset class in a bid to profit from cheaper valuations. Some of the best performing private equity returns were generated in the wake of the dotcom crash and the global financial crisis, according to PitchBook data.  At the start of the 2022/23 financial year, Calpers increased its target allocation for private equity from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. This could rise further if the review gives the green light. Calpers is keen to make new investments into private equity directly, rather than using external managers. Frost also said the fund is “seeing more deal flow opportunities” in private debt following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders, and that the fund was ready to take more risk to profit from such positions. “Based on current tightening in the banking industry, there are opportunities that we could pursue,” she said. “We are in a place where we have liquidity, we have a lot of dry powder that we can put to use,” she added. “So we think that as long as we have the appropriate underwriting, this is an opportunity even in a distressed environment.” Her comments come after a turbulent period for the banking sector, with Signature Bank and First Republic in the US also both collapsing and ailing Swiss lender Credit Suisse being taken over by rival UBS. The Federal Reserve this month warned of a “sharp contraction” in credit. Big private capital firms such as Blackstone, Apollo Global and KKR have been exploring ways to increase their exposure to private credit.  Frost said the fund was prepared for the extra risk that private debt investing could involve. “You’re not going to get the returns of 6.8 per cent [the scheme’s annual target] long term without taking on some risk,” she said.

This can be handy, or presumably less helpful if you’re, for instance, the lobby group Tech.uk. In some instances, it can be quite problematic.  Here’s a screen from some sellside research that recently landed in Alphaville’s spam folder:  Nigel Pittaway is a 23-year-veteran of Citigroup, where he is a managing director for insurance and diversified financials research. We are certain he does not wish to steal our personal details. The problem, as our overwrought lede may have given away, is Link Group. Link is a provider of services to Australia’s pension industry, and its ticker is LNK.AX. Several other Sydney listed companies have this same format, the .AX redolent of the top-level domain for, uh, Åland, Finland. Janus Henderson (JHG.AX), Perpetual (PPT.AX) and QBE Insurance (QBE.AX) all wear this linkability without issue. Unfortunately, LNK.AX is a valid hyperlink…  …one that leads to a website so nefarious that the wifi at Alphaville Towers won’t even let us look at it (we politely ask that the FT Cybersecurity team overlook us deliberately navigating to phishing sites).   Please don’t try to access it, and don’t blame us if you do.  For the sake of testing we forwarded one of Citi’s Link missives on to a nearby Bloomberg terminal (we politely ask that the FT Cybersecurity team overlook us theoretically phishing said terminal). At time of pixel, many hours later, it hasn’t appeared in the inbox (spam or otherwise). This may be seen as a good or bad thing, depending on whether you’re Citi’s research sales team. Who’s to blame here? It’s not really Citi, whose sent the ticker as plain text and whose on-site rendition of Pittaway’s Link dispatches bear no such hyperlink hyperactivity.  But pretty much any plain-text research note featuring Link Group’s ticker would have the same issue — and this is pitfall others seem to have avoided, judging by Alphaville’s collective inboxes (UBS and Credit Suisse coverage of Link both avoided hyperlink issues). A Citi spokesperson told us: The research in question, as published by Citi, does not include any third-party links. Which is great — although they’re going to have a problem if people continue to receive notes formatted this way.  Blame primarily has to lie with Google, whose helpful link generation is, in this instance, the digital equivalent of a cat bringing you a dead bird as a gift. Many email clients likely have the same issue, but we’re working with what we’ve got here. We contacted Google to why they would create an email system that generates hyperlinks to content it then highlights as malicious. We had not received a response at time of pixel. In conclusion: Link Group enthusiasts, read your Citi notes without fear — just don’t click that link.","26.04.2023"
"Why $17bn in Credit Suisse debt was wiped out","Plus, inside BlackRock’s warning to Silicon Valley Bank and Casino’s resident dealmaker makes another complicated M&A play","Two things to start: First, the Financial Times’ Stephen Morris and Due Diligence’s James Fontanella-Khan and Arash Massoudi give a blow-by-blow account of UBS’s historic rescue of Credit Suisse in this Big Read. The takeover will result in tens of thousands of job cuts at Credit Suisse, with its domestic unit and its investment bank taking the biggest hit, according to people familiar with UBS’s plans. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter The Swiss go cuckoo for cocosBlackRock’s warning to SVBCasino plays deal roulette Credit Suisse: don’t go chasing waterfalls Over the weekend we saw the most consequential bank deal since the 2008 financial crisis.   UBS agreed to buy its rival Credit Suisse for $3.2bn in a deal engineered by Swiss regulators to save the country’s second-largest bank. But the “real plot twist”, as one trader put it, came as investors that hold CS’s additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds were entirely wiped out as part of the deal.   Losses aren’t unusual in times of distress. AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or “cocos”, were introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to strengthen bank balance sheets and avoid bailouts funded by taxpayer money.  They’ve since exploded into a $260bn market and become a critical piece of the capital structures of European banking giants such as Deutsche Bank. What’s unusual, however, is that shareholders are walking away with $3.2bn while bondholders receive nothing. In situations like this, there’s something called a loss absorption waterfall, or a hierarchy of claims. Equity is almost always wiped out before bondholders are taken to zero.  Investors in the debt have been outraged by the move from Swiss regulators, with some claiming the decision is illegal. Law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said on Monday that it’s in talks with a large block of debtholders about possible legal action.  To make matters worse, CS told employees that it will continue to hand out bonuses and pay rises as planned this year, despite being saved from the brink of bankruptcy.  On the face of it, it appears to be a pretty big infraction by Swiss regulators — there’s a pecking order and people are expected to follow it.  But unless you’re talking to bondholders themselves, the rest of the market seems to be pretty unsympathetic. That’s mainly because AT1 bonds are known to be risky, hence why some CS AT1 bondholders were getting yields of 9.5 per cent. The offering documents made no assurance that equity would get wiped out first, or that terms are standard across jurisdictions. Indeed, a contractual provision states AT1s can be written down if the issuer, in this case CS, is deemed “non-viable”.  This could all end up being debated in court. Lex notes that the debacle raises questions over how effective AT1s are for their intended purpose — bolstering balance sheets. On Monday, the FT team that broke every big story on UBS/CS got to the bottom of the AT1  “plot twist”.  They were slaughtered in order to make CS shareholders happy to receive any return. “AT1 holders were sacrificed so the finance ministry could try to save some face with international equity holders after denying them a vote on either side of the transaction,” a banker advising on the takeover told the FT. Inside BlackRock’s warning to Silicon Valley Bank Before its collapse this month, Silicon Valley Bank had been warned by the world’s largest asset manager that its risk controls were poor.  BlackRock’s consulting arm warned SVB, the lender whose failure helped spark a banking crisis, that its controls were “substantially below” peers and lagged competitors in almost every facet, DD’s Antoine Gara and Brooke Masters report in an explosive scoop.  SVB hired BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory Group to study its risk controls and received a “gentleman’s C” in a brutal assessment delivered to the bank’s top brass in January 2022.  SVB lagged behind similar banks on 11 of 11 factors considered and was “substantially below” them on 10 out of 11, said people familiar with the matter. It was also unable to generate real-time or even weekly updates about what was happening to its securities portfolio. Instead of sounding alarm bells inside the bank, the assessment was largely ignored. SVB listened to the criticism but rebuffed offers from BlackRock to do follow-up work. SVB’s collapse is now the subject of a Federal Reserve review led by Michael Barr, its vice-chair for supervision. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where SVB chief executive Greg Becker was a board member, also found risk deficiencies, The New York Times reports. BlackRock’s review also missed an opportunity to correct course on SVB’s catastrophic decision to build a $91bn securities portfolio of long-dated debts.  In October 2020, BlackRock analysed how SVB’s securities portfolios would respond to factors including rising interest rates. But the review used inputs selected by SVB and studied rate increases of just 1-2 percentage points. No models considered a scenario where rates went higher — as they ultimately did — or how that would affect its deposits. BlackRock’s consultation concluded in June 2021. While no recommendations were made, the report was influential internally. It “confirmed the direction management was on” in buying long-dated assets carrying higher yields to bolster short-term profits, said one former SVB executive. The former executive called it “an opportunity to highlight risks” that had been missed. Casino makes another complex gamble for survival There’s always another hand to play at the casino of Casino, the deeply indebted food retail group controlled by former star executive and noted financial engineer Jean-Charles Naouri.  Jean-Charles Naouri is part of a generation of French businessmen who have used complex financial engineering to build business empires via debt-fuelled acquisitions © Reuters The 74-year-old executive is cooking up a complex deal that would merge Casino’s French food retailers with Teract, a company founded by his old business partner Moez-Alexandre Zouari and two prominent French businessmen via a Spac deal last year. It’s an effort to save what remains of his empire ahead of a wall of debt that comes due starting next year. Not everyone is convinced, however, as shares have fallen by more than a quarter in the past month. One hedge fund manager who has been short Casino said the “half-baked deal announcement” was an attempt to distract from the group’s cash burn.  But the pair’s longstanding relationship may have made Zouari the only person who could convince Naouri to loosen his grip on Casino, said people close to the deal. “Until now the other deals Naouri had to choose from were all going to hand him a loss,” Zouari told the FT, referring to previous suitors Carrefour and Auchan. “People don’t understand that he is not just a financier, he is very attached to the company he built.” Job moves Karen Miles, Credit Suisse’s head of high-yield trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has joined Deutsche Bank as European head of high-yield trading in London.Separately, Credit Suisse execution services executive Charlie Whitlock has joined algorithmic trading group XTX Markets as head of Americas distribution in New York.InterContinental Hotels Group chief financial officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson has joined UK betting group Flutter as CFO.Bank of America has named Mike Browne and Anand Melvani as co-heads of its leveraged finance business in the Americas.

"Will jobs data put further pressure on the Federal Reserve?","Market Questions is the FT’s guide to the week ahead","Will the pace of US hiring slow? Hiring in the US is forecast to slow in May, following months of gains that have helped make the case for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high. The labour department is expected to report on Friday that the US added 193,000 jobs in May, according to economists polled by Reuters, down from the 253,000 jobs added in April, but above the level added in March. The unemployment rate is expected to be up slightly at 3.5 per cent, although still hovering around 50-year lows. Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 per cent month over month, lower than the 0.5 per cent recorded in April. The data will be a crucial part of the Fed’s deliberations when it next meets in June. Although the central bank has indicated it may be ready to pause its historic cycle of rate increases, odds in the futures market are split on whether or not the it will raise interest rates one more time. Persistent inflation has kept pressure on the Fed, and a strong jobs market — which typically suggests higher wages — is one source of that inflation. Kate Duguid Can China’s manufacturing sector return to growth? With the consensus on China’s growth outlook now decidedly dim, markets will be on lookout for any signs of an economic uptick — in particular, any outperformance by the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index on Wednesday.  Despite strong spending by consumers during the long Labor Day holiday, economists polled by Bloomberg expect the gauge of factory activity to come in at 49.6 for May, up slightly from last month’s reading of 49.2 but still below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction. Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI, which includes the services and construction sectors, is tipped to tick down a full point to 55.3. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs say the weak readings from April may only be a blip, despite advance signs of sluggish underlying growth. They predict a rebound to 49.8 for manufacturing, just shy of ending contraction, and expect non-manufacturing activity to rise to 57 on the back of a strong rebound in travel during the holiday. Surprise strength — or weakness — could move the offshore exchange rate of the renminbi, which trades primarily in Hong Kong and is subject to fewer restrictions than the onshore rate. Last week strategists at UBS repeated their recommendation to short the offshore exchange rate against the dollar, euro and yen, noting that with “China’s May activity tracking weak, the [offshore rate] looks vulnerable to further weakness”. Hudson Lockett Is eurozone core inflation still rising? A sharp fall in eurozone inflation figures for May is unlikely to provide much relief for European Central Bank policymakers, who will be more focused on the stickiness of core price pressures beyond energy and food. The headline rate of eurozone inflation is set to fall to 6.1 per cent, down from 7 per cent in the previous month, when the figures are released on Thursday, according to Goldman Sachs. However, core inflation would only dip from 5.6 per cent in April to 5.5 per cent in May, Goldman forecast. The introduction of a subsidised €49 monthly public transport ticket in Germany will only partly offset increases in holidays, air fares and other travel prices, Goldman added.  Several members of the ECB governing council, including the heads of the German, French and Dutch central banks, last week said they expected to raise interest rates at least a couple more times to keep downward pressure on core price inflation. “We do not expect the drop in core inflation, if it materialises, to meet the threshold required by the ECB to pause rate hikes,” economists at BNP Paribas said in a note to clients, adding that rate-setters have said “a sustained decline in core inflation is needed to pause hiking”. Services prices — which make up almost two-thirds of core inflation — are set to continue rising close to the eurozone record rate of 5.2 per cent reached in April, BNP Paribas predicted, because of “tight labour markets and wage growth that doesn’t show any signs of abating”.

"A second life for electric vehicle batteries is a challenge for the industry","Big part of the EV supply chain is still being worked out","Nam Juny spent three decades exporting used Korean vehicles and car parts all around the world before spotting an opportunity in the nascent global battery market. In 2018, the 57-year-old scrapyard owner, a veteran of defunct conglomerate Daewoo’s trading division, founded Bastro, a Seoul-based start-up that repurposes EV batteries for other uses. His logic is simple: an electric vehicle battery dies twice — once when it can no longer power a vehicle, and again when it can no longer power anything else.  The second life is often overlooked. A battery is no longer suitable for use in a vehicle once it has been reduced to about 70-80 per cent of its original capacity. But it will still have the potential to be used for other purposes, ranging from lighting streets and homes to powering appliances and offering energy storage.  Bastro takes EV batteries and turns them into portable power units that homes can rely upon in the event of power cuts. This is an example of “upcycling” — repurposing a battery without breaking it down into its constituent parts rather than “recycling”, which involves dismantling discarded cells and reconstituting them into a fresh supply of metals. For a “circular economy” in batteries to emerge, they must ultimately be recycled. But Nam argues that battery recycling is a complex, dirty and energy-intensive process that should be delayed for as long as possible. “I have a principle of ‘10+10’, meaning that the average EV battery should be able to do 10 years in a car, followed by 10 years serving some other purpose,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at his workshop in Seoul. “For batteries to be sent for recycling when they are only halfway through their life is a terrible waste.” Despite this, it is unclear how regulators will ensure that batteries are made available for “upcycling” before they are eventually dismantled. That may not be a problem right now when the number of used EV batteries is relatively small, but it is likely to emerge as an issue over the course of the decade as EV adoption takes off in Europe and North America. “This is a huge aspect of the industry that simply hasn’t been worked out yet,” said Tim Bush, a Seoul-based EV battery analyst for UBS. Many of the challenges faced by Nam in Seoul help to illustrate some of the issues that will probably be faced by the wider industry. One is safety. Bastro’s power units are made from repurposed nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries in which the leading Korean battery makers specialise. But NMC batteries have an unfortunate history of catching fire, and all the batteries he uses require exhaustive testing before they can be used by consumers. “If just one of my units were ever to catch fire in someone’s home, we go bankrupt and I go to jail,” he said.  Bush noted that in the future the testing of used EV batteries will have to be instituted on a mass scale not only for safety purposes, but also to establish the value of individual batteries. “For a car with an internal combustion engine, you have an odometer, and you can look and see how many miles this vehicle has done,” said Bush. “But with a battery, there isn’t necessarily a relationship between the number of miles driven and the state of health of the battery.” “What’s going to matter is how the battery was charged and the temperatures it was charged under, as well as how the vehicle has been used.” Nor is it clear who is best placed to capture the value in the upcycled battery supply chain. Battery makers, recyclers, manufacturers, dealers, leasing companies, insurance companies, scrapyard owners and individual vehicle owners may all find themselves jostling for position in this new market. Individual consumers who have bought their vehicles, for example, may be content to allow EV manufacturers to buy the batteries back off them. Another solution is for the manufacturers to retain ownership of the battery. But if a driver has no stake in the future of a battery, they may have no incentive to take care of it. The fewer batteries are left in a state to be reused, the greater the environmental toll of the EV supply chain as a whole. In the meantime, Nam is focused on developing his products and expanding his network of scrapyards as he waits for the supply — and demand — for used batteries he has long predicted to materialise.   “We make products out of batteries that still have 70 to 80 per cent of their capacity, but only cost 10 to 20 per cent of what they cost when they were new,” said Nam. “We are turning bronze into gold.” christian.davies@ft.com","20.06.2023"
"FirstFT: Banks pass Fed’s annual stress tests","Also in today’s newsletter, last-ditch attempt to save Microsoft-Activision deal and China’s carmakers’ European push","Shares in the US’s largest banks rose in after-hours trading after they passed the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests, paving the way for buybacks and raised dividends for shareholders. Of the 23 banks tested, Deutsche Bank’s US subsidiary suffered the biggest capital hit, followed by UBS Americas. Goldman Sachs’ capital levels fell the most among the banks based in the US, followed by Morgan Stanley. Both banks’ businesses skew more than peers towards trading, which is classified as riskier by the Fed.   The tests showed that all of the banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, State Street and Wells Fargo, would meet minimum capital requirements despite projected losses of $541bn. Smaller banks that have come under pressure from investors following the collapse of SVB, including PacWest and Comerica, were not included in the stress tests. This year, banks needed to show they could withstand unemployment rising to a peak of 10 per cent, commercial real estate prices plunging 40 per cent, house prices declining 38 per cent and short-term interest rates falling to almost zero.  The stress test results will help determine the so-called stress-test capital buffer for each bank. This is the amount of common equity tier one capital they must hold in excess of regulatory minimums relative to their risk-weighted assets.  The banks tested will be able to publicly confirm their indicative stress-capital buffer starting from tomorrow, when they may also reveal potential buyback or dividend plans.

"The Great T2 Escape","Some CS junior bondholders were touched by Tyche","The biggest winners from the Credit Suisse implosion (apart from FTAV’s swag shop) are clearly holders of the bank’s Tier 2 bonds.* We can’t quite say why though. The $16bn Credit Suisse Additional Tier 1 bonds are by now famous, with Switzerland’s decision to take them out back and shoot them as a political sacrificial lamb to improve the combined UBS-CS financial metrics earning the country the wrath of aggrieved investors. Yet, weirdly, Europe’s new “banana republic” and “pariah” has (so far) decided not to touch Credit Suisse’s $2.5bn Tier 2 capital bond — despite it also being explicitly bail-in-able.   That has led to this absolutely beautiful chart, with the bond (which matures on August 8) going from trading at 98 cents on the dollar last week to a low of under 50 cents and back to 96 cents at pixel time as it appeared to escape the CS obliteration scot-free.   In the lump-eating rankings, T2s get hit after AT1s, but the main difference is that only perpetual bonds are allowed to be classified as AT1. T2 bonds have a maturity date, but are still explicitly also designed to be loss-absorbing and bailed in or wiped out in a crisis. And as you can see, Credit Suisse’s T2 has very similar terms (full prospectus here) to the AT1 bonds that were completely vaporised.  Specifically, the stipulated “write-down event” is similar, with the bond prospectus stating that the Swiss financial regulator can determine that the bond needs to be wiped out if Credit Suisse requires “extraordinary support from the public sector”.  The Swiss relied both on this (controversial) contractual interpretation and an (even more controversial) emergency ordinance to write down the AT1s. So why didn’t they do it with the T2 bond, which was chunky and maturing in less than half a year? The best/funniest argument we’ve heard is that they just forgot about this issue, and by the time someone realised it was best to just pretend this was all deliberate. Better explanations in the comments below.  * Fixed throughout to delete a dumb reference to “additional” tier 2 capital. They’re just known as Tier 2 bonds.

"Federal Reserve/ECB: credit tightening has not yet done its worst","Trend of using expensive high-yield bonds to refinance the disappearing supply of bank loans has begun","Throughout economic history, interest rate tightening cycles tend to end with a bang, not a whimper. Whether the multiple bank failures in the past two weeks were loud enough is moot. US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell raised rates by a quarter rather than a half percentage point on Wednesday. The Bank of England increased by the same amount on Thursday. The question is whether any more increases will follow. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde, who defended rate rise policy last week, softened her tone this week. Though European bank shares have dropped recently, they are up 7 per cent in the year to date, helped by rising rates and the boost to their net interest income (NII). The Stoxx 600 European bank index has royally outperformed the KBW US bank index.   Some say stricter European regulation, including tougher capital buffers, has made all the difference, despite the woes of Credit Suisse, forcibly sold to UBS last weekend. Liquidity was what mattered there. Contagion and deposit withdrawal can occur rapidly. An avalanche of withdrawals can quickly turn into a credit crunch as banks pull back on lending. Credit markets are already fragile. Bank of America’s high-yield spread index has widened by a quarter to 500 basis points over risk-free rates in March alone. Trading volumes in secondary debt markets have plummeted. Primary issuance has vanished altogether. Borrowing is as costly as it has been in a decade. Any further rate increases would ignore the impact of previous rises. US Fed rates have climbed more than twice as fast in the past year as they did in the run-up to the financial crisis. Everywhere, bank lending rates are still catching up with central bank policy rates. Since the ECB began tightening last summer, only half of that increase on average has passed on to borrowers as of January this year, according to S&P. A trend of using expensive high-yield bonds to refinance the disappearing supply of bank loans has begun.  Bank investors can sense a shift, pricing in a peak in NII growth, the driver of bank profits. Every 25 bps shift in ECB rates drives a 4 per cent move in earnings per share on average, says Citigroup. A lagged effect on loan pricing should keep NII rising this year in Europe, but probably not in 2024. This boom period for Europe’s banks could be as good as it gets.

"US equities gain as banking fears take back seat to Fed","Investors turn focus to next rate decision as Treasury secretary Janet Yellen signals backing for regional lenders","US stocks advanced on Tuesday as investors appeared to be assuaged by efforts to reduce the risk of contagion in the financial system and looked towards the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision. The blue-chip S&P 500 index added 1.3 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.6 per cent, rising for a second day. The KBW Nasdaq Bank index gained 5 per cent, while beleaguered California-based lender First Republic climbed 29.6 per cent, having fallen by nearly a half on Monday.  Banks have steadied after regulators moved to support lenders caught in financial sector tumult following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and two other US lenders this month. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen signalled on Tuesday the government would back all deposits at smaller US banks if needed.  Sam Gunter, head of FX trading at Britannia Global Markets, said: “Over the past few days there has been a continued sentiment of support for the banking sector, including from [European Central Bank president] Christine Lagarde saying they would act on inflation and financial stability, and Janet Yellen showing her support for regional banks. “That’s why we’re seeing equity markets push up and safe haven assets like gold and the yen lose ground.” Investors are turning their attention to decisions on interest rates from the US and British central banks this week. Turmoil in the global banking sector has eased expectations about the scale of interest rate increases to combat inflation.  The Fed decision will come after a two-day meeting that started on Tuesday. Futures markets predicted on Wednesday the US central bank would raise rates by 0.25 percentage points from its current level of between 4.50 per cent and 4.75 per cent.  Gennadiy Goldberg, US rate strategist at TD Securities, said Yellen’s comments about protecting regional US banks have freed up the Fed to focus on cooling inflation by raising interest rates, rather than pausing to calm concerns about banking instability. “If there are more announcements from Treasury and the government overall, I do think that could stabilise the market and actually allow the Fed to continue to tighten policy,” he said.  “If they stop hiking now, it’s going to be pretty tough for them to restart rate hikes . . . By hiking 25 [basis points], it almost maintains the optionality to continue hiking in future meetings.” The Bank of England meets on Thursday, but pricing from the swaps markets indicates investors are divided between a 0.25 percentage point increase and no change. “The question now is whether banking sector problems are enough to tip the BoE into holding rates,” said analysts at Bank of America. “Greater uncertainty over the economic outlook as well as potentially tighter credit conditions could therefore tip the BoE into holding rates.” The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which closely follows interest rate expectations, jumped 0.22 percentage points to 4.17 per cent on Tuesday while the yield on the 10-year note rose 0.11 percentage points to 3.59 per cent. Yields move inversely to price. Yields on two-year German Bunds leapt 0.31 percentage points to 2.63 per cent, while the 10-year notes rose 0.2 percentage points to 2.29 per cent. European stocks also extended their gains on Tuesday as investors took heart from regulatory moves to contain the risk of contagion in the financial system from weak banks.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index closed up 3.8 per cent, having gained 1.2 per cent in the previous session. Broader indices also advanced, with the region-wide Stoxx 600 rising 1.3 per cent, Germany’s Dax 1.8 per cent, France’s CAC 40 1.4 per cent and London’s FTSE 100 1.8 per cent. Credit Suisse and UBS, which announced plans to merge in a Swiss government-brokered deal on Sunday, rose 7.3 per cent and 12.1 per cent, respectively.  As part of the merger deal, $17bn worth of Credit Suisse additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds, a type of higher-risk bank debt designed to take losses during a crisis, was wiped out, Swiss financial regulator Finma said at the weekend. That triggered a sell-off in AT1 bonds at other financial institutions on Monday, as investors worried that bondholders would have to take on bigger losses than shareholders of Credit Suisse, who were allocated UBS stock. “It is still very early days. The initial response [to the deal] was not positive but statements from the supervisory arm and policymakers seemed to have been taken pretty well,” said Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics. “We’re still in a weaker position but there are tentative signs that things aren’t getting worse.” In Asia Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed up 1.4 per cent and China’s CSI 300 gained 1.1 per cent. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.4 per cent. Japanese markets were closed for the spring equinox holiday. Asian banking stocks also gained, with the Hang Seng Finance index adding 1.4 per cent. HSBC and Standard Chartered gained 1.7 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.  Spot gold prices fell 2 per cent to trade at $1,939.50 per troy ounce after briefly touching their highest level since March 2022 on Monday.  Oil prices continued to increase after rising more than 1 per cent on Monday. International benchmark Brent crude, and US equivalent WTI, gained 2.1 and 2.5 per cent, respectively.","21.03.2023"
"Saudi Arabia seeks to boost oil price with output cut of 1mn barrels a day","Opec+ members agree new deal which will reduce quotas for weaker African states","Saudi Arabia will cut oil production by 1mn barrels a day in a bid to prop up oil prices, it announced after a fractious meeting of the Opec+ group of producers in Vienna on Sunday. The kingdom’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Opec’s de facto leader, made the move as part of a deal in which several weaker African members will have quotas reduced from next year. Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter, could also have its production targets lowered, though the group said this was subject to review. Meanwhile, the UAE will be able to increase its production. Oil prices have slid in the past 10 months despite several attempts by producers to tighten supplies. The kingdom and other members announced a surprise cut in April but, after briefly rallying towards $90 a barrel, prices again reversed, falling to nearly $70 a barrel at one stage last week.  Oil prices jumped on Monday morning. International benchmark Brent crude added 1.1 per cent to trade at $76.98 per barrel, while US equivalent West Texas Intermediate rose 1.3 per cent to $72.66. WTI had earlier jumped as much as 4.6 per cent while Brent peaked 3.4 per cent higher. The 1mn b/d cut will initially be for July but could be extended, Prince Abdulaziz said. He described it as a “Saudi lollipop” or sweetener for the group, whose other members were spared from making additional cuts this year. “We want to just ice the cake with what we have done,” the minister said. “We will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market.” The reduction will lower Saudi Arabia’s output to 9mn b/d in July, and comes in addition to a voluntary 500,000 b/d cut announced by the kingdom in April, when its output was around 10.5mn b/d. Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS who attended the meeting, said it was a “strong statement” from Saudi Arabia because 9mn b/d was a “very low” production level for the kingdom. Its maximum output capacity is close to 12mn b/d. “It is very low in the context that we are not in a global recession,” Staunovo said.  “It is a clear signal that they want to achieve, as they say, ‘market stability’.” According to IMF estimates, Riyadh needs an oil price above $80 a barrel to balance its budget and fund some of the “giga-projects” that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes can transform its economy. The Opec+ group’s collective production targets were adjusted to 40.5mn barrels a day for 2024, formalising and extending the voluntary cuts announced in April at the group level. The distribution of cuts was contentious, with many African members initially resisting efforts to revise down their production baselines. These are supposed to reflect their maximum output capacity and are used to calculate the size of cuts they must make. Weaker Opec members, including Nigeria and Angola, had already been struggling to reach existing output targets after years of under-investment, and were reluctant to make deeper cuts. But the UAE has been pushing for a higher production baseline, reflecting investments in its industry. Its production target will increase by around 200,000 b/d from January to 3.2mn b/d. Angola, Nigeria and others will have their targets reduced, though analysts say that this will only reflect what they can produce and should not remove a significant number of barrels from the market.  According to the deal, Russia could also have its production targets reduced, depending on the findings of a review of current output levels by independent specialists. “We, as always, find common ground,” Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said as he left the meeting. Opec has faced criticism for its alliance with Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, and for trying to prop up prices during an energy crisis triggered by Moscow’s actions. The decline in oil prices since October may have made the White House more sanguine about further production cuts, however, according to analysts, as the US tries to mend ties with Saudi Arabia. In a sign of the pressure on the Saudi energy minister, who is a half-brother to the kingdom’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed, several journalists, including entire teams from Reuters and Bloomberg, were blocked from attending the weekend’s meetings. Opec secretary-general Haitham Al Ghais said they had let in other journalists from around the world but indicated the group would continue to choose which reporters it invites, saying, when pressed about the decision: “This is our house.” Additional reporting by William Langley in Hong Kong","05.06.2023"
"Banks prepare for deepest job cuts since the financial crisis","Firings expected to be ‘super brutal’, with Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley already laying off staff","Banks are gearing up for the biggest round of job cuts since the global financial crisis, as executives come under pressure to slash costs following a collapse in investment banking revenues. The lay-offs — which are expected to be in the tens of thousands across the sector — reverse the mass hirings banks made over the past few years and the reluctance to fire staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The job cuts that are coming are going to be super brutal,” said Lee Thacker, owner of financial services headhunting firm Silvermine Partners. “It’s a reset because they over-hired over the past two to three years.”  Banks including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon have begun to cut more than 15,000 jobs in recent months, and industry watchers expect others to follow suit, emboldened by the headline-grabbing plans already announced. “We’ve seen some warning shots from the US,” said Thomas Hallett, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “Investors need to see management acting on cost and trying to maintain a reasonable return profile. The Europeans will tend to follow the US banks.” Ana Arsov, co-head of global banking at Moody’s, said she expected the job cuts to be less severe than during the financial crisis, but heavier than the collapse in the markets after the dotcom crash in 2000. “What we are seeing is a catch-up of normal bank lay-offs that were put on pause over the past few years,” she said. “We will see trimming in European franchises, but not as big as at US banks.”  Bank executives said Goldman’s eye-catching lay-offs — part of its biggest cost-cutting drive since the financial crisis that includes everything from corporate jets to bonuses — had set a precedent that other banks would look to follow.  “The Goldman headlines are accelerating decision making,” said an industry executive with knowledge of several banks’ plans. “It’s a good time to announce painful cuts if you just follow Goldman.” The Wall Street bank began a process of firing up to 3,200 staff last week, equating to 6.5 per cent of the workforce, as pressure mounts on chief executive David Solomon to improve the bank’s return on tangible equity. Goldman is cutting a similar number of staff as it did in 2008 during the depths of the global financial crisis, but its workforce then was two-thirds of its current size. Morgan Stanley laid off 1,800 staff in December, just over 2 per cent of its workforce. Despite having a strong wealth management business, the lender’s investment bank suffered along with its fierce rival Goldman Sachs from a near halving of M&A revenues last year. Morgan Stanley said no further staff cuts were imminent. “We were frankly a little overdue,” chief executive James Gorman told analysts. “We hadn’t done anything for a couple of years. We’ve had a lot of growth, and we’ll continue monitoring that.”  Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank, plans to cut just under 3 per cent of its workforce — around 1,500 staff — in the first half of the year. Chief executive Robin Vince told the Financial Times that the bank had been “very careful to recognise” that letting people go during the Covid pandemic would have “broken the social contract” with employees. But he added that “in the ordinary course of business we review staffing levels. As a well-run business we have to be good stewards of our expense base.” By far the biggest cuts announced so far are by Credit Suisse, which is in the middle of a radical strategic revamp aimed at solidifying the scandal-plagued Swiss bank. Last October, the bank said it would be eliminating 9,000 roles from its 52,000 workforce over the next three years. While 2,700 of the cuts were planned last year, the bank has already begun redundancy consultations over 10 per cent of investment banking roles in Europe, the Financial Times reported last week. Credit Suisse, in the middle of a strategic revamp, plans to cut 9,000 roles from its 52,000 workforce © Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg The size of the restructuring at Credit Suisse is greater than the bank went through during the financial crisis, when it was forced to lay off more than 7,000 staff in 2008 but avoided a state bailout. Not all banks expect to make large reductions to headcount, though they are taking other measures to keep costs down. Bank of America, which employs 216,000 globally, said it did not “have any plans for mass lay-offs”, though it was taking a disciplined approach to costs and would only hire for the most crucial roles. Chief executive Brian Moynihan told Bloomberg in Davos that fewer people had left the bank than it expected last year, which was affecting its recruitment policy. “We overachieved on the hiring side and we went past our target headcount,” he said. “And now we can do a slowdown in hiring.”  Citigroup has so far given few details about how many of its 240,000 global workforce will be affected by lay-offs, but chief financial officer Mark Mason told journalists that there was pressure to cut costs within its investment bank, following the division’s 22 per cent fall in profits. “As part of [business as usual], we’re constantly combing talent to make sure we have the right people in the right roles and where necessary to restructure, we do that as well,” he said. Yet at least one global bank is looking to beef up its ranks, albeit in a targeted way. UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers said at Davos that the Swiss lender was “bucking the trend” when it came to recruitment. UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers says the Swiss lender is ‘bucking the trend’ by hiring rather than firing © Hollie Adams/Bloomberg Unlike its rivals, UBS has not hired aggressively in recent years and so is not under the same pressures to cut roles. It has also dedicated more resources to wealth management over the past decade and senior executives at the bank feel now is a good time to invest more in the investment bank — along with hires in wealth and asset management — as competitors pull back. These efforts include picking off disgruntled dealmakers from boutique advisory firms, senior figures at UBS told the FT. By comparison, UBS was forced to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in 2008 — with most roles coming from its investment bank — as the lender was bailed out by the Swiss government after suffering heavy losses on subprime mortgages.  Several of the biggest job cuts in 2008 came from banks that had rescued rivals brought to their knees by the financial crisis. When Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch, for example, it fired 10,000 staff, while also making 7,500 workers redundant at mortgage lender Countrywide Financial.  JPMorgan let 9,200 Washington Mutual staff go when it took on the US’s largest savings and loan association, in addition to cutting a 10th of its own workforce. Meanwhile, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns led to tens of thousands of bankers out of work. In total, more than 150,000 bankers lost their jobs during the financial crisis. And just like 15 years ago, the prospect of quickly finding re-employment for those now out of work is bleak, according to recruiters. “You have this horrible flood of quality coming on to the market, but who picks them up?” said Thacker. “The buyside isn’t there to hire these people this time. They just don’t have the capacity.” This story has been amended to give the correct timeframe for the job cuts at Credit Suisse ","21.01.2023"
"India’s central bank holds interest rates amid global banking turbulence","Reserve Bank of India stresses move to break monetary tightening cycle is ‘pause, not a pivot’","India’s central bank has held its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in an unexpected move that came amid banking turbulence in the US and Europe, renewed oil price volatility and as the country’s robust economic growth showed signs of abating. Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank’s six-person monetary policy committee had voted unanimously on Thursday to maintain the repo rate at 6.5 per cent, defying expectations of a 0.25 per cent rise and breaking a tightening cycle that began last May. The RBI is the second major central bank to hold rates this week after Australia opted to keep rates steady on Tuesday following 10 consecutive rate rises. Central bankers worldwide are trying to balance concerns about worsening economic conditions with persistent inflation, which has hurt consumer spending.  India’s Sensex equities benchmark ticked up 0.25 per cent. Although the global economic picture has brightened this year, Das said the “outlook is now tempered by additional downside risks from financial stability concerns”. He emphasised that Indian banks “remain healthy” amid a backdrop of the takeover of Credit Suisse by Swiss rival UBS and recent banking collapses in the US. Economists had expected the RBI to raise rates one more time, as India’s inflation had softened in February to 6.4 per cent but remained above the bank’s upper tolerance level of 6 per cent. Das stressed that the pause in rate rises was “for this meeting only” and that the decision was a “pause, not a pivot” as he stressed that “the war against inflation has to continue”. He said the central bank was waiting to observe the economic impact of the 250 basis point increase in the repo rate over the past six meetings. The RBI also set its gross domestic product growth forecast for the financial year beginning this month at 6.5 per cent, up slightly from its previous 6.4 per cent outlook but lower than its forecast of 7 per cent growth for the current financial year.  “Overall we are optimistic about the Indian economy,” said Das, who highlighted risks from external factors such as the shock Opec oil production cut this month.  India’s gross domestic product growth rate slowed to 4.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Analysts have highlighted weakening consumer spending, among other concerns. The RBI on Thursday said that “private consumption showed some signs of slowdown”. Amar Ambani, head of institutional equities at YES Securities, said the RBI’s growth forecasts were “over-optimistic”, citing a consensus estimate of 6 per cent. He added that he expected 6.5 per cent would now be the terminal rate.","06.04.2023"
"Liontrust in talks to buy Swiss rival GAM","UK asset manager makes approach as industry pressure to consolidate intensifies ","UK boutique fund manager Liontrust is holding takeover talks with troubled Swiss rival GAM, highlighting the pressure facing smaller asset managers to bulk up.  Liontrust, which has £33.8bn in assets under management, said on Tuesday it was negotiating with GAM after making an approach to the board. Terms of a potential deal were not disclosed. GAM has been racing to find a buyer after twice delaying its results, the Financial Times reported last month. It has failed to recover from a 2018 scandal over its holdings of private debt, which led to fines, the exit of its chief executive and a collapse in its market value.   Its share price has plunged 96 per cent since the start of 2018. Last year the group hired UBS to help sell the business. The travails of GAM have come during a period of intense pressure on smaller asset managers, as the expansion of passive investment hits fees and costs rise. Several have turned to consolidation to increase scale, secure growth and tap into new markets and distribution channels.  But sceptics highlight that asset management deals are often tricky to pull off because of the challenge of integrating different cultures, structures and back office systems.  Historically, Liontrust has been aimed at retail investors. Under chief executive John Ions, the group has already done several deals, including the acquisition of Majedie Asset Management in 2021, the purchase of the UK investment business of Architas in 2020, Neptune Investment Management in 2019, and Alliance Trust Investments in 2017. David McCann, analyst at Numis Securities, cautioned that shareholders should treat any tie-up between Liontrust and GAM with “scepticism”. “We would assume that cost-cutting/synergies would be a major part of the rationale, given that GAM remains meaningfully lossmaking with its current cost base,” he said.  McCann added that recent Liontrust acquisitions — notably Majedie and Architas — “have not been great from a shareholder value perspective”.   Liontrust’s approach for GAM follows a striking fall from grace for the Swiss group. Once one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, GAM’s troubles began in July 2018 when it suspended former star fund manager Tim Haywood with little explanation, prompting investors in its Absolute Return Bond funds, which Haywood managed, to rush for the exit. It later transpired that Haywood had bought bonds relating to Lex Greensill’s now collapsed supply chain finance business Greensill Capital, which counted former UK prime minister David Cameron as an adviser.  Insiders at Zurich-based GAM had voiced concerns about Haywood’s relationship with Australian financier Greensill, which ultimately led to the liquidation of the funds. Chief executive Alexander Friedman stepped down while Haywood was subsequently fired. In 2021 GAM was fined £9.1mn by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for conflicts of interest.  The current chief executive, Peter Sanderson, joined at the end of 2019 and has tried to cut costs. A statement from GAM on Tuesday confirmed it is “in discussions” with Liontrust, “among others.” It said that the board is working “on options to ensure that the firm is strategically positioned in the best interests of all stakeholders.” Talks between Liontrust and GAM were first reported by Sky News.

"Wall Street wavers ahead of Big Tech earnings","Investors appear cautious with corporate updates and data due later in the week","US stock markets seesawed on Monday as investors continued to digest first-quarter earnings from some of the world’s biggest companies and eyed looming updates from Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, among others. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3 per cent lower. Morgan Stanley’s US equities team noted that stocks were generally performing well going into the current earnings season, putting them at risk if investors start focusing on the increasingly cautious outlook from executives.  “For our more tactically oriented clients, we think this dynamic poses a near-term risk for stock prices given our more pessimistic outlook for earnings this year, especially as the liquidity picture becomes less accommodative,” they wrote in a note to clients. Shares in Coca-Cola slipped 0.2 per cent after the drinks group reported net revenue growth of 5 per cent in the first quarter. The latest earnings from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon this week are likely to be the focus of investors’ attention. Big Tech has held up well even as US interest rates have continued to climb — a factor that has propped up the wider market. Microsoft is up 18 per cent year-to-date, while Amazon has gained 29 per cent. The S&P 500 has added just over 7 per cent so far. Bed Bath & Beyond slumped 39 per cent to 18 cents a share after the home goods group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday. US government debt edged higher on Monday, pushing the yield on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasuries down 0.04 percentage points to 4.14 per cent and the yield on the benchmark 10-year note 0.06 percentage points lower to 3.51 per cent.  Strategists at BMO noted that volumes were just over half of recent averages. Moves are likely to remain muted ahead of first-quarter gross domestic product figures due on Thursday and closely watched inflation data on Friday.   The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide interest rates. While a quarter-point rise is largely priced in, investors are looking beyond that to the potential for rate cuts later in the year.  An index measuring the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major currencies fell 0.3 per cent.  China-related bourses started the week on the back foot, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index down 0.6 per cent and the Hang Seng Tech index giving up 0.2 per cent, although it had traded as much as 1.1 per cent lower earlier in the session. A report from Bloomberg last week suggested US president Joe Biden was poised to further restrict American companies’ ability to invest in critical parts of China’s economy — a move that would once more raise concerns about the effect of ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two countries. China’s CSI 300 fell 1.2 per cent, dragged lower by basic materials, property and consumer non-cyclicals. Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 and London’s FTSE 100 both fell less than 0.1 per cent. The moves came as Credit Suisse announced it suffered SFr61.2bn ($68.6bn) of asset outflows in the first quarter. Shares in UBS, which agreed to take over Credit Suisse last month, rose 0.8 per cent.","24.04.2023"
"The Lex Newsletter: the banking crisis phase II","Plus, Twitter, Lyft, United Utilities, Next","This article is an on-site version of The Lex Newsletter. Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader,  After a flurry of panicky movement in credit default swaps last week, markets are now acting as if the banking crisis is old news. Regulators are pointing blame and UBS has a new chief executive. The Lex team took this moment as an opportunity to step back and think about the strength of the global banking system.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s failed bank list shows how common banking failure is in the US. Map global failures on global economic downturns and it is clear when most occur.   None of that is a surprise. The question is whether it is possible to do something with this information. Are the post-financial crisis rules aimed at making the banking system safer still fit for purpose? Should deposit insurance be expanded? If regulators reassure all depositors that their money is safe, will it maintain faith in the system or remove any incentive for executives to act responsibly and guard against risk?   Lex readers were vocal in their view that the collapse of US regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS need not trigger a shift towards depositors bearing the brunt of failure. There were a few votes for greater personal liability for executives and auditors. Lex says: don’t hold your breath.  The clean-up continued this week with North Carolina’s First Citizens taking over Silicon Valley Bank. There are advantages to being one of the only suitors in town. From a $9bn market cap to taking over tech’s erstwhile favourite bank with a $72bn loan book and $56bn of remaining deposits, plus protections in case of further deposit flight and a loss-sharing deal on loan losses.  For regulators, the pressing question is which, if any, banks are at the greatest risk of failure. In the US, regional banks have less cash on hand than at any point since the crisis. Our Lex in depth shows how crucial it is that depositors feel secure enough to put their money back into the country’s broad array of smaller banks. Lex has screened more than 150 US banks for asset resilience, deposit liquidity and investor sentiment. We found that the weakest were Wisconsin’s Associated Bank and Valley National of New Jersey.  Analysts we spoke to had a gloomy warning too. Commercial real estate may be the next point of pressure on bank balance sheets. “The liquidity crisis will pass,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies. “But a credit crisis is coming.” Maybe, mused Lex, borrowing activities should shift from deposit-taking institutions to the securities market. But debt markets seizure means the change is some way off.  Tweet decked The crisis in tech stocks will ease if banking failures encourage a slowdown in interest rate rises. Meta (previously known as Facebook) is undergoing a remarkable recovery from the depths of its crash. Shares are only down 7 per cent over the past 12 months.   Alas, the same cannot be said for Twitter. Those of you who use the social media site will know that Elon Musk’s attempts to improve it have had limited success so far. The “For You” tab was supposed to drive more interactions between accounts that do not already follow one another. On mine its purpose seems to be primarily to promote Musk’s own tweets.  Twitter says that next month it will remove pre-existing verifications, meaning only those who pay a monthly subscription will get a blue tick. The number of users who have opted for this so far is estimated to be about 0.2 per cent of total users. Most are small accounts. It is unclear (and unlikely) that the politicians, celebrities and other well-known figures whose use of the site gives it prominence will choose to pay.  Confusion is coming. This is why Lex questions the company’s decision to apply a $20bn valuation. Yes, it is less than half the figure Musk paid last year. But revenue is crashing and the company is losing money. Use the same forecast sales valuation metric as social media site Snap and Twitter would be worth $12bn — $1bn less than the size of its debt.  We hold out little faith in the prospects of San Francisco ride-hailing company Lyft. The basic model of charging users to catch rides remains unprofitable. A new chief executive plucked from the board is unlikely to arrive with a plan to reverse this and catch up to bigger rival Uber. Lex thinks a sale may be the only outcome.  No big tech company is likely to step in, however, even if share prices are climbing. The size of companies such as Amazon and Alphabet remains an uncomfortable topic for regulators. In China, ecommerce giant Alibaba has opted to divide itself into six parts. It is a move US companies may one day echo.  Each part of Alibaba will have its own chief executive and the ability to list. Logistics has been tapped as one of the first likely to spin off. But Lex thinks the six may well remain under Alibaba’s umbrella. The appearance of independence would still soothe regulators.  Water rotter Stories of sewage dumping in British rivers, lakes and canals roll on. The prospect of wild swimming grows less appealing by the day. Yet the valuation of water utilities is in line with historical averages, at a premium of 15 per cent to adjusted regulatory capital value. That seems like wilful ignorance. Costs are rising. Either companies or households will take the hit. Barclays predicts that £100bn of capital expenditure required across the industry will mean a 60 per cent increase in bills.   On the high street there are no such illusions. High street fashion retailer Next produced a good set of annual results. But investors hold out little hope of growth.   A service designed to host other retailers online accounts for less than 2 per cent of revenue. Opportunities for future expansion are evaporating, according to the company. That’s the sort of bracing reality water companies would do well to follow.  Stuff I liked this week In keeping with the banking theme I saw the play The Lehman Trilogy this week. It tells the story of how Lehman Brothers evolved from a shop in Alabama to the heart of the financial crisis and is excellent (if long). Fun headline from the Wall Street Journal on Disney and Microsoft saying “meh” to the metaverse. Though let’s keep in mind that even Meta didn’t think the metaverse was imminent. It was, and still is, a bet on the future.  Atlantic writer Helen Lewis’s Bluestocking newsletter has a nice list of writing tips. I liked the reminder to distinguish between plot and story.

"Letter: Making profits is just one central bank responsibility","From Stefan Gerlach, Chief Economist, EFG Bank, Zurich, Switzerland; Former Deputy Governor, Central Bank of Ireland, 2011-15","Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (“Central banks are not there to make profits”, Opinion, February 7), is right to argue that central banks are not for-profit institutions, but no serious commentator has asserted that. The key issue is rather what they should do when they experience unavoidable losses. As he notes, central banks can operate with negative equity. Because of that, in a financial crisis they can vacuum up risky assets that they are much better able to hold than the private sector. The Swiss National Bank’s brilliantly executed decision to take over illiquid assets from UBS at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and sell them at a profit in 2013 is a case in point. But their ability to operate when a company would be bankrupt also raises the issue of what they should do when they experience losses. To facilitate budget planning, ministries of finance across the world prefer central banks to smooth their profit transfers over time. In Switzerland, that is a requirement of the National Bank Act. The much harder question is whether a central bank that makes a loss should cease to transfer past profits.   And should they do so, even if they have positive capital after the profit transfer? As Carstens notes, central banks have a mandate to operate in the public interest and, I hasten to add, not their own.

But the FT hasn’t stopped paying attention. This week our colleagues Ryan McMorrow, Eleanor Olcott and Kana Inagaki revealed that his sprawling conglomerate SoftBank had moved to sell almost all of its remaining Alibaba stake as the market downturn hammered its technology investments. The $7.2bn worth of sales were made through prepaid forward contracts, an analysis of regulatory filings sent by post to the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed. The trades will eventually cut SoftBank’s stake in the $262bn Chinese ecommerce group to just 3.8 per cent. The transactions follow a record $29bn in stake sales last year as Son unwound a bet that had cemented him as one of the world’s greatest technology investors more than two decades ago.  SoftBank, which declined to comment on the regulatory filings but said the Alibaba stake sales reflected its shift to “a defensive mode”, has little choice but to cut its position in the Chinese group as it reckons with the global tech rout. It’s one of SoftBank’s major liquid assets. Son has had to play defence after a number of losing bets. DD’s Rob Smith did the maths in November, finding that Son owed SoftBank nearly $5bn on loans the company had made to him. He’s also taking heat from analysts and governance experts, who raised concerns over a deal SoftBank inked just this week. The company on Wednesday announced it would sell its South Korea-based venture capital arm — SoftBank Ventures Asia — to a company founded by Son’s youngest brother, Taizo Son.  SoftBank Ventures Asia, which manages about $2bn in assets and has invested in more than 300 companies since its founding, was dealing with similar troubles as other SoftBank investment vehicles, including the Vision Fund. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, disturbed experts who took issue with the fact it was just the latest interaction that included a member of the billionaire’s family. SoftBank had previously invested in Taizo Son’s mobile games start-up GungHo. A company founded by Taizo Son, brother of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, bought SoftBank’s South Korea-based venture capital arm © Bloomberg Son didn’t participate in the approval process over the sale of the venture capital unit and the company said it had taken appropriate governance measures. While “technically” there was no conflict of interest issue with the latest deal, “there is an ‘optics’ problem”, said corporate governance expert Nicholas Benes. “Even if it is a small deal . . . Mr Son’s shadow was in the background, even if he wasn’t physically in the room.” Scandal and strife at the CBI When Tony Danker took the helm of the CBI in 2020, he pledged to improve rock-bottom relations with Boris Johnson’s government after the British business advocacy group had been sidelined for its anti-Brexit stance.  But any success the former Guardian executive and McKinsey & Company consultant may have had has since been overshadowed by serious misconduct allegations at the organisation, which he himself has allegedly contributed to. Danker was fired as the CBI’s director-general on Tuesday following a probe into allegations of sexual harassment made against him by a female employee. The episode amounts to “an existential challenge for the UK’s pre-eminent business group”, as the FT’s Helen Thomas argues. Previously envied for its access to senior public officials, the government is now distancing itself from the group, which represents some of the biggest names in corporate Britain, including Tesco, Unilever and Barclays. Even before his own alleged misconduct came to light, Danker had inherited an institution already suffering from a toxic workplace culture. Earlier this month, the CBI disclosed that it was expanding an investigation at the group unrelated to Danker, over allegations of sexual harassment, cocaine use and rape. More than a dozen women, all of whom are current or former employees of the CBI, claim to have been victims of various forms of sexual harassment by senior officials at the organisation. One alleges she was raped at a summer staff party on a boat on the Thames in 2019, while another claims to have been sexually assaulted at the same event. The industry trade body has since announced a cultural overhaul and encouraged people to come forward with other concerns given its serious “organisational failure”. Danker responded to his sacking on Twitter by saying he was “truly sorry” that he had “unintentionally” made colleagues feel uncomfortable but said the allegations had been “distorted”. He added he was “shocked” that he had been “dismissed from the CBI, instead of being invited to put my position forward as was originally confirmed”. His replacement Rain Newton-Smith, who served as the CBI’s chief economist until March, has already been met with some resistance by former employees and affiliates of the CBI. They have questioned if she’s fit for the role given she was in a senior position during the alleged incidents. “The reappointment of the previous leadership team so swiftly, without due process, when they all said they heard and saw nothing is crass,” said a senior figure at an affiliated trade body. The focus will be on whether Newton-Smith can revive a trade body representing some of the most powerful companies in the UK, just as fears over a poor business climate hit an apex.

"Credit Suisse: chaos means slow rate rises and simpler rejig are needed","Swiss lender’s near-collapse shows that central bank policy is hurting the financial system","Chaos theory proposes that a butterfly flapping its wings in one place can cause a tornado in another. Similarly, the recent failure of a niche California US tech lender this week pushed an unrelated Swiss bank close to collapse. Time for central bankers to acknowledge that with risks unpredictable, rate policy must be more cautious. The crash of Silicon Valley Bank and a financial crisis at Credit Suisse were reactions to globally rising rates and connected via contagious panic.  This forced the Swiss lender to go cap in hand to the Swiss National Bank 350 metres down the street in Zurich. The SNB has put up SFr50bn ($54bn) in extra liquidity. Presumably, some big counterparties were shunning Credit Suisse despite a tolerable liquidity coverage ratio.   A reason would be slumps in the price of Credit Suisse senior bonds. One soon-maturing dollar bond with a 3.8 per cent coupon was at peak stress yielding a theoretical 150 per cent according to Refinitiv. That would explain why the bank has trumpeted the repurchase of SFr3bn of bonds. Disaster has been averted. But Credit Suisse appears critically wounded. That bond was still yielding a notional 87 per cent on Thursday morning. The one-year credit default swap, which fell 1,000 basis points, remained very high at 2,900. Shares jumped 23 per cent but did not recoup fully the week’s drop.  None of this will reassure clients of the key wealth management arm or their suave advisers. Deposit outflows will continue.  Credit Suisse says it will continue with a complex restructuring. The market and the SNB will be the judges of that, one suspects. A cleaner rejig is needed, perhaps involving UBS. The aim should be to split off the relatively stable Swiss retail bank. Revenues there — 32 per cent of the group — fell about a tenth to SFr3.7bn in the year to end 2022. On a peer group average of 7 times earnings it could still conservatively be worth SFr9bn. Even after Thursday’s jump, that exceeds the market value of the whole group. Western central bankers have meanwhile established that their current rate trajectory is breaching a pain threshold for the financial system. Potential bank collapses must now counterweight the ill-effects of inflation in their thinking. That is good for gold and commodities — and bad for ordinary consumers.

"Schrödinger’s swap: the audacious plan to trigger Credit Suisse’s CDS","So crazy it might just work?","Can a bond that no longer exists trigger a default? This is the quasi-metaphysical question facing the panel of experts who have to determine whether Credit Suisse’s credit-default swap contracts will pay out. Call it Schrödinger’s swap.  While most in the market had assumed that Switzerland’s decision to vapourise $17bn of Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 bonds would not trigger the bank’s CDS (for reasons we’ll get into below), a couple of US hedge funds have wagered that nearly everyone has overlooked crucial quirks in the derivative contracts that could lead to a payout.   Bloomberg revealed last week that FourSixThree Capital and Diameter Capital Partners have loaded up on Credit Suisse CDS aiming to profit from a ruling that the swaps have in fact been triggered. On Thursday, a question was lodged with the Determinations Committee — the all-powerful panel of market representatives who make often-controversial rulings on whether credit-default swaps pay out — asking whether a so-called credit event has occurred at Credit Suisse (CDS aficionados will have noted that the question went in just a few days shy of the 60-day deadline after the AT1 bonds were written down).  The rationale behind why these funds are betting on a payout is not yet public, however. Bar some clues in the phrasing of the question submitted to the DC and the supporting documents attached, the wider world is none the wiser as to why two sophisticated hedge funds believe most of the market has missed a seismic event in the world of CDS. In a bid to fill this void, FT Alphaville has spoken to several players with knowledge of the trade in order to set out as clearly as possible the thorny argument in favour of a CS CDS payout. We can’t promise that the explanation will be straightforward. But you know you’re in for a wild ride when the supporting materials include documents as esoteric as a bond prospectus from the year 2000 and a more than a century old New York court judgment.  Tiers for fears Before we get into the nitty gritty of the argument in favour of a trigger, it is first worth explaining why the majority of CDS traders had assumed there would be no payout on the Credit Suisse swaps. CDS contracts written against bank bonds have two main classes: senior and subordinated, referencing the debt at the top and bottom of the capital structure, respectively.  You might naturally assume that when Swiss authorities wiped out $17bn of Credit Suisse’s deeply subordinated AT1 bonds, as a condition of the bank’s shotgun wedding to UBS, it would trigger payouts on the latter set of contracts. Indeed, the International Swap and Derivatives Association overhauled the standard CDS contract definitions in 2014 to include a new “governmental intervention credit event” to cover exactly this sort of eventuality (one of the reasons for the overhaul was a fiasco surrounding the CDS of Dutch bank SNS Reaal the previous year, where swap holders received no payout even after the government zeroed its subordinated bonds). The problem is that bank capital structures are rather more complicated than just being split into “senior” and “subordinated” bonds. There are multiple tiers of debt. And for the purposes of subordinated CDS, it is the Tier 2 bonds that matter. This is because AT1 bonds, which banks only first started issuing around a decade ago, have a number of structural features that make them incompatible with CDS. For example, their perpetual maturities (which mean they never have to be repaid) clash with the requirement in standard CDS contracts that the relevant bonds have a maximum maturity of 30 years. This distinction did not matter the first time that AT1 bonds were written down in Europe — in the case of Banco Popular in 2017 — because regulators zeroed the Spanish bank’s Tier 2 bonds in tandem. This led to a full payout for those who had bought CDS protection on Banco Popular’s subordinated bonds. In the case of Credit Suisse, however, Swiss authorities left its Tier 2 bonds completely unscathed (rather miraculously, given that the Tier 2 debt had an incredibly similar writedown clause to the Swiss bank’s AT1 bonds).   With the Tier 2 bonds unimpaired, it seemed logical that there would be no payout on Credit Suisse’s subordinated CDS contracts. Or so you might have thought. Y2K bug The first hint that all might not be as it seems comes from the fact that among the supporting documents in this week’s question to the DC is the offering circular for a £250mn subordinated bond that Credit Suisse’s US subsidiary issued in the year 2000. Students of banking M&A history may be interested to discover that these bonds were issued to fund the acquisition of US investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, back when an expansionary Credit Suisse First Boston was trying to make deeper inroads into the US junk bond market:  Crucially, however, this bond matured back in 2020. How can debt that no longer exists have any bearing on Credit Suisse’s CDS contracts in the here and now? The answer lies in one of the many ways that bank capital structures have become even more complex as the result of the global regulatory framework introduced following the 2008 financial crisis. On top of the standard capital requirements, globally significant banks also need to have a certain amount of bonds that can be easily written down in a crisis, not-so-catchily known as “total loss-absorbing capacity”. To fill up these buckets, banks began issuing a new tier of bonds that ranked between senior and Tier 2. In the EU, banks mostly opted for so-called contractual subordination, where bonds are issued from the same entity and their contracts specify different orders of priority. Rather than giving them the more logical name Tier 3 bonds, bankers christened this new class of debt with the rather oxymoronic moniker “senior non-preferred”. In the UK and Switzerland, however, banks instead adopted structural subordination, where bonds are issued out of different entities to determine their order of priority. While traditional senior bonds were issued from the main banking entity, the new bonds were issued out of a holding company. The two classes of debt became colloquially known as “OpCo senior” and “HoldCo senior” respectively. The shift created even more complexity for European bank CDS, with different contracts emerging to reference the differing ways the two tiers of senior debt were issued across the continent. It means that for Swiss CDS, the distinction between bonds at the HoldCo and the OpCo matters. And Credit Suisse’s subordinated CDS references Credit Suisse Group AG (the HoldCo) not Credit Suisse AG (the OpCo). You would probably expect that the relevant bond for this contract (the “reference obligation” in CDS parlance) to be the Credit Suisse Tier 2 bond that escaped a writedown in March. And yet that bond’s offering memorandum makes clear that this bond is an obligation of Credit Suisse AG, not Credit Suisse Group AG:  At this stage it makes sense to turn to the “Standard Reference Obligation list” maintained by IHS Markit to get a definitive answer on the contract’s relevant bond. And lo and behold, it lists the £250mn bond issued in 2000 that matured in 2020:  A quick check of the bond’s prospectus shows that in contrast to the Tier 2 bond, it was guaranteed by the same entity that the subordinated CDS references, Credit Suisse Group:  While it might seem deeply weird for CDS to reference a bond that no longer exists, ISDA’s standard CDS definitions do allow for this possibility, with the concept of a “prior reference obligation” for situations where no reference obligation is outstanding.  So, incredibly, it could well be the bond we need to look most closely at in determining whether there has been a CDS default. Unwritten ranking? So far, so strange.  But you could be forgiven for still wondering what relevance this legacy bond has to Credit Suisse’s AT1 wipeout. After all, it goes without saying that a bond that was repaid nearly three years ago was not written down as part of the UBS merger. The next clue lies in the fact that the DC has not only been asked to rule on whether a governmental intervention credit event has occurred at Credit Suisse Group. The question submitted to the panel has a supplementary query: “The Eligible Market Participant who submitted the question noted that in order to determine the DC Question the EMEA DC would need to determine whether the AT1 bonds were Not Subordinated to the Reference Obligation or the Prior Reference Obligation and asks the EMEA DC to consider this point in connection with the DC Question.” This is relevant because it is not only a default on the specific “reference obligation” that leads to a CDS payout. The swaps should also be triggered if the borrower defaults on debt that ranks at the same level or higher (or, to use CDS parlance, debt that is “not subordinated to the reference obligation”). If the AT1 bonds that were zeroed were deemed to rank pari passu with the £250mn subordinated bond that matured in 2020, that may be enough to trigger the swaps. On the surface, this does not appear to be the case. The form of legacy bank capital that Credit Suisse issued in the year 2000 was colloquially known as “lower tier 2”. In the order of priority that makes up a bank’s capital structure, it follows that “tier 1” ranks behind “tier 2”. And yet, in the 2020 maturity bond’s terms and conditions there is no reference to it being “tier 2” debt. The bond’s terms only set out that they are generic “subordinated obligations”. Unsurprisingly, there is no reference to the bond’s ranking in relation to AT1 debt, given that these securities did not yet exist when the bonds were issued in 2000. The hedge funds that are wagering on a payout are betting on the fact that, while market participants generally understand that the subordinated bond issued in 2000 ranked ahead of the AT1s, there is not anything making that explicit in the documents relevant to a CDS decision. In this logic, there is an amusing echo of the debate between Credit Suisse’s AT1 holders arguing that their debt was commonly understood to rank ahead of the bank’s common equity (which paradoxically was not zeroed in the merger and received $3bn) and sceptical observers telling them that this was never actually enshrined in the documents. The final piece of the puzzle is a New York court decision from 1918, which FT Alphaville understands has been submitted to the DC as part of a belt and braces approach to proving that perpetual bonds are still legally considered debt (the ruling deals with a “perpetual debenture” issued in 1901, a sort of early 20th century version of an AT1 bond). Senior moment Let’s imagine for the sake of argument that this gambit works. The DC agrees that there has indeed been a governmental intervention credit event in respect to Credit Suisse Group’s subordinated CDS. What then? CDS contracts do not all pay out the same amount when they are triggered. In most instances, an auction of the relevant bonds is held to determine what the loss to bondholders has been and to compensate them accordingly (for example, an auction that valued the bonds at 25 cents on the dollar would lead to a 75 cent payout on the CDS). Given that the subordinated bond Credit Suisse issued in 2000 has already been repaid and its other bonds that are eligible for a CDS auction were not impaired in the UBS merger, you might assume there is little reward in store for those betting on a surprise CDS default. This is where the hedge funds betting on a payout are banking on the sharp moves higher in interest rates over the past year coming to their aid, however. Credit Suisse Group has a bond outstanding that is trading at around 65 cents on the dollar, purely as a function of the dramatic change in underlying rates since it was issued at the end of 2021 (the bond in question has a skimpy 0.625 per cent coupon and a decade-long 2033 maturity, making it particularly sensitive to interest rate changes). While this is one of the so-called “HoldCo senior” bonds we discussed earlier, CDS contracts explicitly allow for bonds that are more senior than the reference obligation to be submitted into an auction. In the event that Credit Suisse’s subordinated CDS is deemed to have triggered, the hedge funds stand to bag a tidy 35 cent pay out. That’s nice in theory but… That’s the trade as FT Alphaville understands it. Essentially, these two funds think the ambiguity over the ranking of a dead bond is enough to turn the AT1 wipeout into a CDS payout. The big question remains: will it work?¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The logic behind it all may at times seem counterintuitive and faintly ridiculous, but then CDS decisions are frequently counterintuitive and faintly ridiculous. The members of the DC are not supposed to rule on how market participants intended the contracts to behave, but on their strict legal definitions, unintended quirks and all. The DC accepted the question late on Friday and will hold their first discussion on the matter later today, so the panel certainly thinks it is at the very least worthy of debate. It is also worth noting that there are serious players involved. FourSixThree and Diameter are both distressed debt specialists whose principals have extensive experience trading CDS. They have also enlisted a heavyweight law firm in Kramer Levin to support of their cause. One thing that does strike us, however, is that there are several steps that the DC needs to go along with for a payout to occur. This means the trade has multiple points of failure. For example, while the four corners of the 2000 vintage bond’s offering memorandum do not contain an indication that it is a Tier 2 bond that ranks ahead of the AT1, the order of hierarchy can be found in other publicly available documents. This document Credit Suisse issued in 2019 explicitly states that the 2000 bond has a “Tier 2” ranking, while also stating the AT1 bonds’ “position in subordination hierarchy in liquidation” is behind the Tier 2.  If the DC does not agree with the notion that the AT1 bonds are “not subordinate” to the “prior reference obligation”, then the whole trade falls apart. Athanassios Diplas, one of the architects of the modern CDS auction, has tweeted that this could be an “uphill battle”: A question has been submitted to the DC asking to confirm that the CS AT1 bonds were not subordinated to the RefOb of the CS CDS contracts. Don’t see how that would be possible given the nature of the AT1s.Feels like uphill battle.PS I cannot access some of their attached docs https://t.co/JbPW18HXrt— Athanassios Diplas (@AthanaDiplas) May 11, 2023

 Whatever the outcome though, one thing is for certain: the trade is delightfully weird and fun.  And FT Alphaville is strongly in favour of weird and fun trades, whether or not they are ultimately successful. Further reading:— Who killed Credit Suisse?

"US equities rise as ‘fear trades’ fade in broad-based rally","Wall Street joins global stock advance over waning concerns about banking turmoil","US stocks rose on Wednesday as waning fears of further turmoil in the banking sector whipped up investor appetite for finance and tech stocks.  Wall Street’s S&P 500 index added 1.4 per cent in a broad-based rally led by the real estate, tech and consumer discretionary sectors. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.8 per cent. Both indices are on track for modest monthly gains in March despite the recent collapses of three US banks. The KBW Bank index rose 2.1 per cent, while shares in First Republic Bank — a lender caught up in this month’s financial sector turbulence — climbed 5.6 per cent. “We’re seeing a marked decline in ‘fear trades’ across the spectrum,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay.   “Investors think policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have ringfenced banking systems against further turbulence.”  Bond markets fluctuated. The yield on the two-year US Treasury note was up 0.05 percentage points at 4.10 per cent, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 3.57 per cent. Yields fall when prices rise. The dollar advanced 0.3 per cent against a basket of six other currencies. Figures out on Wednesday showed US home sales rose for the third consecutive month in February, up 0.8 per cent compared with January. Economists polled by Refinitiv had expected a monthly decline of 2.3 per cent. In Asia, Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares rose more than 12 per cent, following similar gains on Wall Street the day before, while the Hang Seng Tech index, which tracks the largest technology companies listed in the city, climbed 2.4 per cent to its highest level since late February. China’s CSI 300 rose 0.2 per cent.   The moves came after Alibaba announced a radical restructuring plan on Tuesday that would split the company into six business groups. Long under pressure from domestic regulators, the company’s shares have fallen almost 70 per cent from their October 2020 peak. Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 index added 1.2 per cent, with shares in UBS up 3.7 per cent after the bank said it would bring back Sergio Ermotti as chief executive to steer its takeover of Credit Suisse. Europe’s Stoxx 600 Banks index gained 1.9 per cent.  London’s FTSE 100, meanwhile, rose 1 per cent, helped by real estate stocks after UK mortgage approvals edged up in February, rising to 43,500 from 39,600 in January. Prices for Brent crude gave up earlier gains to slip 0.5 per cent to $78.28 a barrel. US equivalent West Texas Intermediate fell 0.3 per cent to $72.97 a barrel. Gold, considered a haven asset, fell 0.5 per cent $1,963 an ounce.","29.03.2023"
"UK lenders report rise in household and company defaults","Bank of England’s quarterly survey points to squeeze on borrowers caused by increase in interest rates","A growing proportion of UK lenders are seeing a rise in defaults on their loans to households and companies, as rising interest rates continue to squeeze borrowers, official data showed on Thursday.  Responding to the Bank of England’s credit conditions survey, a net 14 per cent of banks and building societies said more households had defaulted on secured loans, such as mortgages, in the three months to the end of February compared with the previous quarter.  The net balance was well above the negative 1.4 per cent recorded in the previous three months to the end of November 2022, where the sub-zero value pointed to a decrease in the default rate.  Excluding a peak of 20.3 per cent in the first three months of 2021, when Covid-19 restrictions were still in place, the figure was the highest since the second quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis. It was also well above the minus 13 per cent average since 2010. “The uptick in defaults . . . underlines the daily struggle for many households to keep on top of rising prices,” said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at investment platform Interactive Investor. Many respondents to the survey, which ran between February 27 and March 17, said they expected default rates to rise further.  Although the poll’s reference period excludes the fallout from the collapse of the US’s Silicon Valley Bank and the forced takeover of UBS by Credit Suisse, lenders’ expectations for the next quarter might have been affected by the recent banking turmoil.  The sharp increase in default rates follows 11 consecutive interest rate rises by the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee, which are reflected in the rising level of loan repayments for households and businesses.  As part of efforts to bring down high inflation, the MPC last month lifted rates by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25 per cent, a 15-year high.   “Adding interest and repayments to the ever-growing mountain of monthly costs could prove to be one plate too many for a large number of Britons,” said Jobson. Thursday’s data also showed that lenders had made more mortgages available to households in the three months to the end of February, with the net balance soaring to 5 per cent from minus 34 per cent in the previous quarter. That is the first time this measure has been positive in more than a year.  Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at research group Capital Economics, said the “improvement in the availability of mortgage credit . . . appeared to reflect an end to the pull back in high loan-to-value lending” sparked by then chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini” Budget in September last year.  His announcement of £45bn of unfunded tax cuts sent gilt yields soaring, forcing many lenders to withdraw fixed-rate mortgage deals for new customers and reinstate them with higher rates. But lenders said they expected mortgage availability to fall back into negative territory in the three months to the end of May, “which may well reflect concerns stemming from the collapse of SVB and takeover of Credit Suisse”, said Wishart.","13.04.2023"
"Turkish default protection costs soar as Erdoğan leads presidential vote","Cost of credit default swaps records biggest rise in two years, while bonds sell off ","The cost of buying insurance against default on Turkish bonds has shot up to its highest level since November as investors brace themselves for further market stress on signs that incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appeared on course to clinch the country’s presidential election. The “spread” on five-year credit default swaps jumped more than 100 basis points to 607bp on Monday morning, the biggest single-day movement since March 2021. That means it would cost slightly more than $6mn a year to insure $100mn of debt against default for five years. But investors cautioned of bigger swings to come. “So far everyone is in wait-and-see mode, no one really knows how the market will react,” said Cagri Kutman, Turkish markets specialist at KNG Securities.   “If Erdoğan stays in power, most likely we will see CDS trade at 750bp or more” he added.  Leading up to the vote, Turkish markets had rallied as Erdoğan’s main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was ahead in the polls and had vowed to undertake sweeping reforms to lure back foreign capital.  But as Turkish markets opened on Monday Erdoğan was well ahead, and is now viewed as the clear favourite, with the two main candidates likely to be sent to a second round of voting on May 28.  Yields on Turkey’s benchmark 10-year dollar-denominated bonds, meanwhile, jumped to 9.25 per cent on Monday, a sharp 0.97 percentage point increase from Friday, to the highest level since March. Yields rise when prices fall.  Movements in the currency were more muted after Turkish state banks sold dollars to support it ahead of the election results. The lira was down 0.2 per cent against the dollar to TL19.66. Timothy Ash, of BlueBay Asset Management, a veteran Turkey watcher, said the government would fight to hold the lira steady until the second round but would struggle to do so for much longer.  “The battlefield will be the lira,” he said. If Erdoğan won the second round, he said, “we will be back to the perennial balance of payments crisis and we know the story there — Erdoğan doesn’t want to raise interest rates, Turkey has a big demand for dollars and they don’t have a lot of reserves”. Turkey’s large current account deficit and shortage of reserves leave importers struggling to obtain dollars. Citizens trying to buy foreign currency as protection against depreciation and inflation add to downward pressure on the lira.  Ash said that if Kılıçdaroğlu had won the presidency, the lira would still have fallen to about TL25 against the dollar owing to unmet demand. With an Erdoğan victory, he expected it to fall quickly to between TL25 and TL30 to the dollar after the second round. Assuming the government continues to prop up the lira post-election, the Central Bank of Turkey may be forced to raise rates in the second half of the year to avert a “major deposit dollarisation”, said analysts at UBS.  Turkey’s Bist 100 stock index — which ended 2022 at a record high but has since fallen 15 per cent — initially dropped 6.4 per cent before recovering to trade 3.1 per cent lower by midday local time. Financials were the worst-performing stocks, with the sector declining 8.3 per cent. Real estate and construction groups shot higher: Kiler Holding rose by a tenth while Pasifik GYO and Kizilbuk GYO added 9.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively.   Kutman said the recent rally in stocks, like demand for dollars, had been driven by local investors seeking protection against inflation and that this would limit the downside. Investors would now be looking for signs of a change in economic policy from the next Erdoğan administration but, as the president gave no indication of this during the election campaign, the likelihood of any shift towards economic orthodoxy was small. “Clearly the keyword now is uncertainty,” Kutman said. “There are big question marks over what may come next.”","15.05.2023"
"Boutique adviser Centerview beats Wall Street banks in deal rankings","Jump to third place ahead of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in closely watched standings","Centerview Partners has edged out Wall Street giants including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in deal activity rankings this quarter, taking the highest spot for a boutique advisory firm in decades. Centerview has rocketed up the closely scrutinised league tables to third place, based on the value of mergers and acquisitions so far this quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. That is up from 14th place in the same period last year, with the jump attributable to a combination of its work on large deals and expertise in bank rescue deals in the US and Europe.In total, Centerview advised on 18 deals totalling a value of nearly $94bn this year, the data shows, as it took market share amid a broader slowdown in dealmaking.  Centerview gained prominence this quarter as a go-to adviser for banks facing an emergency. After US regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank following a run on its deposits, Centerview was hired to manage a sale of assets including its investment bank. When UBS entered into negotiations for an emergency rescue of Credit Suisse, Centerview also played a key role advising Credit Suisse.  The complexity of the banking deals, in which many of the large Wall Street firms were already playing a role or were in some way conflicted, created an opening for smaller operators such as Centerview.   Centerview was also the lead adviser to oncology-focused biotech Seagen on its sale for $43bn to Pfizer, the largest deal of the quarter.* “Independents have always been the smarter option,” said Kenneth M Jacobs, chief executive of Lazard, referring to boutique investment banks. “The agility and the advice-focused model are what clients need in challenging times.” Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, who had both worked as investment bankers, started Centerview in 2006 at a fortuitous moment.  Just a few years later, the financial crisis eliminated several prominent full-service investment banks including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.  Some of the surviving firms were hobbled by heavy trading losses, fines and settlements worth billions of dollars, and distracted management.  A handful of independent boutiques, such as Lazard and Rothschild, are firms that were founded over a century ago. Others such as Evercore, Moelis & Co, PJT Partners, LionTree, Robey Warshaw and Zaoui & Co, were set up in recent decades. In a presentation shared ahead of its 2021 public listing, Perella Weinberg Partners told investors that the market share of independent firms in the M&A fee pool had jumped from 9 per cent in 2005 to 17 per cent in 2019.  *This article has been corrected to make clear that Centerview was the lead adviser to Seagen on its sale to Pfizer.

"Bid deadline for failed Silicon Valley Bank is extended as buyers hold back","FDIC says it will entertain separate offers for main lender and wealth unit","Federal regulators have extended the bidding period for Silicon Valley Bank, the California lender whose collapse earlier this month sparked a broader banking crisis, while also expanding the pool of institutions they are willing to accept as potential buyers of assets and deposits.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Monday it would accept separate bids for the main bank, now called Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, and for the private bank, which caters to wealthy customers and sits within its retail operations. It also said it was open to accepting bids from non-bank buyers for SVB’s assets.  The announcements mark a shift in the FDIC’s approach to selling the bank after taking it over on March 10 when customers panicking about its financial health raced to withdraw deposits.   With regional lenders reluctant to take on SVB’s assets, which largely include long-dated securities that have lost value after interest rate rises, the FDIC has failed to find a buyer for the bank as a whole.  The FDIC said bids for the private bank were now due by Wednesday while the bidding process for the main bank would close on Friday.  “There has been substantial interest from multiple parties, and the FDIC and the bidders need more time to explore all options in order to maximise value and achieve an optimal outcome,” the FDIC said in a statement.  The Financial Times previously reported that private equity firms, including Blackstone Group, Apollo Global Management and Carlyle Group, were looking at SVB’s $74bn loan book for assets that might fit into their credit portfolios.  Buyout groups wanted the option to study bids for large chunks of SVB’s loan book but were unable to conduct due diligence because the FDIC wanted to sell the bank in its entirety to a rival lender. Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here The FDIC closed SVB after a failed effort to raise new capital sparked a bank run, with customers withdrawing $42bn or a quarter of the bank’s total deposits.   US authorities have guaranteed all of SVB’s deposits and are operating the bridge bank to give customers access to their money.  The failure of SVB, which became the second-largest banking collapse in US history, has reverberated across the market. Billions of dollars have been wiped off bank valuations, and other regional lenders, including fellow California bank First Republic, are struggling to reassure investors about their financial positions.  On Sunday, Swiss lender UBS agreed to buy its rival Credit Suisse for $3.25bn after investors became concerned about its viability. ","20.03.2023"
"Central banks announce dollar liquidity measures to ease banking crisis","Turmoil prompts authorities to launch daily operations to access dollar funding via standing swap lines","The Federal Reserve and five other leading central banks have taken fresh measures to improve global access to dollar liquidity as financial markets reel from the turmoil hitting the banking sector. In a joint statement on Sunday, the central banks said that from Monday, they would switch from weekly to daily auctions of dollars in an effort to “ease strains in global funding markets”.  The daily swap lines between the Fed and the European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada and Bank of Japan would run at least until the end of April, the officials said.  The announcement of daily dollar auctions across time zones — a policy last put in place during the 2020 Covid-19 shock — came hours after the SNB announced that Switzerland’s two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, would merge after a frantic weekend of negotiations. European officials are concerned that the heavy losses imposed on Credit Suisse’s shareholders, and bondholders holding its additional tier one (AT1) debt, could increase stress in bank funding markets this week.  The Fed’s swap line network, first set up in 2007, has provided an important funding backstop for global banks during periods of acute market stress. Lenders outside the US can use the swap lines to access dollars in exchange for their domestic currencies by pledging collateral at their respective central banks. The ECB’s governing council held a call on Sunday evening to approve the switch to a daily swap line with the Fed.  “The network of swap lines among these central banks is a set of available standing facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses,” the central banks said. The BoE said it would announce details of each day’s operation at 8.15am London time. Operations would take place at 8.15am with a closing time for bids of 8.45am and the results announced at 10am or shortly afterwards. The funds would be offered at a rate equivalent to overnight US interest rates plus 25 basis points.   The Fed also has a facility in place that allows central banks and international monetary authorities to enter into repurchase agreements with the central bank and trade US Treasuries for dollars. The so-called Fima repo facility was first established as part of the Fed’s emergency measures to contain the fallout from the Covid crisis and was made permanent in 2021.

"Will US retail sales rebound as inflation cools?","Market Questions is the FT’s guide to the week ahead","Will retail sales advance after two months of declines?  US retail sales data for April, to be released on Tuesday, will offer insight into the sentiment among consumers as inflation cools. Economists polled by Reuters forecast that the Census Bureau will report a 0.7 per cent increase in overall retail sales from the previous month, following two months of declines. That will also reverse the drop of 0.6 per cent in March.  Analysts at Credit Suisse expect the increase to be driven by robust spending on cars and fuel. The underlying number, which strips out car-related spending, is expected to be weaker. The broker is forecasting a decline of 0.2 per cent in that metric month over month.   The outlook for retail sales is mixed as continued strength in the labour market and wages is likely to support consumer spending. However, it comes amid expectations of a recession, tightening financial conditions and slowing inflation, all of which tend to crimp spending.  The retail sales data comes after the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week reported that US inflation slowed its rise more than expected in April as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases continue to dent price rises. Smaller increases in prices typically slows the growth of retail spending. Kate Duguid How fast has Japan’s economy grown in the first quarter? Japan’s economy is under pressure from an unsteady post-Covid rebound in consumption, faltering real wages and weak demand for its exports. Real household spending unexpectedly fell 1.9 per cent year-on-year in March, denting the momentum of a recovery under way as the country threw off most of its coronavirus curbs and travel restrictions.  Real wages also notched up their 12th consecutive month of decline, with pay struggling to keep up with inflation, despite attention-grabbing increases from some of the country’s biggest brands. Goods exports, meanwhile, have suffered from weak global demand, particularly from China. UBS, the Swiss broker, has downgraded its forecast for growth from a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1 per cent, compared with the previous three month period, down from an earlier estimate of 2 per cent.   But it thinks there are reasons to believe economic growth will continue throughout the year. It points to pent-up demand created by the delayed pandemic reopening, the strong potential for inbound tourism and the likelihood of a rebound in real wages as lower import prices ease inflation. “Ahead, we think the economic recovery will continue even with the headwinds from a slower global economy,” it wrote. Analysts at Goldman Sachs agree, revising their GDP growth forecast down to 1.1 per cent from 1.7 per cent, based on a “mixed picture” presented by March economic data, but still predicting a “reactive upturn” from the final quarter of the year. William Langley Can the Mexican peso continue its run? The Mexican peso has emerged as the best performing leading emerging markets currency this year as high interest rates, an increase in remittances and its proximity to a strong US economy have made it a favourite among investors. The peso has risen by 10.8 per cent this year to trade at 17.6 to the dollar, its strongest level since 2017. But analysts warn that with a recession looming in the US, it could be close to its peak.  Oliver Harvey, managing director at Deutsche Bank, said the peso looks “among the most expensive” emerging market currencies and he would not expect it to outperform other currencies in the second half of the year, in the way it has done in recent months.  Caution comes as hedge funds have been ratcheting up their bets against Mexico, with $4.8bn government bonds on loan in May, up from a low of $2.7bn in February this year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.  The peso is one of the most sensitive of the emerging market currencies to a slowing of the US economy.  Brent David, senior portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay, said that a hard landing in the US, driven by debt ceiling concerns or tightening credit conditions, “would be extremely detrimental for the peso”.

"China’s largest auction houses plan to take on western rivals","Poly Auction and China Guardian hope to boost presence in lucrative market for international contemporary art","China’s biggest auction houses plan to increase travel and open offices overseas this year as they try to take on their larger western rivals in the lucrative market for international contemporary art. Poly Auction and China Guardian, two of the world’s largest auction houses by sales, told the Financial Times that the easing of pandemic travel restrictions would enable them to source more contemporary art, pieces of which regularly command the highest prices at auction and can rapidly surge in value. “We are not really afraid of other auction houses,” said Jenny Lok, head of business development at Poly Auction Hong Kong, a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned Poly Culture Group. “We are actually trying very hard to see if we can get more western contemporary artist consignors.”  Poly Auction hopes to expand its overseas presence with two new offices, one in London and one in South Korea this year, Lok said. The company is part of China Poly Group, which was founded as a spin-off of the People’s Liberation Army. She added that Poly had also promoted two new co-heads of contemporary art to help it expand from its traditional strongholds of Chinese ceramics and calligraphy and connect with more international collectors looking to sell their works at auction in China. The global push follows the company’s first independent contemporary art evening sales last year and collaborations with Phillips in 2020 and 2021, which Lok said had helped the group “expand our client pool” further into the realm of western art. Visitors attend a 2015 Poly Auction sale in Hong Kong. China’s share of the global contemporary art market fell to just 22% last year, its lowest level in more than a decade © Li Peng/Xinhua/Alamy  Together with its mainland sister companies, Poly Auction was China’s largest auction house in 2021, but its sales plummeted amid a countrywide slowdown to just under $450mn last year, less than a third of their original size, according to a joint report by art fair Art Basel and Swiss bank UBS. Sales at China Guardian dropped almost 40 per cent last year to $603mn, the report showed. China’s share of the global contemporary art market slipped to just 22 per cent last year, its lowest level in more than a decade as the pandemic hit spending habits and lockdowns impeded in-person attendance at sales, the report added. Postwar and contemporary art is the largest sector of the global art market, with $7.8bn worth of auction sales in 2022, or 54 per cent of the worldwide total. “I think there is a lot of pent-up demand,” said Clare McAndrew, author of the report and founder of Arts Economics. “When you look at the basic drivers in terms of wealth [in China] . . . they’re still going in the same direction.”  Poly’s efforts to sell more western works on the Chinese market, however, come as Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips, the world’s three major auction houses, have all announced plans to move into newer and larger Hong Kong offices as they hope to capitalise on the recovery. Phillips’s opened its 50,000-square-foot Asia headquarters in March in the city’s West Kowloon Cultural District, while Christie’s will move into a Zaha Hadid Architects-designed building in Hong Kong’s financial district in 2024. They will face increasing competition from Chinese counterparts when it comes to western art. “It has long been our ambition to do western art . . . But in these past three years of quarantine, we haven’t been able to travel,” said Hu Yanyan, president of China Guardian, adding that 2022 was the company’s “most difficult year”. Before the pandemic, an increasing number of western contemporary art collectors began considering using Chinese auction houses to sell their works, thanks to growing curiosity about Chinese buying power, Hu said. “So now, we hope we can re-establish that confidence, to tell them the Chinese market is still here.” Additional reporting by Gloria Li in Hong Kong","30.04.2023"
"Twenty S&P 500 stocks account for 90% of Wall Street’s gains this year","Banking sector turmoil has driven down interest rate expectations and boosted Big Tech stocks","Just 20 stocks account for almost 90 per cent of the US benchmark index’s $2.36tn gains so far this year, as instability in the banking sector has driven down interest rate expectations and boosted the attraction of Big Tech. Among the big gainers in the S&P 500, shares in chipmaker Nvidia have climbed by 83 per cent so far this year, while Facebook owner Meta is up 76 per cent and Salesforce has climbed 42 per cent, underlining the heavy concentration in the world’s most influential stock market. The market value of those and the other 17 best performing stocks have surged by $2.05tn in 2023. Apple’s valuation alone has shot up by almost $600bn, or 30 per cent, in the past three months.  The market capitalisation of the other stocks in the index — which is up almost 7 per cent so far in 2023 — has risen just $320bn over the same period, according to private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Ignoring gains for megacap growth stocks, the S&P 500 rose just 1.4 per cent in the first three months of 2023, said UBS.  “People are looking for safety and comfort given the cross-currents in the market, and tech gives them plenty of ease,” said JPMorgan sales trader Jack Atherton. Noting the well-worn phrase that “whenever the Fed hits the brakes, someone goes through the windshield”, he added that megacap tech appears to be “wearing an eight-point harness”. US technology companies in particular were left battered by rising borrowing costs in 2022, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbling a third from an all-time high as the present value of tech groups’ future cash flows declined.  The US Federal Reserve has continued to increase rates in 2023, but the fallout from the collapse of California-based Silicon Valley Bank in March is expected by some investors to tighten lending standards and cool economic activity to such an extent that further aggressive rate rises are no longer necessary.  Turmoil in the banking sector has lopped half a percentage point off the level at which investors expect rates to peak, with markets now split on whether the Fed will lift rates by 0.25 percentage points to a target range between 5 and 5.25 per cent or leave them unchanged when it next meets in early May. One month ago, before the failure of SVB, investors had expected rates to peak at about 5.5 per cent in September.  Technology stocks have been among the main beneficiaries of this recalibration. Many of those that suffered in 2022 but dominate US equity indices are now “exploding higher on the violent rates reset”, said Charlie McElligott, analyst at Nomura.  High inflation means the zero interest rate environment that spurred tech stocks to record highs in 2021 is unlikely to return any time soon, however, and the sector’s nascent rally may already be fading. Analysts at Bank of America have noted the first aggregate outflows from tech stocks in six weeks in the five days to March 31. ","08.04.2023"
"Banks and oil groups place bets on carbon capture schemes","Four companies including H&M and JPMorgan to spend a collective $100mn on carbon removal credits by 2030","Companies from banks and insurers to oil majors are placing bets on the development of a carbon capture industry and the resulting carbon removal credits used by buyers to compensate for their pollution that is expected to build into a lucrative market. Four companies including the retailer H&M and leading fossil fuel financier JPMorgan Chase in recent weeks have agreed to spend a collective $100mn on carbon removal credits by 2030. At the same time, another five companies including Swiss bank UBS and insurer SwissRe have agreed to buy almost 200,000 credits on delivery from 2025 via NextGen, a new Mitsubishi-backed group.   NextGen will source credits from carbon removal projects including a direct air capture (DAC) facility being developed by Occidental Petroleum’s subsidiary 1PointFive, at an average “target price” of $200 per credit. 1PointFive also secured a pre-purchase agreement last year with aerospace company Airbus for 400,000 credits linked to DAC.  Private equity firm Partners Group also announced in April that it would buy 7,000 credits generated by the start-up Climeworks’ direct air capture facilities, which suck carbon out of the atmosphere, over 13 years.  Climeworks, which sells small quantities of credits for about $1,000 each, and larger volumes for less, said it was expanding its US team to meet “increasing demand”. The EU-wide carbon price reached a high of €100 this year, as polluters bought up permits that allow them to emit a tonne of carbon. But long-term carbon credit deals, supported by new government subsidies in the US and elsewhere, meant carbon removal technologies were becoming more investment worthy, companies said.  While there had been previous carbon capture “hype cycles”, there was “a greater seriousness of purpose both on the corporate side and on the government side,” said David Reiner, from the Cambridge Judge Business School.  Climate CapitalWhere climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here. Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets here The $369bn US Inflation Reduction Act includes tax credits of $85 per tonne for facilities that capture and store carbon from pollution sources such as fossil fuel plants, and $180 per tonne for DAC plants that suck the gas out of the atmosphere.   A large scale DAC plant would cost between $125-$335 per tonne, according to the International Energy Agency. Carbon capture storage experts in the oil industry said the $85 tax credit had “closed the gap” on the investment case for simpler carbon capture projects. Nick Cooper, chief executive of carbon capture and storage developer Storegga, said the US taxpayer support had “a profound effect on the business environment. The CCS market has just taken off . . . This feels a bit like the US shale boom 15 years ago”. The US Environmental Protection Agency is facing a backlog of carbon capture permit applications. Although the oil and gas industry has long promoted carbon capture as a climate solution, there are no large scale operational plants and many past projects have failed. Critics argue the industry case for the capture of carbon enables oil and gas producers to continue to source fossil fuels for energy rather than switch to renewables. Much of the operational carbon capture is used for a controversial process known as enhanced oil recovery, in which carbon is pumped underground in order to extract more of the fossil fuel than would otherwise be possible.  Occidental plans to use carbon captured using DAC for enhanced oil recovery, and to sell the fuel branded as “net zero oil”. TotalEnergies, Shell and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, part of Occidental, are also among the companies pushing for the expansion of the market for carbon removal credits, via industry group the CCS+ Initiative.  Nevertheless, DAC was an early stage, expensive, energy intensive technology, so there were “reasons to be sceptical” about its commercial viability, said Reiner from the Cambridge Judge Business School. Carbons credits explainedCarbon credits, which are supposed to represent a tonne of carbon avoided or removed from the atmosphere, are not seen by many climate experts as a long-term solution to global warming. Buyers of credits, such as polluting steel, cement, airline and industrial companies, can use them to compensate for their emissions or trade them.As scrutiny about the quality of credits generated from tree planting and protection schemes has intensified, the developers of technological carbon removal projects have promoted credits from such schemes as more reliable.

"AT1vengers Assemble","Too bad they don’t have a time machine though","The banking equivalent of defenestration that befell Credit Suisse might have been sudden, but, the like the run-up, the aftermath is likely to be long, messy and litigious.  A press release from legal gunslingers Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan just landed in Alphaville’s inbox. It says the litigation firm is joining forces with a handful of other law firms representing aggrieved investors in various legal jurisdictions.  Here are the firms that will represent irate holders of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds, which were nuked by the Swiss authorities when they forced Credit Suisse into the arms of UBS:  United States — Wollmuth Maher & DeutschUnited Kingdom — Keidan HarrisonSingapore — Engelin TehGulf Cooperation Council — Global Advocacy and Legal CounselSwitzerland — Geissbühler Weber & Partners Quinn Emanuel had already filed a suit in St Gallen earlier this month. It now makes sense to corral most of the irate CS AT1 bondholders into one group, even if they might be different in type and potentially have differing legal avenues for redress.   For example, some are based in countries that have signed a variety of investment treaties with Switzerland that offer at least plausible protection from expropriation. The lack of any continental European representation in the list above might indicate that this group has concluded they don’t have any real avenues for redress? Or perhaps they’re all in the UK one.  Anyway, in the statement Dennis Hranitzky, the head of Quinn Emanuel’s sovereign litigation practice, made a big deal out of the joining of forces of institutional and retail investors: The unlawful action of FINMA has had devastating consequences on thousands of retail and small investors globally. While the headlines to date have focused on larger institutional holders, it is important to recognize the impact this has had on the savings of many individual investors who have been unlawfully deprived of their property rights and also deserve justice. Through this initiative, working with these partner firms, we can extend the reach of the bondholder group to the hundreds of retail investors who have reached out to us since the AT1 wipeout was announced. OH NO WILL NO ONE THINK OF THE POOR ORDINARY RETAIL INVESTORS WHO INVESTED IN HIGH-YIELDING PERPETUAL SECURITIES EXPLICITLY CALLED ‘WRITE-DOWN CAPITAL NOTES’ AND ISSUED BY A BANK WITH MORE LEGAL TROUBLE THAN THE AVERAGE MAFIA FAMILY? So how likely are they to win? Former Alphavillain and current FT Switzerland correspondent Sam Jones has gone through the subtle shift in legal tactics from the initial public protestations of bondholders here. Basically: The law firm has advised bondholders that trying to challenge the constitutional right of the Swiss government to evoke emergency powers, in what was a potentially economically explosive situation, is an unwise legal strategy. Instead the case hinges on constitutionally-enshrined protections for due process, arguing that Finma’s right to act was conflated by its officials with its necessity to act. The complaint argues that Finma was obliged under Articles 5 and 9 of the Swiss constitution to arrive at a decision “in good faith and in a non-arbitrary manner” and did not do so. It also argues that Article 36, paragraph 3 was violated, which stipulates that “any restrictions on fundamental rights must be proportionate”. The right to property is a fundamental right in Swiss law. The fact that shareholders were compensated, but bondholders were not, demonstrates that consideration was not given to proportionality, Quinn Emanuel will argue. It will certainly be an interesting case to follow, but FTAV remembers the post-Greek debt restructuring aftermath well. And as we wrote last month, when it comes to local-law issued bonds, history shows that governments can pretty much do what they please.  In other words, all creditors are subordinated to political expediency. At some point perhaps the Swiss government’s political calculus might change, and AT1 bondholders might be able to get something. But this is unlikely to become another pari passu saga.

"Bank of Japan drops part of forward guidance on rates and starts policy review","Yen weakens to lowest point in six weeks after new governor Kazuo Ueda’s first meeting","The Bank of Japan has scrapped a key part of its forward guidance on interest rates in Kazuo Ueda’s first board meeting as governor, signalling the first step towards unwinding its ultra-loose monetary policy. The yen fell sharply on Friday as the 71-year-old economist played it safe during his debut, announcing a comprehensive review of the BoJ’s policies while holding off from revising its longstanding yield curve control measures. Ueda became the first academic to take the helm of Japan’s central bank this year, with the job of laying the groundwork for interest rate normalisation as consumer prices in the country hit a multi-decade high.  He left room for policy changes in the coming months, with the BoJ forecasting inflation was likely to remain close to its 2 per cent target in the next two fiscal years. “Compared to before, we’re now able to have some hope that the 2 per cent inflation target can be sustainably reached,” Ueda said at a news conference on Friday. But he added that the risk of premature tightening was currently higher than the risk of inflation getting out of control: “We want to patiently and persistently continue with monetary easing for a short while longer.”  The yen weakened to its lowest point in six weeks, falling as much as 1.1 per cent to ¥135.45 per dollar on Friday, as investors bet on a continued dovish stance under Ueda. The Topix stock index rose 1.2 per cent. The BoJ held overnight interest rates at minus 0.1 per cent and maintained its yield curve control policy, saying it would continue to allow 10-year government bond yields to fluctuate by 0.5 percentage points above or below its target of zero. Following in the footsteps of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, the BoJ dropped a part of its forward guidance that previously said it “expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels”.  The removal of this clause, which was originally aimed at supporting the economy after Covid-19, could make it easier for the BoJ to scrap yield curve control. “The removal of forward guidance . . . points to the possibility that a change in the Bank’s yield curve control policy could actually come far more quickly in coming months,” Benjamin Shatil, a foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan. In its economic outlook report, also released on Friday, the BoJ stuck to its forecast that core consumer prices, excluding fresh food, would fall below its 2 per cent target this year after the index rose at a rate of 3.1 per cent in March from a year earlier. But the bank said it expected price rises of 2 per cent in the 2024 fiscal year, instead of its previous forecast of 1.8 per cent. It also expects 1.6 per cent inflation in the 2025 fiscal year. Stripping out fresh food and energy prices, the BoJ said it forecast consumer prices to rise 1.8 per cent in the year through March 2026. According to UBS chief Japan economist Masamichi Adachi, the latest inflation forecast allows the BoJ to buy time and flexibility in its policy direction.  “The message the BoJ is trying to send is that the inflation trend is rising and preparations for policy change are under way,” Adachi said, adding that the broader policy review, which will take place over 18 months, would not stop the BoJ making near-term changes to easing measures.

"China’s biggest IPO in years poses $9bn question for western banks","Goldman Sachs and others seek clarity over planned Shanghai listing of agricultural chemicals group Syngenta","Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and other western banks have spent months lobbying to work on one of China’s biggest-ever stock market listings. Syngenta’s planned $9bn Shanghai offering seems like a dream ticket for the banks: a large international company that has existing relationships with global institutions. But as rising geopolitical tension unravels the commercial ties between the US and China, the banks may not even be able to participate, reflecting the rapidly changing business landscape in the world’s second-largest economy.  “We do want to be a part” of the Swiss agricultural chemicals company’s initial public offering, said one Asia-based banker at a global group. But “we always have the question mark — are we able to eventually work on this or not?”  Syngenta’s owner for the past six years, state-owned ChemChina, is on a US government watchlist of companies with close ties to China’s military. Global banks are asking lawyers and political consultants if they can or should be part of the listing, yet most have no clear answer.  The Syngenta listing “is the embodiment of how difficult it is from a financial services standpoint to succeed in China”, said Han Lin, China country head at advisory firm The Asia Group. “If you can’t even do [the IPO of] an established international firm with a long history, what hope is there of participating in local deals?” A greenhouse at a Syngenta biotech centre in Beijing © Reuters This year, foreign banks have been involved in just $297mn worth of new listings in China, or 1.2 per cent of the total — putting them on track for the smallest share of the annual total since they began operating in the country’s securities sector in 2009, according to data from Dealogic. The freeze-out has been especially harsh for US banks, which have failed to nab spots on a single mainland Chinese IPO in 2023, despite a total of $26bn being raised this year.  If successful, the Syngenta public offering will be the fourth-biggest listing in mainland China.   It has taken years to materialise. ChemChina, which pulled off the largest-ever outbound takeover by a Chinese company when it purchased Syngenta in 2017, tried to list it earlier but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.  This year, Syngenta dropped plans to list on Shanghai’s tech-focused Star board after the exchange rejected it without explanation.  The company finally got the green light from a Shanghai Stock Exchange listing committee this month to list 20 per cent of the company on the exchange’s main board. If Syngenta achieves its goal of raising Rmb65bn ($9.1bn), it would rank as one of the largest listings in China’s history, according to Dealogic data.  Bankers at Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and HSBC — all of which have mainland investment banking businesses — have been lobbying for roles on the listing, for which a roadshow could begin within weeks, said multiple people with knowledge of the process. “Even given the US-China relationship, we continue to stick to our strategy” of bringing international investors to China, said an executive at one of the banks. Western banks are particularly drawn to the listing because it would position them well to win more business if the company carried out a secondary listing in London, Zurich or New York — an option that people close to the company have said is still on the table.  The global banks’ main selling point is their ability to bring in international investors, such as hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds. “It’s a Swiss company,” said a banker with knowledge of the process. “If you’re a Chinese investor, you’d want to see foreigners investing. It would give you more comfort.” As recently as October, banks including Citi, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and HSBC advised the Swiss group on a $500mn bond issuance in Hong Kong. However, the Syngenta IPO prospectus is available only in Mandarin, and no western banks have been publicly appointed even to junior roles. Syngenta and the banks declined to comment.  In 2021, when Covid-19 restrictions prevented senior western bankers from travelling to the mainland to make pitches in person, Syngenta appointed China International Capital Corporation, Bank of China International and Citic Securities as the main underwriters and lead distributors. One issue for western banks is over potential complications from widening US sanctions.  In 2022, ChemChina was placed on the US Department of Defense’s “Chinese military companies” list. The department said the US “reserves the right to take additional actions” against companies on the list, as part of its effort to combat China’s “military-civil fusion strategy”. Banks are not legally prevented from advising Syngenta on that basis, said Benjamin Kostrzewa, former assistant general counsel at the Office of the US Trade Representative and a lawyer at Hogan Lovells in Hong Kong. “But it could create some scrutiny from policymakers in Washington who are anxious to prevent US companies from supporting companies associated with the Chinese military.” It is not clear whether western banks — especially US ones — will be able to get far enough into the process to have to worry about such questions. Executives from two US groups said they would make final decisions about whether they could act on the deal if they actually win mandates from the company to do so. In the meantime, their Asia-based bankers are stuck in limbo. “Do we pitch it 100 per cent all in, or to 80 per cent of [our ability]?” said one of the bankers. “You probably wouldn’t be all in.” Additional reporting by Arjun Neil Alim in London This article has been updated to clarify that ChemChina is on a US Department of Defense list. An earlier version said it was on an Office of Foreign Assets Control list, from which it was removed in 2021","26.06.2023"
"Goldman to fund meagre payouts to banks hammered by Archegos collapse  ","Lenders that lost billions will get back as little as 5 cents on the dollar from restructuring ","Banks that lost billions from the meltdown of Archegos Capital Management will get back as little as 5 cents on the dollar from its restructuring, with brokers such as Goldman Sachs funding the payouts using cash left in the family office’s trading accounts. Global banks, including Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, that lost more than $10bn from the blow-up of Archegos, are expecting to recoup between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of their losses, according to people familiar with the matter.  Credit Suisse, the biggest casualty of the collapse, which left it facing more than $5bn of losses, could get back as little as $250mn.   The banks and restructuring advisers managing the unravelling of Archegos are nearing the end of a “workout” negotiation to agree how assets that belong to the family office will be distributed to the banks with claims against it, the people said. It comes nearly two years after the investment firm run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang spectacularly imploded. The fund had made tens of billions of dollars of bets on US and Chinese stocks by borrowing heavily from banks’ prime brokerage divisions, which had to be rapidly unwound when the value of the companies slumped and Archegos could not meet margin calls. As Archegos’s positions collapsed, some of the banks acting as prime brokers liquidated collateral more quickly than others in order to avoid losses on their loans, and in some cases even left cash in the investment firm’s accounts. The funds to repay creditors are largely coming from the banks such as Goldman Sachs that offloaded collateral and covered their loans.  Some of the cash left in those accounts is being returned to Archegos and will be distributed by its restructuring advisers to the banks that lost money, the people said. A pot of money has also been set aside for Archegos employees who were owed money by the firm as part of a deferred bonus scheme.  Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo were also able to unwind their trades without incurring losses, people familiar with the matter said. Deutsche handed back about €20mn to Archegos after it sold out of its positions, said a person close to the bank. These banks “did a better job of covering themselves than the others, had more restrictive lending or just got lucky”, said one person close to the matter. It meant they ended up with their Archegos trading accounts in the black when they terminated its swaps contracts, they added. The meltdown of Archegos has led to market manipulation and fraud charges in the US for Hwang and three others who worked at Archegos.  It has also led to regulatory scrutiny on three continents and a reckoning at the banks that provided services to the firm.  Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, UBS, MUFG and Mizuho were all exposed through their prime brokerage or trading divisions and lost $10bn when they liquidated their positions. The banks have spent nearly a year in negotiations with Archegos as it attempts to realise and restructure its assets and liabilities. They are not expected to bring legal claims against the company as part of the restructuring effort in order to avoid a long and public court process and because the assets it can realise to repay them are so small, said one of the people.  Credit Suisse, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Wells Fargo, Nomura and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Receiving any proceeds from the Archegos restructuring would be a boon for Credit Suisse, given the bank is in the middle of a costly restructuring and was forced to seek SFr4bn, or just over $4bn, from investors to pay for it. “Frankly, anything above 1 per cent back would be amazing,” said one Credit Suisse executive. A year ago, the bank said it had partially reduced its provisions on the loss by roughly $185mn “in respect of claims against Archegos”. Credit Suisse made just $17mn in revenue from Archegos in the year running up to its collapse, the Financial Times has reported. Additional reporting by Stephen Morris and Eric Platt","01.02.2023"
"Why fair pay matters more than high pay ","Also in today’s newsletter, the workplace buzzwords to take seriously ","This article is an on-site version of our Working It newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday Why are many leaders so bad at identifying potential crises before they hit? And what lessons can we all learn from those who are good risk planners?  In the wake of the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse’s takeover by UBS, we tackle crisis planning on the Working It podcast this week. My guests are the FT’s Michael Skapinker and John Mullins, an entrepreneur and professor of management practice at London Business School. As Skapinker says, our human tendency towards “groupthink” is part of what prevents leaders from hearing dissenting voices, and that impedes effective crisis planning. “You need to have an institutional way of ensuring that you hear the alternative view.” After the recording, I asked Skapinker for his tips on what the rest of us can learn from the founders and CEOs who do plan effectively for the worst: “An organisation should commission people to draw up a Plan B, so that it can be compared with the proposed course of action. We can do that in our own lives and careers too. One of the commenters under my FT article [on preparing for crises] talked about doing a ‘pre-mortem’ — saying to ourselves ‘let’s imagine that what we intend to do has gone wrong. Why did it go wrong?’ It may still go wrong, but there’s a better chance that it won’t.”   This is the last Working It newsletter for a few weeks — I am taking some time off to write a book (yes, about the workplace).

(Isabel Berwick)  Top stories from the world of work: The workplace buzzwords to take seriously — and those to ignore: Pilita Clark delves into the Great Resignation, quiet quitting and other workplace trends. TL;DR? It pays to treat your workers well.The London office market lags its pre-Covid levels. Attendance in London offices is still among the lowest in Europe as staff have embraced hybrid work.

Here’s how they did it.Boomerang CEOs provide comfort in times of trouble. From Bob Iger at Disney to Sergio Ermotti at UBS, the bringing back a former boss has become a familiar phenomenon in recent months. We unpick whether it actually works. There are disguised blessings in Japan’s demographic decline. The trend has given young workers far more flexibility. The scarcity of candidates allows workers to “walk away from anything they do not like — bullying, excessive overtime, sexism — and into something they might,” writes Leo Lewis.  Why fair pay is more important to staff than high pay  A demonstrator calls for fair pay at a protest called by the British trade union Public and Commercial Services Union © AFP via Getty Images Getting “employee experience” right has become a huge challenge for employers, as they seek to retain staff — and keep workers engaged, and productive. It’s a term that used to be confined to HR departments but has become far more widespread since the start of the pandemic; it provides a neat way of describing all the interactions a staff member has with their employer throughout their career.  Like a lot of the shifts in workplaces since the start of the pandemic, the rise of “employee experience” as a preoccupation focuses on the human side of work. That’s evidenced in Deloitte’s latest human capital trends report, based on a survey of 10,000 business and HR leaders worldwide. It suggests that the changing world of work means that organisations and workers should be “approaching strategies from a human lens — for humans and by humans”.  This is interesting but high level. What does a “human focus” on employee experience actually mean in practice — and what do staff want from their employer? Josh Bersin, who heads an eponymous US human capital consultancy, says that “every major study of employee experience from Gallup to our own studies finds that ‘trust in the organisation’ and ‘trust in management’ and ‘trust in peers’ is the number one driver of satisfaction.”  Bersin conducted a survey of employee experience at 448 companies and found that “trust is degraded when people perceive unfair pay”. And while 71 per cent of executives think pay equity is important, only 14 per cent have any allocated budget to address the issue.   Pay equity is not something that has, until now, been high on many agendas. Bersin defines it as “every employee [being] rewarded in a way that represents their performance against goals, company strategy and overall contribution to the company’s success”.  People who think they are paid unfairly compared to their peers are likely to be less engaged and much more likely to leave their employer. A robust pay equity policy was considered far more important by employees in Bersin’s survey than having high levels of pay and benefits across the company. The point for leaders and HR departments to take on board is that basic human desire for fairness is at the heart of this issue — and it goes beyond how much people are paid compared to colleagues. As Bersin found, “if pay is unfair, then usually growth, development and other benefits are unfair.” Leaders need to make changes, Bersin says. “That means the CEO has to believe we are not going to ‘overpay’ the favourites, the highly skilled or the ‘hard-to-find’ people without looking at a model and set of decisions on what high performance means.”  What can be done to make pay fairer at all levels? It’s hard, since people come in at different salary points, or are switching industries, or have been underpaid because of bias among previous managers’ evaluations. As a first step, there are “pay equity” software programmes (including tools like Syndio and Salary.com) that will evaluate all salaries in an organisation and look for statistical factors that might be causing pay differentials.  After that, managers need to keep momentum going by building in regular reviews and having a clear idea of what does — and does not — constitute good performance. (Isabel Berwick) A word from the Working It community Last week, author Margaret Heffernan wrote about the fact that succession planning and the prospect of retirement are unavoidably emotional for any CEO— but there are ways to make the process less frightening. Our readers weighed in with their own suggestions.  Autopundit1 spoke of the importance of independence nominating committees:  Good corporate governance structures can mitigate this problem substantially. Specifically, board nomination committees — chaired by one of the independent directors and with no participation by the CEO, of course, should be mandated to review the boss’ tenure on a rolling basis. Granzyme B suggests what’s really at the root of executives who are reluctant to leave: If the passion is for doing something that might or can make a difference to society including providing job opportunities, it invariably becomes a huge part of an individual’s persona. The problem is the ego. Second life student draws a comparison to the process members of the military go through when they leave service:  They talk about this when people leave the Armed Forces — the loss of status. It’s an adjustment, and the higher they are, the harder it is. Somewhat sweetened by a final payment, and a nice pension though.

"Asset Management: Cracks in European commercial real estate","Plus, BlackRock on the hunt for deals, Silicon Valley investors on tour and WisdomTree’s shareholder revolt","Hello, I’m Emma Dunkley on the Asset Management team and I’m filling in for Harriet today.  One scoop to start: Hedge funds and other parts of the shadow banking system should face greater scrutiny after last month’s sharp move in US Treasuries, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The chair of the US’s top markets regulator, Gary Gensler, told the Financial Times that taming risks from speculative funds was now “more important than ever”. Read more here.

Sign up here to get it sent straight to your inbox every Monday. Does the format, content and tone work for you? Let me know: harriet.agnew@ft.com  Cracks in European commercial real estate Rising interest rates and the recent banking crisis are shaking the foundations of commercial real estate, with significant ramifications for asset managers.   Offices were already having a tough time: the shift to hybrid working during the pandemic led many companies to shrink their real estate portfolio while tenants downsized and vacated their premises.  But commercial property owners are now having to battle a sharp increase in borrowing costs as central banks raise rates to combat inflation. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse sent shockwaves through the banking sector and has stoked fears that credit will become less available and more expensive. As my colleague Joshua Oliver reports, Europe’s commercial property sector is showing signs of strain, just as property prices are slumping. Analysts at Citi have warned that European real estate values could fall by up to 40 per cent by the end of 2024. European commercial property prices fall Capital value growth, rebased (100 = Dec 2007) © MSCI Real Capital Analytics • includes UK Pressure on commercial real estate has repercussions for the asset management sector. A number of funds have over the past year been forced to delay withdrawal requests from institutions in order to offload the underlying assets in a timely manner. While many continue to defer redemption orders, BlackRock has started to repay some investors who attempted to redeem their investment as far back as a year ago.  Regulators are keeping a close eye on the sector, especially the liquidity mismatch between open-ended funds that offer investors instant access to their money and property assets, which take time to sell. Earlier this month, the European Central Bank called for a crackdown on commercial property funds to prevent a liquidity crunch if more investors head for the exit. Even though offices — the largest part of the commercial property industry — are still struggling, some companies are keen to see more staff back in the workplace. Last week, JPMorgan Chase called on its managing directors to return to the office five days a week, warning other employees not to fall short of their “in-office attendance expectations”.   Still, these buildings could become a burden for banks and investors, against a backdrop of rising costs and broader changes across the workplace.  Fink on the prowl for deals BlackRock’s chair and chief executive Larry Fink is ready to pounce on deal opportunities.  Even though the world’s largest asset manager has not been immune to the difficult market environment of late, Fink reckons the recent banking crisis could pave the way for an acquisition.  “If there is an opportunity to do something transformational, we are going to be prepared to do it,” Fink told analysts on Friday. “How can we double down on what we’re doing with . . . technology? How can we build out our footprint globally at this time?” The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month triggered concerns in the US about regional lenders and potential losses in their loan books. Soon after, Credit Suisse was rescued by rival Swiss bank UBS.  BlackRock looked at buying part of Credit Suisse before the UBS deal was struck. Fink said “to be in the game, we must play the game. And so we’re in the game.”  His comments come as BlackRock reported a surge in assets under management to $9.1tn, up $500bn on the previous quarter and higher than analysts had expected. The increase was fuelled by the market’s slight recovery in the wake of last year’s turbulence, although BlackRock also reported $110bn of inflows from customers. However, BlackRock’s net income still took a hit in the first quarter, dropping by a fifth year-on-year to $1.1bn. Revenue was also down by a tenth to $4.2bn, partly dragged down by a 40 per cent fall in performance fees relating to its hedge funds and alternative products.  The money manager faces other headwinds. Republican state treasurers have withdrawn more than $4bn of government pension and treasury funds from the company on the grounds that it “boycotts” fossil fuel. BlackRock denied those claims and noted that it invests money the way its clients want. Chart of the week  France’s stock market has surged to a series of record highs as investors pile into luxury goods groups on hopes of a sustained rebound in Chinese demand for high-end brands. The Cac 40 has risen 16 per cent so far this year and by more than 30 per cent since a low at the end of September, outperforming Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 and the US S&P 500 over the same period.  Shares in Cac-listed cyclical stocks including chipmaker STMicroelectronics, carmaker Stellantis and oil and gas group TotalEnergies have all climbed sharply in recent months.  Yet roughly one-third of the market’s rally since the start of the fourth quarter last year stems from burgeoning investor interest in Hermès, Kering, LVMH and L’Oréal.  Shares in the four companies have risen 61 per cent, 25 per cent, 45 per cent and 28 per cent respectively since then, with LVMH and Hermès hitting record highs. Beijing’s abrupt dismantling of its zero-Covid restrictions late last year accounts for much of the wider luxury goods sector’s recent success, according to analysts.  China is “the most important market” for European luxury names, according to Morgan Stanley, with about two-thirds of Chinese consumers’ personal spending on expensive accessories taking place abroad before the pandemic began. Prices for luxury goods can be up to 30 per cent lower in Europe than in China, the bank said.  “Luxury stocks tick many boxes at the moment”, said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. “Some global investors likely find indirect exposure to China via European stocks, and luxury in particular, easier, more liquid and less risky than direct investment in Chinese shares”.  Five unmissable stories this week Inside the financial engineering that allowed the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partners TDR Capital to stump up just £200mn for their 2020 deal to buy Asda, the UK supermarket chain valued at £6.8bn — the UK’s biggest leveraged buyout in a decade.

"Deutsche Bank says it was hit by a ‘speculative attack’ during turmoil ","German lender’s clients pulled more than €7bn in late March after sharp drop in share price ","Deutsche Bank has said a “speculative attack” that sent its share price tumbling last month prompted customers to pull money from Germany’s largest lender, underlining the depth of the turmoil that swept the sector. James von Moltke, the bank’s chief financial officer, on Thursday said the bank had been a victim of an attack that triggered “sentiment-driven outflows” in the days after Swiss regulators engineered the sale of Credit Suisse to UBS on March 19. On March 24, and with markets still febrile, the cost of insuring Deutsche Bank’s debt against default surged to a four-year high, prompting an almost 20 per cent fall in its share price in a matter of hours.  Regulators have since reportedly established that the wild swings were caused by a single bet on the bank’s credit default swaps, the instruments investors and traders use to guard against companies defaulting. “We were subject to a speculative attack and naturally that caught the attention of our clients,” von Moltke said. “We were obviously heavily in contact with our counter parties . . . What was very gratifying is, except for a very small number, there was no real need for conversations. People knew where we stood as a bank.”  Deutsche Bank’s disclosure underlines how fragile markets became last month following the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the forced rescue of Credit Suisse. The outflows in late March had “no significant impact” on Deutsche Bank’s deposit base, which chief executive Christian Sewing described on Thursday as “absolutely super stable”. Clients at the bank’s wealth management division yanked more than €7bn in the last days of March. Overall, the bank’s deposits shrank by €29bn in the quarter to €592bn. Von Moltke said the bulk of the €29bn in outflows was linked to clients moving deposits into higher-yielding products such as money market funds and happened before the turmoil of the final week of March. The outflows quickly stopped as the turmoil eased, von Moltke said, adding that deposit flows were “stable to up” in April.  The speed at which a spike in Deutsche Bank’s CDS hammered its share price — and ultimately alarmed customers — has prompted concern among regulators. Andrea Enria, the chair of the European Central Bank’s supervisory board, has called for a review of the “opaque” trading in the CDS market. The chaos on March 24 forced Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz to publicly dismiss any comparisons between the lender and Credit Suisse. Sewing on Thursday described Deutsche Bank’s funding base as “so diversified that it makes a big difference to other banks”, pointing to the fact that 73 per cent of the deposits are in its domestic market, mainly from the retail and corporate clients.  Despite March’s turmoil, Deutsche Bank on Thursday said its profits hit a decade high in the first quarter. Pre-tax earnings climbed 12 per cent to €1.9bn from a year earlier, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of €1.7bn.  Anke Reingen, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said the better than expected results were “reassuring”.  The bank said it was accelerating its cost-cutting and raised its savings target by 25 per cent to €2.5bn. About 800 senior jobs in back-office roles will be axed “immediately” this year, with the new restructuring leading to €500mn in one-off costs in 2023.   Deutsche Bank announced its quarterly results hours after the bank unveiled a management shake-up that includes Christiana Riley, who led the bank’s US operations, joining Santander. As part of the changes, chief administrative officer Stefan Simon will take on Riley’s responsibilities. Claudio de Sanctis, the head of wealth management, will succeed Karl von Rohr, who will leave in October when his contract expires.","27.04.2023"
"ETF investors snap up tech, gold and Japan","Nervousness remains about US stocks despite bull market rally ","Latest news on ETFsVisit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings Wall Street stocks may now technically be in a bull market, but exchange traded fund investors appear to be largely resisting the siren call to jump on board the rally. Net inflows to US equity ETFs did tick up to $22.1bn in May, their highest level this year, according to data from BlackRock. However — technology stocks aside — there seemed to be greater enthusiasm for more idiosyncratic assets such as Japanese equities and gold. “The overarching theme is that flows did pick up in US equity, but still nowhere near the peak of flows we have seen in the past,” said Karim Chedid, head of investment strategy for BlackRock’s iShares arm in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The relatively lacklustre buying is suggestive of unusually muted enthusiasm for US stocks, even though the S&P 500 is up more than 20 per cent from its October low. The breaching of the bull market barrier was greeted by analysts at Morgan Stanley with a warning that they “still expect a meaningful earnings recession this year [a 16 per cent year-on-year decline] that has yet to be priced in”. Meanwhile, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, recommended “investors continue to exercise caution” as “it’s impossible to know whether the bear market trough — the ultimate low of the market cycle — is behind us”. “If the economy were to contract later this year, as we still think it will, times might get a lot tougher for equities,” said Thomas Mathews, senior market economist at Capital Economics. Scott Chronert, global head of ETF research at Citigroup, said inflows into technology-focused ETFs “tell an AI story”, as investors bet that rapid developments in artificial intelligence will benefit the bottom lines of a handful of tech stocks, while outflows from economically sensitive sector ETFs point to “ongoing recession concerns”. Chedid noted that a notional “S&P 492” — the flagship index robbed of its eight largest constituents — is actually down a fraction this year. Against this backdrop, ETF investors “have been buying the concentrated part of the market through tech exposures”. Tech ETFs globally took in a net $15.9bn in May, BlackRock’s figures show. Chedid cautioned that this figure had been artificially inflated by $5.5bn due to technicalities related to the reclassification of some tech stocks as financial companies.  Nevertheless, even $10.4bn, driven by six straight weeks of inflows, is still enough to make tech comfortably the most popular sector year to date.  “There is a sentiment story about tech. It makes sense why it happened because we have had the AI rally,” said Chedid, adding that although positioning in the futures market in broad US equities “doesn’t look crowded, it does in the [tech heavy] Nasdaq”. Some of those unenthused about the US stock market are instead looking at Japanese equities. US and European ETFs focused on Tokyo stocks attracted a net $1.9bn in May, the second $1bn+ month in a row and the strongest buying since 2020.  “Funds providing exposure to Japanese equities have been popular as US investors sought out the high dividend yields offered in the developed international markets,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy. His data showed that the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) pulled in a net $715mn in May, while the currency hedged WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (DXJ) attracted $240mn. “Overseas buying is picking up from nowhere,” said Chedid, something he attributed in part to an “acceleration” in Japan’s corporate reform agenda that has ushered in “significant improvements in shareholder responsible behaviour”. In addition, he also cited an “interesting” macroeconomic environment in Japan, with growth firming even as it falters elsewhere due to the country’s late emergence from Covid lockdowns.  “They reopened much later which means they are still experiencing a reopening trend, so growth is still picking up”, Chedid said. “They are also seeing inflation pick up. [That combination] is usually good for markets and it’s out of cycle with the rest of the world.” He forecast that foreign buying of Japan “has further to go”, given that ownership is still limited. “Based on [BlackRock’s] analysis of expected performance for Japan, an optimised [global] equity portfolio would have a 10.2 per cent allocation to Japan, but this currently sits at 4.8 per cent,” Chedid said.  Gold ETFs also shone, with May flows of $1.9bn taking the tally since March to $4.3bn, following a long period where they were out of favour, with net outflows of $27.2bn between April 2022 and the turning point in March. Rosenbluth said gold ETFs were a “safe haven for investors during the US debt ceiling crisis”, with SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) adding $875mn and the cheaper SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) $205mn. The resolution of that crisis might erase a source of support for the metal, but Chedid believed there were still “buyers out there” despite gold trading near all-time highs. “Real rates have stabilised and physical demand has returned, when it was pretty lacklustre for four years because of lockdowns in India and China, the two largest markets. And central banks are buying gold,” he said.

"Falling inflation and smaller rate rises in US give hope to emerging markets","Analysts caution however that developing countries would not automatically be able to start cutting interest rates ","Falling inflation and smaller interest rate rises in the US and other advanced economies hold out the hope of a rebound for emerging markets, according to analysts.  Developing countries have suffered this year under a toxic combination of rising interest rates, a strong US dollar, soaring food and fuel prices and other disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As some of those conditions start to ease, the prospects for economic growth should improve, analysts say. Wednesday’s decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise its policy rate by 0.5 percentage points after four straight rises of 0.75 ppts will be welcomed by many policymakers as the start of that process.  But Manik Narain, emerging market strategist at Swiss bank UBS, said it was too early to assume that easing by the Fed would automatically open the door to cuts in developing countries. This is because inflation has become deeply entrenched in many emerging markets, with the result that their central banks will be forced to keep interest rates high well into next year, thereby delaying any pick-up in economic activity. “When inflation comes down, that gives emerging markets some breathing space,” he said, but added: “It’s going to be bumpy.”  Rising global interest rates are usually bad for emerging economies. They discourage foreign investment in stocks and bonds by providing appealing and less risky options in advanced economies. And they increase borrowing costs for governments and businesses, making them less able to invest in productive activity. Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade body for the financial industry, said a reduction in the size of US rate rises would undo some of the damage caused by bigger than expected increases this year. “It was upside inflation surprises and the Fed’s accelerated hiking cycle that weighed on EM currencies in the second half of 2022,” he said. “That shock is ending, which sets the stage for EM recovery.” But Adam Wolfe, emerging market economist at consultancy Absolute Strategy Research, said that, even if the Fed started cutting interest rates next year, central banks in emerging economies may not be able to follow.  “If the Fed is cutting, it’s because it is worried about growth,” he said. If the US goes into recession next year, as many analysts expect, it will make investors reluctant to buy risky assets including emerging market stocks and bonds. Investment funds that buy such assets suffered their biggest outflows on record this year before staging a recovery last month on the promise of lower US rates. A US recession would prompt a resumption of outflows, analysts warned. Many emerging market central banks began raising interest rates early and aggressively last year as inflation started to climb, including those in Hungary, Poland, Mexico and Chile. Brazil began hiking in March 2021, 12 months ahead of the Fed, eventually taking its policy rate from 2 per cent to 13.75 per cent. Consumer price inflation peaked above 12 per cent in April and has since fallen below 6 per cent.  In Mexico, too, inflation at 7.8 per cent has fallen below the policy rate of 10 per cent. Where it remains high, as in Poland and Hungary, it is expected to fall next year. In several countries in Latin America and eastern Europe, where inflation is particularly high, government bond yield curves have become inverted, suggesting that markets expect rate cuts from next year. But some analysts say central banks are unlikely to cut rates soon.  One reason is that inflation in many economies has spread far beyond food and fuel prices, meaning it will remain high even as those prices fall from their recent peaks. And if the US does enter recession, emerging market central banks will have to keep rates high to protect their currencies from the impact of outflows. Otherwise, rising import prices will push inflation higher still. Wolfe said the US dollar would have to lose value against other currencies before emerging market central banks could cut. “That’s why I’m sceptical that central banks will be able to deliver the cuts that are expected,” he said. For dozens of low-income countries, any relief from looser US monetary policy will come too late to protect them from the risk of debt default caused by soaring borrowing costs.  Zambia and Sri Lanka — a rare case of a middle-income country in debt crisis — defaulted during the pandemic. Ghana agreed an IMF bailout this week; Egypt is expected to follow. Large emerging economies are less likely to fall into a debt crisis. But for them, too, higher borrowing costs leave governments less able to support growth through investment, while many have failed to deliver the structural reforms that would allow private investment to take the lead. Narain at UBS said he expected emerging markets in aggregate to grow more slowly next year than at any time since 1980, apart from the first pandemic year of 2020. UBS expects overall emerging market growth of just 3.5 per cent in 2023, a fraction lower than this year. Excluding China, UBS forecasts emerging market growth of just 2.5 per cent in 2023, down from 4.5 per cent this year. Narain said leading indicators of economic activity in China showed a reduction in capital expenditure, meaning that China will no longer be a driver of export-led growth for other emerging economies. He predicted emerging economies would enjoy some relief from lower global rates in the coming months, before a US recession makes them vulnerable again.

"Top IMF official warns of ‘acute’ risks in global financial system","Tobias Adrian says banks and other groups are being ‘tested’ by higher interest rates","A top official at the IMF has warned of “acute” risks to the global financial system and said weaker banks face further pressure if central banks continue ratcheting up rates to squash inflation.  In an interview with the Financial Times, Tobias Adrian, director of the fund’s monetary and capital markets department, struck a downbeat tone in the wake of the worst bout of banking turmoil since the global financial crisis. Last month, three US banks failed while Credit Suisse was forced to sell to UBS.  The IMF is worried that inflation will not decline as rapidly as expected this year, forcing central banks to tighten monetary policy even further and unmasking new weaknesses in the financial system.   “The financial system is being tested by the stresses that are being triggered by monetary policy tightening,” Adrian said. “The risk going forward is that the situation could create more stressors for the financial system.” Adrian’s comments came as the IMF released its latest Global Financial Stability Report, which warned financial risks had “increased rapidly” since its last update in October. Adrian described those risks as “acute at the moment”. In the report, the IMF said regulatory changes implemented since the 2008 crisis had “made the financial system generally more resilient” but said there was a “fundamental question” over whether the recent banking turmoil was a “harbinger of more systemic stress”.  Asked if that turmoil had been contained, Adrian said it had “ended well so far, but there are significant vulnerabilities that remain”.  Adrian listed several risks for banks, including paper losses on bondholdings that have increased in line with rate rises, as well as higher funding costs. These costs would increase further in the event of “upside surprises” for inflation and interest rates, he said.  “When you look at the cross section of banks, there are some very, very strong players but there are also some weak ones [that are] vulnerable to further shocks.”  Per the IMF’s estimates, nearly 9 per cent of US banks with assets between $10bn and $300bn would fail to meet capital requirements if they were to fully account for unrealised losses on securities they intend to hold to maturity in addition to those they plan to sell before then.  “This suggests that interest rate risks could intensify for some small banks should interest rates stay higher for longer and were they forced to sell these securities to raise liquidity,” wrote the IMF report’s authors.  In the report, the IMF also flagged vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector, which includes hedge funds, pension funds, insurers and other asset managers.  Adrian pointed to the turmoil that gripped the UK pensions industry in the autumn following the government’s botched release of its budget as one example of a danger lurking in the non-bank sector.  The Bank of England was forced to intervene to stem contagion, a development that the Adrian described as a “wake-up call”. He also noted that the meltdown of family office Archegos Capital Management in 2021 had generated losses in excess of $10bn for some of the world’s biggest banks. “There’s a lot of opacity in the non-banks. The total magnitude of risk is sometimes difficult to understand.”   Central banks that have been mostly focused on fighting inflation must now also consider the effects of tighter monetary policy on the broader financial system.  Adrian said monetary authorities had been “quite successful in separating financial stability goals from price stability goals. “However, there are scenarios of severe financial crisis [and] severe systemic distress where this clean separation is much more tenuous.”","11.04.2023"
"Why Ukraine is tightening anti-graft rules before aid billions start flowing","Also in today’s newsletter: How Europe lost its prime trade relationship with Brazil","This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday and Saturday morning Good morning. The EU yesterday offered Tunisia more than €1bn in aid, in an attempt to avert an economic crisis in the country — and a desperate effort to stem the flow of migrants fleeing across the Mediterranean to Italy. Today, we hear from the anti-fraud officials already working to protect the hundreds of billions of reconstruction dollars forecast to flow into Ukraine, and take stock of Europe’s faltering trade relationship with Brazil. The accountants Even as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of ending, efforts are already taking shape to ensure that reconstruction money is not siphoned off by fraudsters, writes Alice Hancock.  Context: A joint study led by the World Bank estimated in March that $411bn will be required for Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction needs over a decade. By comparison, the Marshall Plan — funding from the US to rebuild Europe after the second world war — amounted to about $150bn in today’s money. “A huge amount of money will be needed to rebuild Ukraine one day. The EU and Ukraine will have to work together to ensure the accountability of that money coming from [EU] citizens,” Ville Itälä, head of Olaf, the EU’s anti-fraud watchdog, told the FT. The EU has committed to setting up a Rebuild Ukraine fund composed of grants and loans but has not attached a figure to it. A reconstruction conference will be held in London this month. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been quick to react to hints of fraud in his government as he continues to plead with western partners for support, while a fraud trial opening in London today pitting Ukraine’s largest bank against its former oligarch owners is seen as a key test of Kyiv’s anti-corruption credentials. Itälä said the difficulty with the reconstruction effort would be in ensuring that money coming from myriad international sources went to worthy projects: “With the Marshall Plan back then it was one donor, now it is many donors.” Olaf’s offices are busy: Andriy Kostin, prosecutor-general of Ukraine, visited at the end of April to discuss monitoring funds, and talks about Ukrainian access to EU funds dedicated to anti-graft efforts are continuing. Officials from the World Bank will be visiting this week, while Ukrainian officials are expected to come to Brussels to train with Olaf on fighting corruption soon.  Last week, Ukraine set up a group, to be chaired by its deputy prime minister for science and innovation Mykhailo Fedorov, that will oversee the roll out of anti-graft digital tools across its government. With an eye to its future EU accession, Kyiv has also set in train work on a series of European Commission recommendations to fight fraud, including a state anti-corruption programme and a “de-oligarchisation” law. “Tailored legislation, strong anti-corruption institutions and digitalisation will foster the necessary trust and confidence of foreign governments, institutions and investors in Ukraine’s reconstruction,” said Vsevolod Chentsov, Ukraine’s ambassador to the EU. But Itälä warned that every caution had to be taken: “Where there is big money that needs to be spent quickly, fraudsters try to take advantage.” Chart du jour: Out of time  The world’s remaining “carbon budget” will be exhausted in less than six years at current emissions levels, scientists have warned. Natural partners? Commission president Ursula von der Leyen lands in Brasília today for a tour of Latin American capitals as business groups warn that other rivals are usurping the EU’s trade relationship with Brazil, writes Ian Johnston.  Context: Brussels called Latin America its “natural partner” last week as it kicked off a diplomatic push set to culminate in July with the first EU summit with Latin American and Caribbean states since 2015. In those years of neglect, rivals including China have consolidated their position in the region.  Protectionism and fragmentation risk exacerbating the “unfortunate decline of the relevance of the EU-Brazil commercial relationship in favour of other major competitors”, warn Brazil’s national confederation of Industry, CNI, and lobby group Business Europe. Europe was once Brazil’s main trading partner but now lies in third place in terms of imports, behind the US and China. Brazil has also fallen behind India and South Korea in the EU’s ranking of trading partners. Bilateral trade between Brazil and the EU is rising, reaching a record high of nearly €90.5bn last year. But CNI and Business Europe warn that relations are “far below their full potential”. Ratifying the Mercosur trade agreement would bring the relationship “back on track”, the groups say. Negotiators should show “appropriate flexibility to reach a balanced, time-sensitive agreement that delivers for both societies”.  But the EU is waiting for the Latin American bloc’s response to requests for stronger environmental commitments.

"Belgium defends handling of ‘Qatargate’ corruption probe","Unprecedented investigation at the European parliament has run into procedural problems","Five months into a corruption probe that shook the EU establishment, Belgian authorities have defended their record amid criticism about the handling of this case. After the unprecedented raids and arrests at the European parliament and the seizure of €1.5mn in cash in December, the main suspects have all been released under electronic surveillance at their homes in Brussels, while Italy has yet to transfer two other suspects wanted in Belgium. Morocco and Qatar, two countries accused of bribing EU lawmakers to lobby on their behalf, have rejected any wrongdoing and called the case a smear campaign.  “Some of the countries which are related obviously were not happy with the work that our legal services have done,” Belgium’s prime minister Alexander De Croo said last month, “I think our investigators did a good job, which is not always easy because . . . some of the countries obviously have been quite harsh,” De Croo added.  The exchange of documents and paperwork between Belgium and Italy has been slow, including because of the language barrier, according to people close to the investigation. Italy has opened its own investigation into multiple individuals involved in a network of companies allegedly set up to hide the trace of illegal payments. But none of the suspects have been questioned owing to what appears to be procedural delays, those people said.  For example, MEP Andrea Cozzolino and the accountant of the main suspect, Monica Rossana Bellini, are awaiting a transfer decision and therefore neither Italian nor Belgium authorities have yet questioned them on the details of their alleged involvement. Both Cozzolino and Bellini deny any wrongdoing. Judges in Naples and Milan postponed their decision on the transfer of the two Italian nationals to Belgium, citing a lack of detail in the request for Bellini and concerns over Cozzolino’s health. The European transfer requests, which are supposed to facilitate extradition between EU member states, have instead caused months-long delays, the people added.  Cozzolino is under house arrest in Naples, while Bellini — who set up Equality Srl, the company at the centre of the Italian investigation — was released from house arrest in Milan in February.  The judge leading the investigation in Belgium, Michel Claise, told the Financial Times that the investigations would take “the time that’s needed.” “I’m not here to hang trophies on the wall. On the contrary, I’m here to prevent the slightest error,” said Claise, who is in charge of approving wiretaps, raids and arrests warrants.  In the run-up to the December busts, Belgian investigators installed surveillance cameras at the home of the self-confessed kingpin, former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri, caught on tape handing out envelopes of cash embossed with Santa Claus and joking about being “like in Ocean’s Eleven”. Claise said his work was not an easy one. “Let’s just say I’ve had some pitfalls,” he said. “It’s a job that disturbs.” The magistrate made a name for himself by taking on white collar crime in the banking sector, including a money laundering and tax fraud probe into UBS launched in 2014. One person close to the investigation in Brussels said Claise was under political pressure to loosen his grip on countries deemed crucial trade partners and diplomatic allies for the bloc amid growing global tensions.  The Belgian judge said he had not faced any political pressure. But he did not rule it out for other parts of his country’s judiciary. “No one comes into my office and tells me what to do. Never. That’s the advantage of having an investigating judge,” Claise said. “The prosecution is less independent than that.” He added that this applied “a little” to the federal prosecutor, as well as to the other prosecutorial levels in his country’s devolved judiciary.  The Belgian federal prosecutor’s office rejected any suggestion that it was not acting independently. “It is not a question of who is more independent or less independent. Every moment of the Belgian judicial system is regulated by law, there is no question of derogating from it,” a spokesperson said.  To the question whether more was to come in the “Qatargate” investigation in Belgium, Claise replied: “I can promise you that after spring will come summer.” ","07.05.2023"
"FirstFT: US corporate borrowing plans hit by slowdown ","Also in today’s newsletter, the desperate search for the Titan submersible and Singapore’s SWF targets the US","Corporate America is feeling the pinch from the slowdown in Wall Street’s $1.4tn market for junk-rated loans, with a growing list of companies forced either to pay more or abandon borrowing plans. A loan extension for California utility PG&E was shelved last month, while Heartland Dental, a provider of services to dentists’ offices, and digital media business Internet Brands had to pay lenders more or agree to tougher investor protections in return for extending loan maturities, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Borrowers have been hit by shifts in the market for collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, the investment vehicles that own roughly two-thirds of lowly rated US corporate loans.  Over the past decade these loans have become a critical funding source both for US companies and private equity groups snapping up businesses. CLOs buy up hundreds of different loans, package them and use the interest payments they generate to fund new slices of debt, which are then sold on to banks, insurers and other investors. As an alternative to tapping the CLO market, some companies are now selling fixed-rate debt in the form of high-yield bonds or opting for shorter maturing loans.

"Bull market in US stocks fails to lift investors’ mood","Blue-chip S&P 500 index is 20% above October 2022 low but shareholders are not celebrating ","US stocks are motoring, but investors are not ready to celebrate just yet. This week’s gains in the blue-chip S&P 500 index mean it now stands more than 20 per cent above its October 2022 low, nudging the Wall Street benchmark into the widely-used definition of a bull market.  But persistent concerns about the true health of the US economy and anxiety over the tiny number of stocks driving gains are still sapping enthusiasm among fund managers.  “While many investors believe that passing this milestone puts markets in bull territory, it remains possible that we are seeing a bear market rally — a period of strong gains that occurs in the middle of a bear market,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Until markets reach a new all-time high, it’s impossible to know whether the bear market trough — the ultimate low of the market cycle — is behind us. We recommend investors continue to exercise caution,” she said. An all-time high is still 12 per cent away, but stocks’ upward momentum this year is hard to ignore. The rally is at odds with a widespread downbeat tone among money managers, most of whom came into this year expecting a recession that has yet to arrive. A string of upbeat data, particularly on employment levels, has complicated that view and left many investors struggling for direction. “I think there’s a much higher probability that surprises continue to be positive rather than negative,” said Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America. “But I can’t find an unequivocally bullish investor.” A key preoccupation is persistent US inflation, which raises the prospect that the Federal Reserve has not yet finished with its aggressive interest rate increases. That policy could potentially worsen any downturn and pull down bond prices and the value of tech stocks in particular — a typical pattern that played out last year. Central banks’ battle against inflation “does not support the bulls’ thesis”, said Lewis Grant, portfolio manager for global equities at Federated Hermes.  The narrow nature of the rally has exacerbated the hesitation, with just seven big stocks responsible for the S&P 500’s 12 per cent gain this year.  “For all the brash headlines, away from a couple sectors and a select group of stocks, markets haven’t done much”, said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “All the talk of a bull market seems to create the hype that investors are missing something, but that really isn’t what has been happening.”  Anyone tracking the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — a strategy that dulls the impact of a few heavyhitters — is up less than 3 per cent this year.  “Investors like a lot of little confirmations of their biases and here they’ve got 400-something stocks that seem to be telling them something less positive,” said Jonathan Golub, chief US market strategist at Credit Suisse. “But here’s the bottom line: we’re only interested in weighted average returns, not the average return. And these big companies count a lot more.”   The seven leaders are all in tech: Nvidia, Tesla, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta. Exposure to the potential of generative artificial intelligence has boosted Nvidia, Microsoft and Google in particular.  “While these leading tech companies have become more expensive, they’ve also seen their earnings outlook improve which is clearly part of this story,” added Golub.  Morgan Stanley’s equity strategy team this week renewed its call for a tactical bear market in a longer-term bull run, based on a cut to its earnings forecasts.  “If this new inflationary regime mirrors the post-WWII period, it will be volatile with significant cyclical ups and downs that should be traded if one wants to fully capture excess returns,” the team wrote in a report to clients. “In short, the boom/bust period that began in 2020 is currently in the bust part of the earnings cycle — a dynamic that’s not yet priced, in our view.” “Durable bull markets tend to begin when earnings estimates bottom”, said Sean O’Malley, head of strategy at $2.3bn hedge fund Cadian Capital. “Broad market earnings estimates are falling and don’t seem to have bottomed”. The mood has improved a little. Goldman Sachs’ market sentiment indicator has turned positive for the first time since the autumn, while a weekly survey by the US National Association of Active Investment Managers showed the biggest one-week jump in its members’ equity positions in two years and their highest holdings since November 2021.  Next week’s Fed meeting could spur fresh gains — or confirm investor jitters. While the central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday, futures markets suggest a further quarter-point rate rise in July has been priced in following a series of bumper economic reports. Investors have yet to decide whether stronger data boosts the soft-landing scenario, or sparks fresh worries that an over-hawkish Fed will push the economy into recession.

"Europe’s art market faces chill wind blowing in from the US","The Art Basel fair will be a test of whether the recent global boom has come to an end","After a strong recent run, the art market might have expected to continue its bullish sprint. But a cooling became apparent last month at Frieze New York, where dealers say price tags for works that sold were generally below $1mn, and at the city’s flagship auctions, which offered mixed results. The question for the 284 galleries at this year’s edition of Art Basel (June 15-18) is whether this chill wind, driven by economic uncertainty, blows all the way to Europe. The fair will be a major test for the Modern and contemporary art market, as will London’s June auction series. “Frieze [in New York] seemed more of a slow burn than a one-day frenzy but I think the best works sold as expected,” says Miami-based art adviser Lisa Austin. Meanwhile, Sotheby’s contemporary art sales in New York just met expectations and Christie’s offering of 65 works from the late Bostonian collector Gerald Fineberg were also underwhelming. Big players in the market are acknowledging the slowdown. A Christie’s spokesperson says: “In May we saw a real correction which was already palpable in November 2022, but not a crash or a collapse of the market. With the right estimates and sales formats, the market continues to be lively.” The auction house pointed to strong prices for works by Henri Rousseau and Jean-Michel Basquiat and successful day sales. ‘Bacchus’ (1983) by Elaine de Kooning . . .  © Elaine de Kooning, courtesy the artist/Almine Rech.

Photo: Melissa Castro Duarte “The market is readjusting and moving away from the frenzy of the past few years,” says a spokesperson for French gallery Almine Rech, echoing a sentiment shared by many across the art trade. In Basel, the gallery is showing a painting by Elaine de Kooning from her Bacchus series along with new works by UK artist Hew Locke (prices on the booth range from $80,000 to $3mn).  During the past 12 months, Europe has been holding up. “European fairs such as Tefaf Maastricht and Art Paris were successful for us in terms of sales,” says Yves Zlotowski, the director of Galerie Zlotowski, which is dedicating its booth to “avant-garde queen” Sonia Delaunay, offering pieces such as her “Rayures” gouache (1949, around €80,000). US and European collectors currently hold sway in the market but there are hopes that collectors from the rest of the world are picking up the slack. Those moving things forward are from Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, says Lorenzo Fiaschi, co-founder of Galleria Continua, which is showing works by Anish Kapoor and Adel Abdessemed at Art Basel. ‘Tortue’ (2015) by Adel Abdessemed © Adel Abdessemed, courtesy the artist/Galleria Continua. Photo: the artist “There might be some slowing down but we don’t feel it as the overall market is constantly growing, including new collectors in Asia we didn’t know two years ago,” adds gallerist Thaddaeus Ropac. Asia has become a key power in the art market in the past decade, but it is very China-dependent. The UK narrowly overtook China as the second biggest market in 2022, according to the latest Art Market report published by Art Basel and UBS. Once the Basel fair is done, attention tuns to London. “We hope and we expect our June sales in London to confirm the market still responds well when works are at the right estimate,” says the spokesperson from Christie’s. The auction house is banking on a 1984 Basquiat work depicting Picasso (est £4.5mn-£6.5mn) to perform well.  “A cooling in the market can create great opportunities as collectors become more focused on finding quality with value,” says Liza Essers, director of the Johannesburg and London-based Goodman Gallery. At Art Basel, the gallery will show “The African Library” by Yinka Shonibare (£1.5mn) in the Unlimited section as well as works by “rising talents” including Nolan Oswald Dennis, Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum and Misheck Masamvu ($10,000-$60,000). ‘Eye of the Storm’ (2023) by Misheck Masamvu © Courtesy the artist/Goodman Gallery According to New York based art adviser Candace Worth, it is worth seeing “the market” as a more complex organism: “It is comprised of thousands of micro-markets and while prices for many artists’ work have softened, many others remain strong and robust and maybe even overinflated.” And if some collectors are falling out of the market, the pool is widening with the new thirtysomething generation, she adds.  Worth adds that dealers bringing blue-chip secondary-market material to Art Basel are bracing nonetheless for a less competitive buying pool. “Buyers are definitely showing more caution at the higher price points, over $1mn.” But numerous younger and mid-career artists continue to have long waiting lists and deep buying pools for their work, she says. Florence-based collector Christian Levett thinks the more diverse areas of the market still stand to gain. “Galleries are getting behind large numbers of contemporary artists, particularly women and multicultural practitioners, building demand over supply for those artists, often at lightning speeds, with a similar effect on their auction prices,” he says. The art world, as lustrous and hermetic as it might seem, is nevertheless at the mercy of real-world issues, such as a potential escalation of the war in Ukraine or worsening economic data. “Inflation and the rise in interest rates have caused a gyration in the financial markets over the last 12 months and have maybe led to a pause in some buyers’ minds,” says Levett. In this climate, all eyes will be on who walks through the doors in Basel next week, and whether sales are made across the board. artbasel.com","09.06.2023"
"The rise of adult diagnoses of neurodiversity","Also in today’s newsletter, the rush to buy Credit Suisse ‘merch’","This article is an on-site version of our Working It newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday It’s World Autism Acceptance Week. I have to admit that this year is the first time I have been aware of its existence, but its higher profile in 2023 reflects a wider trend of rising awareness, acceptance and also celebration of neurodiversity in workplaces and in society. The term “neurodiverse” is itself fairly new — it was coined in 1998, by an Australian academic, Judy Singer, as part of her doctoral thesis. Her original work was focused on autism self-advocacy groups, and the emerging movements among people with other conditions who sought an umbrella term for their common cause. It’s extraordinary to think that as recently as the start of the 21st century, most of us would not have had the language to talk about colleagues or family members who are wired differently, or to think about these conditions in a positive way.  I delved further into this topic while researching this week’s Working It podcast, which is focused on how to manage, or work with, neurodiverse colleagues — and on navigating workplaces for those who are neurodiverse themselves. To record it, we went out to London’s Docklands to the Neurodiversity in Business conference.  Isabel Berwick, left, and Working It producer Audrey Tinline recording on location at the Neurodiversity in Business conference in London  This is also something that’s very important to me personally — my husband recently received an adult diagnosis of ADHD. It’s been very important in making sense of the past, as well as allowing us to think differently about the future. Our experience reflects a wider pattern: a rising number of adult diagnoses of neurodiversity is part of what’s driving the societal shift that is making conditions such as autism, ADHD, dyspraxia and dyslexia far more visible than ever before.   Below, I share some tips I learned on how to break the cycle of workplaces being “reactive” on issues of neurodiversity.  For more on this topic, I recommend revisiting Emma Jacobs’s story from earlier this month on the benefits of revealing neurodiversity in the workplace. Top stories from the world of work: Succession is painful but it doesn’t need to be. As the final series of Succession begins, author and management expert Margaret Heffernan explores the addiction to adrenaline, stress and long hours that keeps CEOs in their jobs too long.

Items like Lehman Brothers tote bags, Bear Stearns hats and Bernard Madoff paperweights attract high prices online. How to be proactive about creating a neuroinclusive workplace  The rise diagnoses of neurodiverse conditions means that employers need to create an environment where — to use the words we heard at the conference — “neurominority people” can thrive. Nancy Doyle, founder of Genius Within, a consultancy that works with neurodiverse individuals, with companies and inside the UK prison system. She’s neurodiverse herself, and has helped to set up the UK’s first research centre dedicated to neurodiversity at work, in collaboration with Birkbeck, University of London.  Nancy outlines the recent shift in workplaces and how employers can help. “So where we’ve been for the last 20 years is this very reactive place where we wait for people to put their hands up and say, ‘Oh, I’m struggling. Can I have some help? Please?’ And then we help them one person at a time. And where we are going is a bit more strategic and forward thinking.” Nancy believes that businesses first need to look back. “What businesses need to be doing is to look back through their HR data, through their experience and go what kind of accommodations have we had to make? Where have we made adjustments for people that have worked? How frequently does this come up?”  And she suggests that managers start by talking to the neurodivergent staff they already have, to “find out how to make your onboarding more neuroinclusive, how to manage performance in more concrete and explainable ways. And how to do wellbeing in a neurodivergent friendly style. Think about your environment, the sensory input that people are getting. Is it too overwhelming?” A recent report from tech training agency Sparta Global highlights the benefits that neurodiverse staff bring to the workplace. It interviewed 500 staff at different levels across the digital businesses it serves, and gathered data on the benefits of recruiting and retaining neurodiverse teams across different workplace functions.  Historically many people — those who know they are neurodiverse — have “masked” at work and not told anyone. In the Sparta report, 83 per cent of the neurodiverse staff interviewed reported feeling anxiety before disclosing their condition at work.  One of Sparta’s most striking positive findings is that “neurodiverse teams show higher adaptability levels. This is because they leverage diverse perspectives and problem-solving approaches to address complex issues both quickly and efficiently. In areas such as AI and machine learning, these competencies can drive new solutions.”  In other words, as workplaces automate, neurodiverse teams are going to be well-placed to meet the challenges ahead. (Isabel Berwick) A word from the Working It community Female staff line up for a visit by the Queen to the LSE  Last week’s feature by Katie Martin, marking 50 years since the first women were admitted to work on the trading floor at the London Stock Exchange provided a chance for many FT readers to share their own early memories of working in male-dominated fields.   JakobFDR reflected on how much things have changed for women in the past 50 years:  My first job in the early 1990s was as junior clerk for a barristers’ chambers. The level of crude, truly misogynistic remarks and wandering hands from older male QCs was, in hindsight, mind blowing. By today’s standards, career-ending. JAC NY commented on how the poor treatment of women in finance affected retention:  Why couldn’t the City and Wall Street keep women? Because no one stopped this.

"Back to life","A round of diplomatic meetings, economic reports and an earnings season in full flourish make for a busy diary","This article is an on-site version of our The Week Ahead newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Sunday Hello and welcome to the working week. It’s over. A once in several decades combination of Abrahamic religious festivals, I mean. Corporate and political life on the other hand has been cranking up for a busy new season, as illustrated by this week’s diary. In the US, rumours are swirling that Joe Biden will announce his bid for the 2024 presidential contest. What he will definitely be doing is hosting his South Korean counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol at the White House.  EU foreign ministers will gather in Luxembourg on Monday for a video conference with their Ukraine counterpart Dmytro Kuleba before discussing an action plan to respond further to the Russian aggression and other global conflicts — tragically, an expanding list. Finance ministers and central bank governors will arrive in Stockholm on Friday for an informal meeting that will include discussion on helping finance Ukraine’s reconstruction. The British government will be doing its bit for the City of London’s diplomatic business mission on Tuesday when foreign secretary James Cleverly speaks at the annual Easter Banquet at Mansion House, the Lord Mayor of London’s official residence. Can it really only be 12 months since this was being delivered by then foreign secretary, now also ex-prime minister, Liz Truss? Then there is the story of UK industrial unrest, driven by pay and cost of living concerns. This week will see further walkouts by teachers and civil servants among others in what has now become a spring of discontent. As regular readers know, the Week Ahead exists to look forward on your behalf, but sometimes it’s important to reflect.

Headline acts are the first estimate first-quarter GDP numbers for the US, South Korea and the eurozone. There will also be provisional consumer price index (CPI) and harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) inflation reports from various EU countries, plus Germany’s Ifo and GfK business climate reports.   The main event in Japan is the rate-setting meeting, which concludes on Friday. The newly appointed Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda has stressed that for the time being he will stick to the decade-long ultra-loose monetary policy inherited from his predecessor. But the markets are wary that this position might shift, especially after March’s core CPI was higher than expected at 3.8 per cent, its highest year-on-year level since 1981. Companies Earnings season is in full swing. We have more banks this week, with a particular focus on the UK’s high street lenders, as well as earnings calls from both Credit Suisse and UBS.  It is also a big week for Big Tech with quarterly results from Amazon.com, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft. The latter will also have an eye on the UK, where on Wednesday the Competition and Markets Authority is due to finally rule on whether to block the technology company’s $69bn takeover of games maker Activision Blizzard, although this is likely to prove a damp squib as the CMA is expected to support it. It will also be a big week for consumer goods company results, at a time when both the cost of living and obesity concerns are high on the agenda. What will Nestlé have to say when it reports numbers on Tuesday after its dressing down by institutional investors last week? If people think the Swiss multinational is bad, what about McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Domino’s Pizza, Mondelēz and Hershey, all of whom will also be reporting results?

"‘Persistent’ inflation trumped bank turmoil fears in ECB rate rise move","Most officials stressed need to separate monetary policy from financial stability risks, minutes of March meeting show","Most rate-setters at the European Central Bank pushed for it to separate concern about turmoil in the banking sector from its efforts to tame inflation by raising interest rates when they met last month. The outcome of last month’s ECB meeting, which came less than a week after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and only a couple of days before Credit Suisse was pushed into the arms of its rival UBS, underlined how concern about high inflation remained paramount among rate-setters. Some ECB policymakers cited the “separation principle” to argue that monetary policy should be assessed independently of financial stability risks before they pressed ahead with a widely expected half-percentage point rate rise, according to the account of the March 16 meeting published on Thursday.  “Unless the situation deteriorated significantly, the financial market tensions were unlikely to fundamentally change the governing council’s assessment of the inflation outlook,” the ECB said. “In light of the risk of persistent inflation dynamics, the ECB’s monetary policy had to be persistent as well.” Since then, several members of the ECB’s rate-setting governing council have said they expect it to keep raising rates at its next meeting on May 4, while adding that it could slow the pace to a quarter-percentage point rise depending on data due in the next two weeks. There was also scepticism among several council members at March’s meeting that its forecasts for inflation to fall steadily over the next few years were too optimistic. Some said its forecast for price growth to drop from an average of 5.3 per cent this year to 2.1 per cent in 2025 “gave the impression of an ‘immaculate disinflation’”. The doubters pointed to above-forecast inflation figures in February and said “the strengthening of wage growth was consistent with second-round effects having already started”. They cited several “risk factors” that could keep inflation high, including generous fiscal policy by eurozone member states, which bolster the case for more rate rises.  After last month’s meeting, ECB president Christine Lagarde said there was “no trade-off” between its objectives of maintaining financial stability and raising rates to bring down inflation. She also said rates were likely to move higher if the ECB’s baseline inflation forecast remained unaffected by the upheaval in the banking sector. There were a handful of dissenters among the council’s 26 members, who called for a pause in rate rises to assess the impact of the banking sector’s problems.  They argued that “the risks from not raising rates, if the tensions turned out to be shortlived, were assessed to be much less severe than the risks associated with raising rates into a persistent crisis”. But they were outnumbered by those wanting to increase rates.  Andrew Kenningham, an economist at research group Capital Economics, said the ECB’s account of the March meeting “confirms that it was only the banking sector turbulence that deterred policymakers from signalling further rate hikes to come”. He added that as banking failures “have now subsided” it would keep lifting rates, forecasting a rise in its deposit rate from 3 per cent to a peak of 4 per cent over the coming months. Isabel Schnabel, an ECB executive board member, said in a speech on Wednesday that the extra complexity created by recent banking tumult made it impossible for her to say what it would do at future meetings.  But Schnabel presented data showing “inflation momentum remains high for all components except energy” and that the recent banking failures had hit US financial markets harder than those in the eurozone, while fiscal policy had become more expansionary in the euro area than in the US — developments that are likely to favour further ECB rate rises.","20.04.2023"
"Goldman Sachs hit by trading slowdown as it accelerates retail pullback","Wall Street group sells $1bn of consumer loans and announces plan to divest GreenSky","Goldman Sachs’ first-quarter profits slumped 18 per cent following a lacklustre performance at its fixed-income trading unit as the Wall Street bank stepped up efforts to unwind an ill-fated foray into consumer banking.  The results underscore the difficult task facing chief executive David Solomon, who is trying to engineer the pullback from consumer banking at a time when Goldman’s traditional trading and dealmaking businesses are under pressure.  They also come at a time of flagging morale at Goldman, after the bank embarked on a major cost-cutting drive including more than 3,000 job cuts in January following what Solomon had described as a “disappointing” end to 2022.   The bank’s trading arm, which has benefited from volatile financial markets amid aggressive rate rises from central banks and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reported revenues of $6.9bn for the first three months of the year, just shy of analysts’ forecasts.  The miss was driven by a disappointing performance in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading, where revenues fell 17 per cent to $3.9bn. That missed analysts’ expectations and lagged behind rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which recently reported an increase during the same period. In a call with analysts, Solomon defended the unit’s performance and said it would have been a tall order to beat last year’s number, when Goldman posted a big jump in FICC trading revenues while “the competitor average was kind of flat or down”.  Meanwhile, Goldman took some of its biggest steps to date to reverse a big push into retail banking that fell out of favour with investors following years of losses, selling $1bn of consumer loans and hoisting the “for sale” sign over a company it acquired little more than a year ago.  The sale of part of the loan book and a change in how it accounts for the remaining assets — which have been marked as “available for sale” — resulted in a $470mn loss in the quarter, which was partly offset by the release of $440mn of credit reserves. Solomon told analysts the loan sale was a sign the bank was “narrowing our focus in the consumer space”.  Solomon also announced the bank was initiating the sale of GreenSky, which lends to customers making home improvements, just 13 months after Goldman completed the $2.2bn acquisition and trumpeted it as a evidence the group was building the “consumer banking platform of the future”.   Goldman has since concluded it “may not be the best long-term holder of this business” given the bank’s “current strategic priorities”, Solomon said.  Autonomous Research analyst Christian Bolu said he expected the sale of GreenSky to result in further losses, pointing out the bank had agreed the deal at “the top of the market for fintech companies”. Investment banking, meanwhile, continued to suffer from a recent slowdown in dealmaking, with revenue in the first quarter falling 26 per cent versus a year ago to $1.58bn. That was roughly in line with similar declines reported last week by JPMorgan and Citi. The bank’s asset and wealth management division, the cornerstone of Solomon’s efforts to diversify away from trading and investment banking, reported revenue of $3.2bn, 24 per cent higher than a year ago but still behind analysts’ expectations.  Solomon said Goldman saw an opportunity to sign up wealthy clients in Europe who are looking to bank with new groups following the Swiss government-brokered sale of Credit Suisse to UBS.  “Our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients,” Solomon said.   Overall, Goldman’s first-quarter net income of $3.2bn beat analysts’ expectations. However, revenues fell 5 per cent versus last year to $12.2bn, missing consensus forecasts. Its shares closed down 1.7 per cent. Goldman’s operating expenses, a key focus following the bank’s spending review earlier this year, rose 9 per cent at $8.4bn, higher than analysts’ estimates of about $8.1bn.","18.04.2023"
"JPMorgan says it may have to pay more for deposits in ‘warning shot’ for industry ","Net income for final three months of 2022 was $11bn, up 6% year on year","JPMorgan Chase said it might be forced to pay more for deposits this year in what analysts called “a warning shot for the entire industry”. Like other Wall Street banks, JPMorgan has benefited from Federal Reserve interest rate rises boosting net interest income — the difference in what banks pay on deposits and what they earn from loans and other assets.  Fourth-quarter earnings on Friday showed JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, raked in a record $20.3bn in net interest income, an increase of 48 per cent over the same period last year.  However, JPMorgan said it was expecting net interest income for 2023, excluding its trading division, to be about $74bn — well below what many analysts had forecast. The guidance was “not only below consensus of $75.5bn, but below the bullish buyside base case of $76bn to $77bn”, said UBS analysts. While banks have been able to charge more for loans, they have only passed on more modest rate increases to deposit holders, boosting profit margins.  Bigger banks such as JPMorgan went into 2022 sitting on record levels of deposits thanks to pandemic-era stimulus programmes.  But in an early sign that customers are willing to move their money in search of a better return, JPMorgan said deposits in the fourth quarter were $2.4tn, down 4 per cent from a year earlier. This was the bank’s first year-on-year decline since 2016. JPMorgan said the outlook for lifting deposit rates was “uncertain” but indicated that its company-wide average cost of deposits could rise from about 1 per cent in 2022 to up to 2 per cent in 2023. The bank estimates that every basis point move higher is an extra $250mn of interest cost.   The warning shot from JPMorgan, as the UBS analysts put it, came as the bank reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $11bn, or $3.57 per share, up 6 per cent from the same period last year.  Analysts had estimated quarterly net income would fall to $9.3bn, or $3.10 per share, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan reported earnings on Friday along with Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.  BofA said its net interest income rose 29 per cent year on year to $14.7bn, at Citi it was up 23 per cent to $13.3bn and Wells Fargo grew net interest income 45 per cent to $13.4bn.  JPMorgan shares had started Friday down about 3 per cent but pared losses in morning New York trading to trade up slightly. BofA was down 0.6 per cent and Citi was down 0.1 per cent.  Wells reported overall profits down by half in the last quarter of 2022 after being hit with multibillion-dollar fines. Its shares fell almost 1.3 per cent. JPMorgan also provisioned in the fourth quarter a net $1.4bn for potential credit losses. The bank said the build-up of reserves was “driven by a modest deterioration in . . . macroeconomic outlook, now reflecting a mild recession in the central case”.  “We don’t know. It may be a mild recession, it may not,” chief executive Jamie Dimon told reporters. “I’m simply pointing out that there are the geopolitical uncertainties, which are real, and we just have our eyes focused on it.” Investment banking revenue at JPMorgan was down 58 per cent at $1.5bn, compared with analysts’ estimates for $1.6bn, because of the continued dealmaking slowdown.  Revenues in JPMorgan’s trading division, which has benefited from heavy activity during the recent market volatility, increased 7 per cent to $5.7bn. Analysts had forecast revenue to be $5.88bn.","13.01.2023"
"Credit crisis surges to top of investors’ list of worries","Bank of America fund manager survey shows inflation is no longer seen as biggest risk to markets ","The threat of a credit crisis that creates damaging shockwaves across the global financial system has overtaken inflation as investors’ biggest worry in the wake of a spate of US bank collapses. Almost a third of fund managers highlighted a “systemic credit event” as the biggest risk to markets, according to Bank of America’s closely watched monthly survey, which canvassed the views of investors overseeing a combined $621bn of assets. The survey was carried out in the wake of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but before the Swiss government forced through a takeover by UBS to rescue ailing lender Credit Suisse. The troubles in the US banking system sparked an investor stampede out of the sector, which until February had been among the most favoured by global asset managers. Fund managers moved to a net 3 per cent underweight in the US bank sector, a drop of 22 percentage points since last month.    “Contagion risks across US regional banks drove investors out of the US bank sector this month at the fastest pace since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofA global research. The KBW bank index, a broad US banking benchmark, has dropped 27 per cent since the start of February.  The shift in investor sentiment echoes comments by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who earlier this month warned about the risk of a “slow rolling crisis” in the US financial system “with more seizures and shutdowns” following SVB’s failure. Investors also retreated from the European banking sector during March as the crisis at Credit Suisse intensified after it admitted to “material weaknesses” in internal controls over financial reporting. Saudi National Bank, the biggest CS shareholder, then ruled out providing any more financial assistance in a blunt vote of no confidence in the beleaguered Swiss lender. Just over a third of global fund managers also worry that the most likely source of a systemic crisis lies in the “shadow-banking” sector where less regulated players, such as private credit managers, have grown hugely in size over the past decade and become significant competitors to established banks. Concerns that problems are brewing elsewhere were evident with a net 46 per cent of fund managers describing their perception of counterparty risks as “above normal”, a jump of 25 percentage points since last month to the highest level since the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020.    A net 42 per cent of fund managers also said they expected a global recession this year, the first increase in this measure since November 2022.  “Regardless of whether more financial institutions run into trouble, it is looking increasingly likely that we will see a bigger tightening of credit conditions which will weigh on economic activity,” said Vicky Redwood, a senior adviser at Capital Economics.

"Mega-banks in small states spell danger","There are stark lessons to be drawn from the history of previous lender failures","The writer is author of ‘Seven Crashes’ The operation to rescue Credit Suisse by pushing it into the arms of UBS was flawed and rashly concocted. It did not follow the cumbersomely negotiated model for the resolution of large systemically important financial institutions. It gave an uncanny echo of one of the reddest of red flags in international financial history, the story of the interwar failure of the Vienna Creditanstalt. In 1929, at the outset of the Great Depression, the Austrian government pushed the Creditanstalt, by far the country’s largest bank, to take over the failing second-largest bank, the Bodencreditanstalt. Less than two years later, the Creditanstalt itself failed, and the rippling contagion brought down the German banking system. Ensuing panic then spread to major financial centres, London and New York, and ensured that the Great Depression would be a permanently scarring economic memory. In the Lehman weekend of September 2008, then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke thought immediately of the grim warning provided by the failure of the Creditanstalt.  The Creditanstalt teaches two lessons. First, it is dangerous for any financial institution to take over a problematic bank. Nobody can tell for sure what worms are in the rotten apple. It is easy for nervous depositors and creditors and shareholders to think that the rot may spread further. That is why, in the German crisis of July 1931, following the Creditanstalt collapse, Deutsche Bank refused the government’s plea to take over, or to give a guarantee to, the bankrupt Darmstädter Bank. A merged megabank would have been very vulnerable to a banking run.  The second lesson is that very big banks become an impossible threat if they are in small host countries. The 1931 Creditanstalt rescue required large-scale government funds in the bailout, and the consequent fiscal hole generated a currency crisis. In 2008, small and even medium-sized countries were severely challenged by the cost of banking support. Crises in over-sized banks effectively blew up Ireland and Iceland, and required painful IMF involvement. Even in a larger economy, the HBOS saga cost the British taxpayer dear.  The perception that any bailout today in a small country would be cumbersome, costly and above all uncertain makes for greater nervousness in a world in which investors and depositors are used to shunting large amounts quickly. Small economies should also reflect on what their appeal is. They can be nimble, entrepreneurial, with skills blossoming in a loosely regulated framework. That describes Switzerland — and a substantial number of other small countries — accurately when it comes to the application of smart technologies. For finance however, smartness creates vulnerability not strength — and a mega financial institution is especially fragile. The vulnerability of small countries to the perils of big banking raises an obvious asymmetry. Isn’t it unfair that the United States can get away with this sort of improvised rescue of struggling banks? In 2008, when JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns, it looked plausible that a solid bank might manage the integration of a fallen institution. But that action relied on the backstop of a big federal budget and a central bank with a large balance sheet. The painful fact for the rest of the world is that the US, and perhaps China too, can get away with operations that are too dangerous for small countries. Big finance works only for big players. There may be a case for a single large bank in any country — but then it would have to be exceedingly safe, with a transparent and boring balance sheet. However, it couldn’t be expected to make bold and innovative financial decisions. Risk taking is better left to smaller players, who are free to play the capitalist game, and to take risks without expecting rescues that undermine the basic legitimacy of a market order.  ","19.04.2023"
"Depositors pull nearly $60bn from three US banks as Apple raises pressure","Charles Schwab, State Street and M&T report outflows as savers hunt for better rates","Big US financial groups Charles Schwab, State Street and M&T suffered almost $60bn in combined bank deposit outflows in the first quarter as customers continued to move their money in search of higher returns.  The deposit flight has been turbocharged by the collapse last month of Silicon Valley Bank and two other US lenders, with cash moving out of bank accounts at a pace not seen since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.  In a fresh sign of the threat to traditional banks, Apple and Goldman Sachs on Monday announced the launch of a new savings account in the US that will pay a market-leading 4.15 per cent a year.   US savers have been yanking cash out of low-yielding bank accounts and ploughing it into alternative products such as money market funds or Treasury bills that pay better returns, allowing them to take advantage of the sharp interest rate rises implemented by the Federal Reserve. The average US bank account savings rate is just 0.37 per cent, according to government data, versus the Fed’s benchmark rate of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent.  Schwab on Monday said deposits fell 11 per cent, or $41bn, in the first quarter and 30 per cent year on year to $325.7bn. Custody bank State Street’s total deposits fell 5 per cent in the first quarter to $224bn, more than expected, and the group told analysts that another $4bn to $5bn of outflows of non-interest-bearing deposits could leave in the second quarter.  M&T Bank reported total deposits had declined 3 per cent from $163.5bn at the end of 2022 to $159.1bn. The deposit flows, reported in first-quarter earnings, heralded an anxious start to a week when dozens of regional and midsized banks are due to announce their results, providing a fuller picture of the damage wrought by the failure last month of SVB and the other lenders.  Last week, some of the biggest US banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, announced they had raked in billions of dollars in deposits from customers fleeing smaller lenders following SVB’s collapse.  State Street’s shares closed down more than 9 per cent in New York after quarterly profits missed expectations and fees were hit by reduced assets under management in its investment arm.   Ron O’Hanley, State Street chief executive, said the sharp declines in the bank’s shares “show the sensitivity among investors [because] there was so much volatility” around deposits. Meanwhile, Schwab reported better than expected profits but paused share buybacks.  Rates have risen so quickly that Schwab’s traditionally staid customer base of retail investors moved cash from its bank — which pays only 0.45 per cent interest on cash — at a clip that caught it off guard and caused it to borrow at a high cost to cover the outflows.  “We’re not oblivious,” said Walt Bettinger, Schwab’s chief executive. “We know that we have driven much of what has gone on that has affected our near-term earnings.” While its bank deposits declined, the size of Schwab’s money market funds increased 150 per cent to $358bn from $143bn in the first quarter of 2022, and is up almost 30 per cent from the end of last year. UBS analyst Brennan Hawken wrote that the Schwab results were “not as ugly as feared”. Shares in the broker closed up almost 4 per cent.  M&T, a Buffalo, New York-based lender did better than analysts had expected on net interest income, the gap between what it pays for deposits and charges for loans. Its shares rose almost 8 per cent.  Additional reporting by Kate Duguid in London, Joshua Franklin in New York and Patrick McGee in San Francisco ","17.04.2023"
"EU ban on forever chemicals would hit bloc’s green transition, warns top industry boss","Chemours chief joins chipmakers in publicly pushing back against bloc’s proposal to restrict use of PFAS variants","Europe will sabotage its chances of developing a green economy if it pushes ahead with proposals to ban so-called forever chemicals on health and safety grounds, the chief executive of one of the world’s leading chemical companies has warned. Mark Newman, head of Delaware-based Chemours, said “the race to decarbonise through hydrogen is going to be thwarted” if the EU decided to ban a class of high-performance, long-lasting fluoropolymers known as PFAS. “You can’t have electric vehicles without fluoropolymers, you can’t have semiconductors,” he added. These synthetic chemicals are used in millions of applications from non-stick cookware to textiles, batteries and smartphones. The chemical industry argues that their strong resistance to water, oil, temperature and corrosion makes them indispensable to many green technologies.  However, the molecules do not break down easily and accumulate over time in humans and in the environment. Studies have linked several variants to slow foetal and baby growth, kidney cancer and other health problems. The substances have been found in the blood of 97 per cent of Americans, according to the US government. Newman is one of the first senior chemicals executives to push back publicly against the EU proposal to restrict the use of all variants of PFAS, roughly 10,000 different chemical compounds.  “It’s really amazing to me that we would think of walking away from a group of chemistries . . . that enables the green economy.” Such a decision would direct investment out of the bloc, and “deindustrialise” Europe, he said.  The ban would be particularly detrimental to Chemours, owner of the Teflon brand and one of the world’s leading PFAS producers. The company derives roughly a quarter of sales and ebitda from the division producing these materials.  The health and environmental risks surrounding the chemicals have meant that chemicals companies are facing a rising tide of litigation. BASF saw an 83 per cent rise in legal cases, while Clariant, the Swiss chemicals company, has been named as a defendant in about 1,000 US PFAS lawsuits, UBS analysts said in a recent note. Spun out of DuPont in 2015, in large part to safeguard the parent company against PFAS liabilities, Chemours is facing several lawsuits in the US over the compounds.   The EU’s proposed ban, led by Germany and the Netherlands, is several years in the making and considered to be the most radical chemical legislation ever proposed.  Last month, the EU opened a six-month consultation on the proposals, while investors have also been calling for an end to the use of the chemicals. Many US states are moving to limit the use of PFAS as well. Newman told the FT he  believed that a ban on all PFAS variants would be “unenforceable . . . Are you going to take apart everything at the border and look for fluoropolymer?”  The prospect of a wholesale ban has sparked deep concern in the semiconductor industry, where fluoropolymers are critical to the manufacture of the most advanced chips.  Newman said that in many cases there was no near-term alternative to these highly resistant compounds. “Are you willing to wait another 20 years for an alternative, when one may not exist?” he said.  Instead it was possible to  manufacture the compounds more safely, preventing emissions of the molecules into the environment, and to dispose of products properly at the end of life, he said.  “We could have a hydrogen [industry] today and manufacture [PFAS] responsibly,” he said.  Chemours has invested $75mn-$100mn every year since 2018 to prevent PFAS emissions into the air and water and would continue that level of spending, Newman said. The company aimed to reduce emissions by 99 per cent before 2030.  Can we take the 'forever' out of forever chemicals? | FT Food Revolution

"EU housing market boom ends with first quarterly price fall since 2015","Prices fall in 15 of the bloc’s 27 member states as rising borrowing costs and tighter lending standards hit demand","House prices in the EU have suffered their first quarterly fall since 2015, as rising borrowing costs bring an end to an almost decade-long boom in residential property markets. Eurostat, the EU’s statistics office, said on Tuesday that house prices dropped 1.5 per cent in the final three months of 2022 after declines in 15 of the bloc’s 27 member countries. The biggest declines were in Denmark and Germany, where house prices fell 6.5 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.  Higher interest rates and the soaring cost of living are deterring many Europeans from buying a house, leading to a sharp drop in demand for mortgages, which is putting downward pressure on property prices.  More recent data published by individual countries indicate the decline is likely to have continued during the opening months of this year. Dutch house prices fell 1.5 per cent between January and February, according to figures from the national statistics agency CBS last month. There were some bright spots, such as Croatia, where rising demand from foreign buyers ahead of the country’s introduction of the euro in January drove house prices up by 4.7 per cent in the final quarter of last year.  But the surge in house prices witnessed over the past decade has now gone into reverse in much of the EU.   While prices remain more than 50 per cent higher than in early 2014, a series of interest rate rises by the European Central Bank and other rate-setters are expected to continue to affect the market.  “We expect a further deterioration in house price momentum in the coming quarters,” said Anja Heimann, an economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, adding that a lack of investment from the construction sector would eventually stabilise prices by limiting supply.  The ECB last month raised its deposit rate by half a percentage point to 3 per cent, taking borrowing costs in the eurozone to their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis and some policymakers have said another rise is likely in May.  Banks have tightened credit conditions in response and analysts think they could retreat further after the turmoil of the past month in the sector, triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and the forced sale of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS. “We are likely to see a further increase in banks’ cost of funding, a tightening of credit standards and a deceleration in the growth of lending volumes,” Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the ECB, said in a speech at the weekend. Total lending by banks to eurozone customers fell for the third consecutive month in February, taking the total three-month decline to €72bn and ending nearly five years of consistent growth, according to figures published by the ECB last week. Sweden’s housing market suffered one of the biggest falls in Europe with prices falling 15 per cent over the past year. This decline continued after Swedish house prices fell 0.8 per cent between February and March, according to data from mortgage lender SBAB Bank on Monday. The UK has also suffered a sharp downturn in its housing market, where prices fell 0.8 per cent between February and March, according to data released by mortgage provider Nationwide last week. That continued an uninterrupted decline in UK house prices since last summer and led to a year-on-year drop of 3.1 per cent, the biggest since 2009.","04.04.2023"
"Global regulators consider wider net to catch smaller US banks","Demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature fuels concerns that existing focus on largest lenders is outdated","Global regulators are considering imposing tougher rules on smaller lenders and requiring all banks to ready themselves for faster runs on deposits as officials search for lessons from the recent turmoil that led to the failure of several midsized US institutions.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets global standards, promised in March to examine whether additional rules were needed in light of a string of recent banking collapses.  No timeframe has been set for the work. But policymakers gathered in Washington for the IMF spring meetings last week told the Financial Times that attention would focus on issues exposed by the demise of Californian institution Silicon Valley Bank.   That could mean forcing medium-sized lenders, such as SVB and the now defunct Signature Bank, to comply with Basel rules on capital and liquidity. While all EU lenders must adhere to the rules, in the US they currently only apply to “internationally active” banks — a group limited to the largest institutions.  Three senior regulators said that the “internationally active” concept was outdated and that policymakers would explore whether the rules should be applied to banks of “international relevance”, or those with potential to destabilise the broader financial system.  The Californian lender’s demise sent tremors across global markets, leading to sharp plunges in the value of bank stocks from Paris to New York. “SVB has shown you don’t have to be internationally active to be able to generate cross-border spillovers,” one senior policymaker said.  While SVB did not have to apply the Basel rule book, when it ran into difficulty the US authorities decided to use a “systemic risk exception” to rescue all of its depositors, even though only sums up to $250,000 were insured.  Officials have also spoken publicly about re-examining rules on bank liquidity, known as the liquidity coverage ratio. Two policymakers said that this could involve requiring banks to be able to withstand much faster bank runs because SVB’s collapse highlighted the dramatic pace at which deposits could flee in a digital era.  Those policymakers, and several others, said that they were looking at the issue of digital deposit runs more generally, and exploring measures to buffet the system from them, although they acknowledged that the work would be challenging.   Policymakers are also considering a more prescriptive approach to how regulators ensure their banks can cope with interest rate changes, after the collapse in the value of SVB’s bond portfolio triggered by interest rate rises torpedoed the bank’s balance sheet and ignited a run on deposits.  “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book” — a measure that looks at things like how interest rate changes affect banks’ cash flow from loans and the value of their bonds — is now assessed as part of the “Pillar 2” capital requirements imposed at supervisors’ discretion.  Several regulators said that there was a case for moving this to the main capital requirements, known as Pillar 1, where there would be less variation among jurisdictions and institutions. The US, which stringently opposed this idea in earlier Basel packages, is expected to protest less vociferously this time around given recent events, two of the people said.  Regulators will also look at whether there is a case for global standards on how government bonds are valued on banks’ books, since banks in the US and Europe invoke different treatments now.  The Financial Stability Board, another regulatory body based in Basel, is separately examining the resolution planning framework because the Swiss authorities deemed Credit Suisse’s living will unworkable when the bank needed a rescue takeover by Swiss rival UBS in March. But policymakers say the resolution regime has value and they do not expect major changes.  The BCBS and the FSB declined to comment.

"Inflation back at the top of the fear list for worrywart investors ","Washington’s deal on borrowing is a rare jolt of good news in a difficult year","And relax. After months of performative wrangling, the showboats of US politics have finally agreed to give the country more leeway in borrowing, a move that extinguishes the risk of a potentially cataclysmic default on its government bonds.  Averting a disaster in the world’s core so-called risk-free asset, this is victory for common sense.  If you are heavily invested in chipmaker Nvidia and other big-name US tech stocks, you are living your best life regardless of this whole pantomime. For everyone else, the deal on the debt ceiling is a rare jolt of good news in a worrywart year, as HSBC summed up nicely this week.   “Recapping the first five months of 2023 reads more like a song list of doom-mongers rather than anything else,” Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at the bank wrote this week. Aside from the US debt ceiling tussle, fund managers have had to contend with a string of US bank failures, alarm over a credit crunch and constant warnings about a horror show in corporate earnings.  Conspicuously, risky markets have kept motoring higher anyway. Sure, US stocks in particular are dominated by a tiny clutch of high-flying names, without which they would be flat this year. Opinion is divided on whether that is, in itself, a cause for alarm. Either way, the S&P 500 has gained about 10 per cent so far in 2023 despite the laundry list of risks and shouty warnings of imminent disaster. Even Kettner, who has been an optimist on risky asset prices all year, is growing nervous this has gone too far. The question now is whether clearing a US default off the agenda clears the way for some punchy new rallies in US and indeed global stocks. The sense is that it is a necessary precondition, but probably not enough on its own.  “The rally needs more,” wrote Mark Haefele, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. “While the prospect of a [debt ceiling] resolution is positive for risk sentiment and may support stocks in the near term, we still think the risk-reward balance for broad US equities remains unfavourable amid other macro challenges.” At the risk of sounding like a broken record, top of that list of macro challenges is, you guessed it, inflation – the corrosive force that chewed up and spat out fund managers last year by hurting both stocks and bonds. Few are keen on a re-run. Evidence that the dreaded i-word is simply not backing down is everywhere. The UK is something of an outlier, of course. But core inflation is proving annoyingly sticky, and food prices are up almost 20 per cent in the past year. Bracing stuff. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve’s favoured inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditure data – is still rattling along. Core PCE was shown earlier this month to be running at 4.7 per cent a year, well above the Fed’s target. The rapid return to low and, crucially, stable inflation, is stubbornly refusing to materialise.  “People talk about the peak in inflation, but they don’t see the next waves coming,” says Frédéric Leroux, head of the cross-asset team at Carmignac in Paris. “We have had the first peak, but there will be a series of them in the coming years.” Too often, he says, investors and analysts infer that the rapid acceleration in price increases after the Covid-era lockdowns had one big fixable source – the shutdown and reopening of global supply chains – and another less fixable one: the war in Ukraine. Instead, broader interlinked forces are at play, from reshoring to the reset in global geopolitics to the green energy transition, all of which point to higher structural inflation for decades to come. “The market is of the view that inflation is transitory,” Leroux says. “It’s not.” For him this bolsters the case for active rather than passive fund management, for tilting away from growth stocks, particularly in the US, and instead towards unloved pockets of value. He is drawn towards Japan, Europe and Asia. “We have this big wave [of investor interest] from west to east,” he says. Michael Saunders, formerly a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee and now a senior policy adviser at Oxford Economics, suggests this may be a little pessimistic. “Inflation will not go away as quickly as it came,” he says. “The ‘immaculate disinflation’ where it shoots up and then shoots down again looks less plausible now. But I believe that central banks will eventually get there. So we won’t have structurally higher inflation, but we will have structurally higher interest rates to make sure it’s not persistent.”  This message is cutting through. Expectations for a cut in US interest rates to soften the blow of stresses in the banking system are now melting away. Futures markets have swung from anticipating that the Fed’s next move will deliver welcome relief with a cut, to baking in a roughly one-in-three chance of a rise. Strip out those high-flying tech stocks and suddenly it looks like those doom-mongers are still cracking out their greatest hits. Inflation remains top of the pops. katie.martin@ft.com ","02.06.2023"
"Ukraine’s plans for Crimea ","Advertisers are increasing their spending on TikTok, despite threats by the US to ban the app ","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Ukraine’s plans for Crimea’ Marc Filippino Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, April 6th, and this is your FT News Briefing.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Ukraine says it sees a path to reopening talks with Russia about Crimea. And KKR is going big on a financial communications group. Plus boardrooms — they have this thing for going back to their exes. But sometimes there’s a reason things didn’t work out the first time. Anjli Raval Often CEO that has gone and is returning is actually coming back to resolve issues that they probably started. Marc Filippino I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.  [MUSIC PLAYING] The US has been threatening to ban TikTok for a while now. There are national security concerns over the social media app: suspicions that its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, uses TikTok to spy on Americans. These US-China tensions haven’t scared brands, though. In fact, digital advertising on TikTok grew by 11 per cent in March. Analytics group Sensor Tower found that companies like Pepsi, Amazon and Apple were some of the biggest spenders on TikTok last month. But not every company is comfortable taking the risk. Some are moving ad spending to other platforms like Meta and Google, just in case the US does actually ban TikTok.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Russia annexed Crimea back in 2014, well before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv is now planning a counteroffensive. And one official tells the FT that if it goes well, Ukraine will be willing to restart talks with Russia about the future of the region. Chris Miller is here to talk more about Crimea and the war in Ukraine. Hi, Chris. Christopher Miller Hey. Marc Filippino Chris, you spoke to someone close to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. His name is Andriy Sybiha and he’s the deputy head of Zelenskyy’s office. He mentioned to you that talks about Crimea could reopen after this counteroffensive, assuming that this counteroffensive is successful. What exactly was he getting at there? Christopher Miller Yeah, you know, I think Andriy was saying that if we manage to recapture enough territory and really to put Vladimir Putin’s forces on the ground in Ukraine on their heels, then at that point, if our military approaches the administrative border of Ukraine, we’re willing to restart talks that Ukraine cut off last spring after these atrocities were revealed in Bucha and in Mariupol, and other, and other cities that Russia had previously occupied. You know, they are growing a little bit concerned about the length of this war, how long it might, it might go on for. And if they can be successful in recapturing a significant amount of territory, then they would move back to a diplomatic track. Marc Filippino This is, I mean, there’s a lot of ifs here, Chris. And obviously, like Ukraine wants to stay optimistic and plan as though success is gonna happen, which makes a ton of sense. But even if they are successful, isn’t there a lot of assuming on the table that Russia would even come back to the table and talk about this? Christopher Miller Putin has said repeatedly that the issue of Crimea, the status of Crimea, is not up for discussion. But I, you know, part of Ukraine’s planning here is that they’ll be so successful in their counter-offensive that they’ll sweep in and take back all of this territory. It’ll be a devastating loss for Russia. And their hope is that they’ll get to the point where Putin will have no other choice but to sit down and to try to negotiate some kind of settlement.  Marc Filippino Would the Ukrainian public view any sort of diplomatic talks as a concession to Russia? Christopher Miller You know, I think any talk involves Crimea not being a part of Ukraine. That is what Ukrainians will see as a red line. And recent polls show almost as much as 90 per cent of Ukrainians are completely against ceding any territory to Russia. Very forthcoming about what he sees here. You know, this is not a negotiation that he’s going to go into where he is willing, I think, to negotiate Crimea away from Ukraine. Marc Filippino Chris Miller is the FT’s Ukraine correspondent. Thanks, Chris. Christopher Miller Thank you.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc Filippino KKR is buying a large stake in the financial communications group FGS Global. Sources tell the FT that the deal could be announced as soon as next week and it would value FGS at around one and a half-billion dollars. FGS is backed by the British media and advertising group WPP. This is just the latest example of a big buyout group making its way into a communications sector that focuses on strategy and crisis advice. KKR, FGS and WPP all declined to comment for the story.  [MUSIC PLAYING] You might notice that companies are bringing back familiar faces to run their business. Disney brought back Bob Iger as CEO last year. Howard Schultz has returned to the head of Starbucks on three different occasions. And last week, UBS tapped former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the bank as it acquires rival Credit Suisse. Our management editor, Anjli Raval, has written about these boomerang CEOs as they’re called. Hi, Anjli. Anjli Raval Hi. Marc Filippino First of all, clever name. Boomerang CEOs. I love it. Anjli Raval Yeah. I mean, this is sort of management speak, really. It’s sort of used largely in the US because this is a largely US phenomenon. They’re also known as bounce back CEOs over here in the UK. Marc Filippino Why are companies doing this? Why are they bringing back former CEOs? Anjli Raval Fundamentally, it’s about a search for safety. People, and I say, people. I mean, boards, top company executives. They like the familiar in a time of crisis. They know these people. Often these people are the ones that hired them many moons ago. At the same time, they understand corporate culture. They’re not starting from scratch. They have an idea of what’s going on. Marc Filippino So you recently spoke to Chris Bingham, a professor at the University of North Carolina, who researched how well these boomerang CEOs shake out. What did he find? Anjli Raval He actually found that the second time round they don’t perform as well. And largely that is because the business environment has changed. I mean, just look at the last two years alone. So Ermotti’s coming back to UBS after only two years, but only two years means the entire Covid pandemic, a war in Ukraine. You’ve got, you know, inflation. You’ve got issues all over the world, big geopolitical crises, big economic crises. And this is what he’s coming back to. Marc Filippino So what’s your big takeaway here, Anjali? Anjli Raval The interesting thing here is it’s actually not about the individual themselves who’s coming back. Obviously on the surface, it looks like they’re complete heroes. But more than anything else, it probably shows that there’s been a failure in succession planning for most of these companies. Often CEO that has gone and is returning is actually coming back to resolve issues that they probably started. And so it shows that not only have these particular CEOs not done their job in terms of finding appropriate successors, but the boards are then not holding the outgoing CEO to account and trying to plan for the future.

"Global anti-money laundering fines surge 50%","New data fuels doubts over effectiveness of crackdown on financial crime since 2008 crisis","Global fines for failing to prevent money laundering and other financial crime surged more than 50 per cent last year, fuelling warnings that such penalties are not curbing the behaviour and systems flaws that allow criminals to channel money through the global financial system.  Banks and other financial institutions were fined almost $5bn for “anti-money laundering” infractions, breaching sanctions and failings in their “know your customer” systems in 2022, bringing the total since the global financial crisis to almost $55bn, data from compliance firm Fenergo shows.  Fines typically come several years after infractions, so the latest figures do not capture financial institutions caught offside by the glut of sanctions introduced in the wake of Russia’s assault on Ukraine last year.   The 2022 surge marks a rebound from a fall the previous year, raising questions over the effectiveness of a global crackdown on financial crime in the wake of the 2008 crisis, when authorities started issuing large fines in an effort to compel beleaguered banks to do more to protect the financial system from criminal misuse.   “There’s a lot of evidence, particularly in the UK and the US, in terms of recidivism . . . repeat offending by the big firms after they’ve been fined for things,” said Huw McCartney, a professor at the University of Birmingham and co-author of a 2019 study of the impact of post-crisis fines on the Anglo-American banking markets.  McCartney said that in the wake of fines, companies usually put more resources into compliance and monitoring but remediations could be “quite poorly enforced and monitored both within the firm and by the regulators themselves”.  The US has been the most aggressive imposer of penalties, chalking up $37bn of the fines, followed by roughly $11bn in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and just over $5.1bn in Asia-Pacific, according to the Fenergo data.   Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Washington-based financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, is also sceptical of the effectiveness of fines in cleaning up the financial system.  “No matter how big the fines are they don’t punish and they don’t deter,” he said, adding that the penalties are “mostly a meaningless cost of doing business. No matter how big they are they are small compared to the revenue and profits of the banks.”  He believes that personal accountability would be more effective. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the way to punish a banker is to take away his or her money,” he said. BNP Paribas, UBS, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and Standard Chartered top the league table for AML and related fines in the post-crisis era.  BNP, UBS, Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.  Standard Chartered said it saw “fighting financial crime as an ongoing process of improvement and will continue to invest in our people, systems and processes”. HSBC said it was “deeply committed to combating financial crime and protecting the integrity of the global financial system” and had made “significant investments” to bolster its financial crime and compliance capabilities.  Stuart Graham, London-based banks analyst at Autonomous, said the fines had been “manageable” for the financial industry as a whole.  “For some individual banks, however, most notably Danske or Swedbank, resolving AML/KYC legacy problems has been all-consuming for management teams,” he added. “In addition to the fines, it has involved costly remediation plans and distracted management teams from growing the ordinary business.”  He disputed Kelleher’s contention that fines were seen as a cost of doing business and said investors’ “tolerance of banks’ AML shortcomings is very low nowadays”. Some ESG-focused investors would view errant financial institutions as “uninvestable”.  “Cutting corners on AML/KYC processes just makes no economic sense when the fines, remediation costs and reputational damage can be so high,” he said.  Roger McCormick, who worked on a long-running project on conduct costs at the Bayes Business School, said banks now had a more “genuine desire to do the right thing” but that given the time lag between failings and fines, “the extent to which banks are behaving now” may only be seen in future years.","19.01.2023"

A surprise jump in UK inflation to 10.4 per cent in February has fuelled concerns about the cost of living crisis and reinforced expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates tomorrow.  The increase, from 10.1 per cent the previous month, was driven by an 18.2 per cent rise in food and non-alcoholic drink prices, the highest pace in more than 45 years. Core inflation, which strips out food and other volatile items such as energy, also rose more than expected, from 5.8 per cent to 6.2 per cent. Soaring food prices are especially bad news for poorer households as they make up a greater proportion of their spending. The opposition Labour party accused the government of having its priorities wrong, preferring a “£1bn bung” for the top 1 per cent in its recent Budget, rather than doing more to alleviate pressures on those at the bottom. Food prices have been pushed up by a range of factors. Britain’s farmers have been struggling with rising input costs on everything from fuel to animal feed, while they have also lost income because of Brexit, as new UK support failed to match previous EU payments. February saw a rise in salad vegetable costs and shortages at supermarkets because of supply chain problems as well as adverse weather conditions in Spain and Morocco. Farmers are also still suffering from post-Brexit labour shortages. Energy prices, which had been the main driver of the surge in inflation, are now falling, but remain higher than in the US and the eurozone. Like other central banks, the BoE is faced with the task of raising rates to restrain inflation against a backdrop of turbulence in the banking sector. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told parliament yesterday that the BoE should remain focused on the inflationary threat even as he acknowledged that recent rate rises were the “root cause of the volatility we have seen in recent months”.  Markets are now predicting an increase of 0.25 percentage points tomorrow, with some even pricing in a rise of 0.50 points. Before today’s data, investors were evenly split between forecasting a quarter point rise and no change.   Although the UK has the highest inflation in the G7, it is not alone in struggling to turn the tide. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde warned today of the risk of a “tit-for-tat dynamic” between companies and workers as demands for higher wages increased price pressures. Lagarde said recent ECB rate rises were only starting to take effect and needed to continue to “bring rates to sufficiently restrictive levels” to damp demand.   Her comments echo those of Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel, who said rate-setters must be “more stubborn” in their fight against inflation.

"US stocks jump as investors bet on slowing interest rates","Fall in producer prices fuel hopes Federal Reserve will wrap up its tightening campaign","US stocks advanced on Thursday after cooler than expected inflation data boosted traders’ hopes that the Federal Reserve could tap the brakes on its tightening cycle. The blue-chip S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent in New York, closing at its highest level since February 15. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.9 per cent. Traders were encouraged by data showing a cooling of the US economy, as the producer price index for final demand unexpectedly fell 0.5 per cent in March, which could signal relief for consumers who have had higher operating costs passed on to them. New jobless claims data showed the number of people filing for unemployment benefits climbed more than expected to 239,000.  “There’s a lag in terms of the employment data because of how it is calculated by law when people are laid off,” said Steven Blitz, chief US economist at TS Lombard. “This might well be the first shot across the bow, the unemployment rate will start climbing faster than people are expecting, and once that happens the Federal Reserve will start cutting [interest rates].” Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in March, published on Wednesday, showed officials predicting a “mild recession” starting later this year, before the economy recovers over the next two years. The yield on two-year Treasuries was flat at 3.97 per cent and 10-year notes increased 0.04 percentage points to 3.45 per cent. Yields move inversely to prices. “With the US economy cooling and a Fed pivot not imminent, we believe the environment for equities will remain challenging in the coming months,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. Investors are weighing the effect of the data and the prospect of the economy shrinking as policymakers ready to meet next month to determine whether to plough ahead with another rate rise or pause tightening. Markets appear to have grown more confident that falling inflation will persuade the Fed to moderate the pace of interest rate rises to combat consumer price pressures. Swaps markets predict a 70 per cent chance of a 0.25 percentage point increase over no change, according to data from Refinitiv.  The euro rose 0.5 per cent to its highest level in a year against the dollar. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six peer currencies, fell 0.5 per cent to its lowest level since February.  In Europe, investors are pricing in a more hawkish path from the European Central Bank, with nearly a two-in-three chance of a 0.25 percentage point rise and roughly a one in three chance of a larger half-point increase. ECB governing council member Robert Holzmann said on Wednesday that the central bank should raise rates by 0.5 percentage points because the “danger of currently doing too little and to fan inflation is bigger than the risk of doing too much”. European industrial production data released on Thursday was higher than forecasts at 1.5 per cent, a half percentage point more than the previous month. German 10-year Bund yields rose slightly to 2.38 per cent. Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 closed up 0.4 per cent, London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent and Germany’s Dax was up 0.2 per cent. France’s Cac 40 was the standout, rising 1.1 per cent as strong earnings from LVMH boosted demand for luxury stocks. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed up 0.2 per cent and China’s CSI 300 was down 0.7 per cent.  International oil benchmark Brent crude and US equivalent West Texas fell 1.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively, after both gaining more than 2 per cent on Wednesday.","13.04.2023"
"The fast-growing kingdom of Jamie Dimon","The question now is whether JPMorgan is too big for its own good","His ears are smaller. And there is no crown. But on Wall Street, at least, Jamie Dimon is America’s answer to King Charles III — adulated by some, resented by others, but incontrovertibly powerful. Days before the British monarch’s coronation, Dimon cemented his royal status in finance with another landmark deal for JPMorgan Chase, the bank he has led since 2005. With the state-orchestrated takeover of the failing First Republic, JPMorgan has swelled to three times its size before the 2008 financial crisis, and now commands an asset base of nearly $4tn.  The First Republic takeover is reminiscent of two larger crisis-triggered rescue deals from 2008, when policymakers worked with Dimon to facilitate JPMorgan’s purchase of the failing Bear Stearns investment bank and Washington Mutual, a troubled commercial lender. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which manages US bank failures and administered the First Republic transaction, made clear JPMorgan had won the deal ahead of other bidders, essentially thanks to its heft. It could afford to offer a better value package to the FDIC — and the organisation has a legal duty to choose the “least-cost” solution. But this is a self-perpetuating argument, and with the banking turbulence of recent months turning into a full-blown regional banks crisis, JPMorgan could well become the natural buyer of other troubled banks. That feels neither healthy nor sustainable. Respecting the “least-cost” law, without considering the longer-term bigger picture, is myopic. Not that the short-term picture is cloudless. The febrile financial mood of recent months has so far proven helpful to big banks, which command greater trust from depositors and equity investors. But theoretically at least, instability could spread beyond the weaker regional banks — especially if the looming US government debt ceiling leads to louder, if implausible, suggestions of a default. In that kind of bleak scenario, the bigger the bank the greater the problem. Relative to the systemic risk big banks pose to their home countries elsewhere in the world, JPMorgan is actually modestly sized. Its assets are less than 17 per cent of US gross domestic product. The bank would have to rescue another 102 First Republics to even match US GDP (or 234 of them to get to twice-GDP, UBS’s size relative to the Swiss economy after its rescue of Credit Suisse). In market share terms, too, JPMorgan looks modest by international standards, with a domestic deposit share of less than 15 per cent, half that of UBS, post-Credit Suisse.  In an absolute sense, though, JPMorgan is vast and unparalleled in the western world. (Only China’s big four lenders outweigh it in assets.) And with critics voicing their opposition to its go-to status for the FDIC, there is a chance that the bank is forced to meet tougher regulatory standards. It already has an unusually high core equity tier one capital ratio — a crucial measure of financial strength — in large part because it is subject to the highest capital surcharge of any global systemically important bank. That surcharge could go higher still, some analysts believe, offsetting the financial benefit of its growing scale. Which brings us to the question of whether JPMorgan benefits from such deals. Looking back at its (far bigger) 2008 acquisitions yields a mixed conclusion. Although they bolstered business in certain areas, the acquired businesses also accounted for the majority of the $19bn of legal costs and penalties that it ended up paying, largely related to legacy mortgage misdemeanours. (The experience prompted Dimon to pledge that he would “not do something like Bear Stearns again”.) However good or bad these kinds of transaction prove for JPMorgan, it is clear that they create an ever bigger bank that becomes ever more challenging to handle. One reason for Dimon’s quasi-regal status is that he has a consistent record of rising to that challenge — with the obvious exceptions of the $6.2bn London Whale trading scandal and the bank’s odd allegiance to former client and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, related to which Dimon himself is being deposed this month. But if there are doubts about the 67-year-old’s ability to run an increasingly large and complex bank, there are many more about the (unknown) heir to his throne. Even without that succession risk, the US authorities should be weighing an urgent question: is JPMorgan just too big: too big to fail, too big to manage, or as the FDIC seems to think, too big to manage without? patrick.jenkins@ft.com","08.05.2023"
"Standard Chartered earnings improve as rising rates and China reopening boost lender","UK-based bank reports $1.8bn of statutory profits before tax in first quarter","Standard Chartered reported better than expected first-quarter results as higher global interest rates and China’s reopening after years of coronavirus-related lockdowns boosted the emerging-markets lender. Pre-tax profit increased 21 per cent to $1.8bn in the first three months of the year, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.4bn, the London-based bank said on Wednesday. Revenue increased 8 per cent to $4.4bn driven by higher net interest income, as lending margins improved alongside higher central bank rates. The numbers were also flattered by a much lower level of loan-loss provisions than expected.  “China reopening is obviously good for us . . . we are encouraged that momentum is picking up,” said chief financial officer Andy Halford. “Bit by bit, relaxing borders has increased activity. We’ve seen more account openings. Overall growth in the Hong Kong business is very strong, as are other parts of Asia.” StanChart upgraded its guidance this year to forecast a 10 per cent growth in income and made a return on tangible equity, a measure of profitability, of 11.9 per cent. The bank’s pre-tax profits in Asia rose 63 per cent, while its business in Europe and the Americas swung to an $18mn loss. Although StanChart is based in the UK, it makes most of its profits in Asia, particularly Hong Kong and Singapore. The shares swung between gains and losses after the release but are up more than 29 per cent in the past year. However, the bank still trades at a steep discount to the book value of its assets and has a market value of $22bn. StanChart has been subject to takeover rumours after First Abu Dhabi Bank said in January that it had considered a bid for the London-listed bank but was no longer pursuing it. UK takeover rules prevent FAB from making an offer before July, but people close to the Middle-Eastern lender have told the Financial Times that it could revive a deal after that date.  The potential move places pressure on chief executive Bill Winters, now in his eighth year in charge. When the bank reported full-year earnings in February, he unveiled a series of shareholder-friendly initiatives, pledging to buy back $5bn of stock by 2024 and said StanChart was “very happy to be here accomplishing our mission all by ourselves”. Winters said on Wednesday the first-quarter performance “has been achieved in what continues to be an uncertain environment” and claimed the earnings represented the highest quarterly figure since the start of 2014. Banks have endured a tumultuous 2023 so far after the Swiss government orchestrated a rescue of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS and Silicon Valley Bank along with several regional US lenders collapsed. Winters said last month that those failures had “very profound implications . . . for the way banks manage themselves” since the failed lenders “would appear to have been solvent” in the post-financial crisis regulatory framework. He stressed that StanChart was “highly liquid and strongly capitalised” and that customer deposits had been stable despite what it described as “recent banking stress”. There are “no signs of deposit outflow, which will be reassuring given recent broader market concerns”, said Aman Rakkar, analyst at Barclays. “Overall, [the quarter was] reassuring but not a lot to change our view. Potential bid interest, solid capital returns and attractive valuation are all supportive.”  Halford flagged improvements in its wealth management business after a slow end to 2022 and said the bank was picking up customers and assets from Credit Suisse, which reported $69bn of outflows in the first quarter after losing more than $100bn late last year. SC Ventures, the venture capital business set up by the bank in 2018, reported a $103mn loss, worse than the $77mn it lost in the same period last year. Halford said the bank “needs to show patience” with its fledgling digital banks Mox and Trust but added that within two to three years, they needed to be able to show they could break even.","26.04.2023"
"The regulators eating humble pie","Current banking wobbles make a mockery of claims that government-funded rescues were a thing of the past","This article is an on-site version of our Swamp Notes newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Monday and Friday Hello from New York. I’m Brooke Masters, the US Financial Editor, filling in for Rana, and I am having 2008 flashbacks. We’ve seen massive share price falls for lenders on both sides of the Atlantic, and the US and Swiss governments have had to step up to provide support to their banking systems. There should be a lot of people eating humble pie right now. The current banking wobbles are making a mockery of the claims that the huge regulatory changes that were imposed post-2008 have made government-funded rescues a thing of the past. For the Americans, the problem stems from their insistence that they had the ability to determine in advance which banks would matter in a crisis. After 2008, the major economies signed up to the tougher rules on bank capital, liquidity and resolution that were hammered out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. But the US opted to impose them only on its biggest banks, while the Europeans made the requirements universal.  I covered the debate at the time and heard endless gossip about fights over the rules for inflicting losses on bank shareholders and bondholders in case of a failure. When European regulators worried that the rules were too tight, US officials argued that the EU should just exempt smaller banks that would struggle to meet tough global standards. But the Europeans, particularly after the eurozone debt crisis, worried that it was too hard to draw a line between the banks that mattered and those that didn’t. Now the chickens have come home to roost for the US. Regulators last week declared that Silicon Valley Bank, which had been exempted from some of the toughest rules because of its size, was nonetheless systemic. That allowed the US government to backstop all of its deposits, even the very large ones.  European regulators, tired of being lectured for being “soft” over earlier small bank rescues, were quick to criticise the “total and utter incompetence” of American authorities. But before they could revel in their schadenfreude, the European banking sector was faced with a crisis of its own. Over the weekend, Swiss authorities had to engineer a rescue of Credit Suisse, which saw its share price drop by more than two-thirds as it suffered a series of scandals. Once the healthier of the two giant Swiss lenders, it was sold to rival UBS for just $3.25bn on Sunday. In a change from the 2008 rescues, the Swiss did wipe out some CS bondholders, but taxpayers could still be on the hook if UBS ends up taking really big losses on some CS assets. While Switzerland is not a member of the EU and has gone its own way on many bank safety rules, CS’s troubles have huge contagion risks — witness last week’s slide in French bank stocks. And CS, unlike SVB, was genuinely a global bank with a substantial US presence.  Stabilising the banking sector will require regulatory authorities to co-ordinate across borders at a time when the urge to point fingers is running high. The fact that European, British and American regulators worked with the Swiss on CS and issued statements welcoming the sale is a good start.  Once the immediate crisis has passed, the big question will be whether we can plug the holes that rapidly rising interest rates have uncovered in our banking system. That almost certainly will require the co-operation of lawmakers as well as regulators. After all, it was a 2018 US law change that ultimately led to looser regulation for banks of SVB’s size. I personally think that the solution may lie in a tiered system of regulation. It would acknowledge that almost any lender can be systemic and set some basic global requirements, but then also set tougher standards for the big guys. Ed, you’re much better on the Washington political scene than I will ever be. Do you think our deeply divided Congress can find any common ground on financial regulation?  Recommended reading As a regulation and white collar crime junkie, I was fascinated by this ProPublica article on corporate CEOs who made a boodle by trading in the shares of companies that were close competitors of the companies they ran. It draws on leaked tax data from an anonymous source and raises questions about what constitutes insider trading.I find the ongoing debate about the source of Covid-19 really fascinating. The latest salvo comes from scientists who draw on evidence tying Covid’s origins to raccoon dogs sold at Wuhan’s wet markets, rather than a Chinese government laboratory.Regulators aren’t the only ones left in a bind by SVB’s demise. This brilliant FT Big Read explains why the bank’s rescue is forcing the tech sector to rethink its attitude towards the government. Rana Foroohar will return later this week. Edward Luce  That’s a tough question, Brooke. It strikes me that there are two responses to this recent flurry of midsize US bank failures. The first is that corrective legislation is needed — perhaps to lower the threshold at which banks are treated as systemic. The second is about the quality of regulators.  You can pass all the bills you want but if regulators do not have the resources to do their jobs well, fine statutes will amount to nothing. I was thinking about the latter as I read this entertainingly contentious New Yorker interview with Barney Frank, the co-author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial legislation, who is on the board of the recently shut down Signature Bank. Frank admitted that he needed the money and hit back angrily at any suggestion it was improper: “If I ruled as off-limits anything I’d worked on when I was in Congress, I guess I’d be a monk,” he said. We can debate that one — Elizabeth Warren would undoubtedly disagree with Frank. But I like his point that it would be better to have bad laws and good regulators than the other way round.   Will there be enough bipartisan consensus to pass a new bill? Possibly. I fear, though, that conservatives have backed themselves into such an outlandish cultural theory of the SVB crisis that any resulting law would be festooned with irrelevancies that might force Joe Biden to veto it. The idea that SVB went under because it was too woke, and spent too much time building a diversified board, has quickly taken hold as conservative lore. At best this theory is wrong. But it gives a flavour of the degree to which all US politics is being subsumed by the culture war, including bank regulation.  Your feedback  And now a word from our Swampians . . .

"Switzerland presses ahead with interest rate rise despite banking crisis","Central bank efforts have ‘put a halt’ to country’s financial turmoil, says governor Thomas Jordan","Switzerland has raised interest rates by half a percentage point, despite the financial turmoil that this week led to a rescue-takeover of one of the country’s largest lenders.  The Swiss National Bank opted to plough ahead with its fourth consecutive interest rate rise, saying the chances of inflation becoming entrenched had risen. It follows a half-point rise by the European Central Bank last week.  Inflation in Switzerland, at 3.4 per cent in February, remains far lower than elsewhere in Europe. But the SNB said it was concerned about upward price pressures becoming entrenched even as the global economy stagnates.  It now expects inflation of 2.6 per cent in 2023 and 2 per cent in 2024 and 2025. The central bank targets inflation of below 2 per cent.  “Ensuring price stability is and will remain the core objective of the SNB,” central bank chief Thomas Jordan said following the decision, which leaves the policy rate at 1.5 per cent.  Jordan spent last weekend brokering discussions between Credit Suisse and UBS, which was forced by the authorities to launch a rescue-takeover of its Swiss rival.  “Our monetary policy assessment has taken place in an exceptional situation,” Jordan said, referring to the near-collapse of Credit Suisse, adding that the SNB’s efforts had “put a halt” to the crisis in Switzerland.  Analysts expect further rises. “Without the turmoil, the SNB may have accelerated the rate hike cycle . . . In the circumstances, a steady pace was probably safer, but significantly more is needed,” said Christian Schulz, economist at Citi. “The economy is resilient, probably also to the domestic financial turmoil, so we expect 50 basis points in June and another 50 basis points at the remaining meetings this year.” Others disagreed with Jordan’s view that the banking turmoil had been contained, saying there were likely to be economic repercussions.  “There is little doubt that fears about financial stability will have an impact on the availability of credit and thus on the economic situation and the inflation environment in the coming months, which will ultimately influence the path of interest rates,” said Charlotte de Montpellier, senior economist at Credit Suisse.  Norges Bank, the first leading western central bank to start tightening monetary policy after the Covid-19 pandemic, also raised rates on Thursday, warning that more increases were to come despite the recent financial upheaval. Norway’s central bank increased borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points to 3 per cent and suggested they would go higher at its next meeting as it tries to bring inflation under control. “There is considerable uncertainty about future economic developments, but if developments turn out as we now expect, the policy rate will be raised further in May,” said Norges Bank governor Ida Wolden Bache. The Bank of England also raised rates by a quarter point, leaving the benchmark bank rate at 4.25 per cent.  The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lift the federal funds rate by a quarter point to a target range of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent, the highest level since 2007.

"Global financial regulator calls for tougher rules after bank panic","FSB chair says rising interest rates, volatility and tight liquidity mean ‘more challenging’ outlook ","The global finance system’s top regulator has urged officials to “learn lessons” from the recent banking turmoil, saying the latest stresses were a reminder that financial stability is “not merely an abstract concept”.  Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board, wrote in a letter published on Wednesday that the need to tighten rules in response to the panic was “all the greater” because, unlike other recent shocks to the global economy, such as the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic, “this latest episode had its origins within the financial system”.  Knot, who is also president of the Dutch central bank, called out “bank prudential and resolution frameworks” as one area of policy work, without giving further details.   Pablo Hernández de Cos, chair of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision which sets the global banking rule book, said changes to liquidity requirements would be an area in focus as the committee “considers the implications of recent events”, but stressed that regulation alone was not the answer.  “The boards and management of banks should be the first port of call in managing and overseeing risks; these functions cannot be outsourced to supervisors,” said Hernández, who is also governor of the Bank of Spain, in a speech on Thursday.  The comments from two of the most influential voices in financial regulation follow the rescue and takeover of Credit Suisse on March 19, the first time an institution subject to the highest level of capital requirements has gone bust since the global financial crisis.  Concerns over the stability of US regional banks increased following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which revealed gaping holes in how US lenders with less than $250bn in assets are overseen. Officials needed to “remain vigilant” as rising interest rates, market volatility and tighter liquidity had triggered a “more challenging” outlook, said Knot. It was “essential for the smooth provision of credit, payment and other financial services to the economy” for finance ministers and governors to take the risks to financial stability seriously.  Hernández said that while tighter liquidity rules would not be enough to prevent “future bank stresses”, they would help “reduce the likelihood and impact of such events”. The Basel committee boss also hinted at a stricter approach to how global banking rules are applied, stressing that its guidance around “proportionate” regulation for smaller banks should mean “more conservative” constraints for that group.   The US exempted small and midsized banks from global standards under the Trump administration, a move that was seen as a key contributor to SVB’s collapse. Financial regulation is a key focus of central bank governors and finance ministers as they gather at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington this week.  Resolution frameworks, which allow banks to be wound down with minimal disruption and without bailouts, were one of the key policy tools developed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  However, Switzerland chose not to use Credit Suisse’s internationally agreed plan when the bank ran into difficulty, instead orchestrating a shotgun marriage with Swiss rival UBS. While SVB was not covered by resolution, the US’s decision to guarantee deposits above the $250,000 level covered by a federal scheme flew in the face of post-crisis policies on how to handle failing banks, prompting outrage from some foreign regulators.  Knot defended the post-crisis reforms, claiming that without those measures “the stress faced by individual banks could have led to broader contagion within the financial system”.  “Still individual institutions can fail, particularly when weaker business models and risk management capabilities are exposed, as they were recently by tighter financial conditions and liquidity challenges,” he added.   Knot also stressed that while recent events could lead to some “reprioritisation” of the FSB’s work, it was “committed” to projects already in train around crypto regulation, shadow banking, climate change and cross-border payments.

"The fragile global economy","World Bank and IMF meetings must tackle financial and climate risks","Over the past three years the global economy has been subjected to an unprecedented series of shocks. After the pandemic struck, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought added disruption. Both contributed to a cost of living crisis, with central banks raising interest rates rapidly to contain runaway inflation. Arguably, the international economic system has displayed remarkable resilience. The most downbeat forecasts for a widescale financial crisis and a chain of debt defaults by low income countries has been avoided so far. But the global economy is badly scarred. The IMF projects the weakest global medium-term growth prospects for over 30 years. Policymakers gathering at the World Bank/IMF spring meetings this week have their work cut out to stabilise the global economy and shift it on to a higher growth path. The IMF forecasts global growth to be 2.8 per cent this year, down slightly on expectations in January. It also places a 25 per cent chance that growth could fall below 2 per cent. Indeed, price pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated and economic conditions have become more fragile. A top official at the IMF warned of “acute” risks to the global financial system, and many advanced economies are expected to be sluggish this year, as high interest rates squeeze credit. Getting the global economy back on track will mean grappling with several pressing risks. Although some calm has returned to the banking system following the collapse of three US banks and Credit Suisse’s emergency takeover by UBS in March, financial markets remain on shaky ground. Central banks can see the end of this rate hiking cycle, but the rapid reversal of a decade of cheap money is exposing vulnerabilities. There are concerns over the impact of high interest rates on commercial real estate and the non-bank sector. Central bankers face a balancing act: they must limit further instability and ensure high inflation does not become entrenched.  At the same time higher borrowing costs are hitting developing countries that have amassed enormous debts dealing with the pandemic and high food and energy prices, exacerbated by a strong dollar. Around 60 per cent of low-income countries are at high risk of or already in debt distress. The poorest countries also face the largest bills for servicing foreign debts in 25 years.  High debt burdens complicate the task for developing countries which need over $2tn a year by 2030 to cut emissions and deal with damage from climate change. Boosting efforts to tackle global warming is paramount to prevent people in poor countries falling deeper into poverty, and to drive growth and job creation. Geopolitical risks are also undermining global prospects. The IMF finds that the long-term cost of trade fragmentation, as a result of tensions between the US and China, could be around 7 per cent of global GDP. Barriers to trade, investment and technology transfer would limit growth, particularly in poorer countries. Policymakers will need to mitigate these risks. Regulators will have to remain vigilant to the knock-on impacts of high interest rates; the recent banking crisis also ought to be a wake-up call to improve bank and non-bank regulation. There is hope that progress on a framework to restructure developing world debt in an orderly manner across creditors, including China, is possible at the meetings. Efforts to mobilise more financing for climate change from international financial institutions, both through more efficient use of their balance sheets and via private sector partnerships are vital too. The complex and connected challenges facing countries require an ambitious and co-operative global response. This week’s meetings are a crucial moment to set that in motion.","11.04.2023"
"Yen slides as new Bank of Japan governor sticks to ultra-loose policy","Kazuo Ueda says negative interest rates and yield curve control remain appropriate for now","The yen fell on Monday after new Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda signalled he would for the time being stick to the ultra-loose monetary policy overseen by his predecessor over the past decade. In his first news conference as head of the BoJ, the 71-year-old economist stressed that the two pillars of Japan’s current monetary policy — negative interest rates and yield curve control — remained appropriate under current economic conditions. Ueda, professor emeritus of the University of Tokyo with a PhD in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, became the first academic to take the helm of the BoJ after he took over from Haruhiko Kuroda on Sunday.  The change in leadership came as investor expectations had been building that Ueda would respond to the highest inflation rate for four decades by gradually pivoting away from Kuroda’s policy of capping long-term government borrowing costs. Ahead of his first monetary policy board meeting later this month, markets had focused on how quickly the new BoJ governor would move to revise or abandon its policy of buying as many bonds as needed to keep 10-year bond yields close to zero. But Ueda signalled the purchases would continue. “In light of the current economic, price and financial conditions, it is appropriate to maintain the yield curve control for now,” he said. The comments sent the yen down as much as 1 per cent to ¥133.4 per US dollar. The currency remains well above the 30-year low of more than ¥150 it hit last year as a growing gulf between Japan’s rock-bottom interest rates and those elsewhere in the developed world hammered the currency. It rebounded in December after the BoJ said it would allow 10-year Japanese government bond yields to fluctuate by 0.5 percentage points above or below its target of zero, relaxing the previous band of 0.25 percentage points. It has since gained further as investors bet that US interest rates are close to peaking. Even so, investors have continued to challenge the central bank to bow to global inflationary pressures and relax the yield ceiling further, or even scrap it.  While the BoJ remained the last major central bank to maintain negative interest rates as its global peers tightened policy to rein in inflation, Ueda also expressed support for the policy, noting that Japan needed to move closer towards sustainably achieving its 2 per cent inflation target.  Japan’s core consumer price index, excluding fresh food prices, rose at a rate of 4.2 per cent in January but has since slowed to 3.1 per cent in February after government subsidies to curb electricity and gas prices kicked in.  The BoJ has argued that easing measures are needed to support the economy since the country’s inflation is not driven by underlying strong consumer demand and will slow as the cost of imported commodities falls. The news conference came shortly after Ueda met Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. According to Ueda, they agreed there was no need for now to revise an existing accord between the government and the central bank, which commits the BoJ to achieving the inflation target “at the earliest date possible”. Asked whether the BoJ’s inflation target would be achievable during his five-year term, Ueda pointed to the robust outcome of this spring’s wage negotiations, which delivered bigger than expected pay rises to workers at large companies.  “We are starting to see positive developments around wages and if this continues, I think there is enough possibility that this would lead to a more stable 2 per cent inflation,” he added.  Turmoil in the global financial markets triggered by the collapse of US lender Silicon Valley Bank and the sale of Credit Suisse to Swiss rival UBS has also complicated the task for the new BoJ governor.  While Ueda said the impact on Japan’s economy and financial system was limited, he warned that “the uncertainty has not gone away completely”. ","10.04.2023"
"Money pulled from eurozone banks at record rate in February ","Outflows indicate difficulties in retaining deposits even before this month’s banking turmoil ","Depositors have withdrawn €214bn from eurozone banks over the past five months, with outflows hitting a record level in February, according to data published by the European Central Bank on Monday. The fall in eurozone bank deposits, which started a few months after the ECB began raising interest rates last summer, marks a reversal from the large amounts of money that had been pouring into banks — particularly since the pandemic. The recent outflows indicate banks were finding it harder to attract and retain depositors even before this month’s turmoil in the banking sector, which caused the collapse of three US lenders and drove Credit Suisse into the arms of UBS.  In February, the decline accelerated as depositors cut their holdings at eurozone banks by €71.4bn, which was the biggest reduction since records began in 1997. Household deposits fell by €20.6bn, the largest fall since that data started to be collected in 2003. The withdrawals in the five months since October were worth 1.5 per cent of the almost €14tn that eurozone banks held for depositors and were less than the $500bn of deposits that have been pulled out of US banks in the past year. In the UK, there have been similar outflows of deposits by corporate customers, which withdrew £20.3bn from British banks and building societies in January, a record since this data started being collected in 2009, according to the latest Bank of England figures. However, UK household deposits continued to grow by £3.5bn. Banks in the eurozone have been slow to pass on higher interest rates to depositors. The ECB raised its deposit rate to 3 per cent this month, but the highest instant access rate for savers at German banks is 1.6 per cent, according to deposit broker Raisin.  This has prompted a switch from instant access accounts to longer term savings accounts offering higher rates. Overnight deposits at eurozone banks fell €140bn in February, taking the decline over the past six months to €512bn.  However, this was partially offset by an increase in deposits with an agreed maturity up to two years, which rose by €83bn in February and by €476.3bn in the past six months. Savers have also put more cash into money market funds and debt securities issued by banks.  The ECB said some of the withdrawn deposits were invested back into eurozone banks, which boosted their funding by issuing €155bn of bonds — more than two-thirds of them long-term securities — in the six months to February. “The data show that savers continued to tie up their cash in less liquid but higher yielding forms of money,” said Jack Allen-Reynolds, an economist at research group Capital Economics.  While depositors are reducing their overall holdings at eurozone banks, Allen-Reynolds said “they invested some of that money into bonds issued by banks, so this isn’t necessarily a sign that customers were losing faith in the banking system”. Total lending by banks to eurozone customers fell for the third consecutive month in February, taking the total three-month decline to €72bn and ending nearly five years of consistent growth.  Economists think this month’s turmoil in the banking sector is likely to make lenders more cautious, squeezing credit supply. “We expect loan growth to continue to slow down over the short term, and start recovering at a later stage when short-term rates find stability and the economic environment improves,” banking analysts at Jefferies said in a note.","27.03.2023"
"AstraZeneca chair says it is paying CEO enough to ward off US rivals","Drugmaker’s chief executive Pascal Soriot had talks last year about a role with US group Biogen","The new chair of AstraZeneca believes the drugmaker has extinguished the threat of chief executive Pascal Soriot quitting for lucrative roles in the US, saying that the benefit of increasing his pay in recent years outweighed the criticism from some shareholders. London’s largest listed company suffered a shareholder rebellion over pay in 2021 when, for a second consecutive year, it significantly increased the size of the bonus that Soriot could be awarded.  Michel Demaré, who headed the pharma group’s remuneration committee before starting as chair last week, said Soriot knew “that if he wanted to get more in the US, he would. But he has a very exciting project here. So I think we don’t believe it is an issue now”.  Under Soriot, who has led AstraZeneca for more than a decade, the group has become the most valuable company on the London market, with a market capitalisation of £185bn. Sales of its innovative cancer drugs has helped propel the group to three times the size of UK rival GSK. The assessment from Demaré came as the head of the London Stock Exchange said executives in the UK must be paid more if the City’s equity markets are going to be able to counter a growing threat from the US. “We should be encouraging and supporting UK companies to compete for talent on a global basis,” Julia Hoggett said this week.  Soriot’s record has made him a sought-after CEO within the pharma industry, where executives in the US are typically paid more.  The 63-year-old had early-stage talks with Biogen when the US biotech was looking for a new chief executive last year, according to people familiar with the matter.  Soriot was paid a total of £15mn last year, similar to the former Biogen chief executive’s pay in 2021, despite the US biotech being a far smaller company with a market capitalisation of £37bn. Biogen’s new CEO was given a signing-on package worth up to £24mn.   Demaré declined to comment directly on the Biogen talks, but said that at the far larger AstraZeneca Soriot could create “a few Biogens in the years to come”. Biogen declined to comment on the talks. AstraZeneca had shown Soriot that it was prepared to endure “major criticism” to increase his remuneration, Demaré added.  In 2021, roughly 40 per cent of the votes cast at the company’s annual general meeting were against the pay proposal, including from large UK shareholders such as Aviva and Standard Life Aberdeen. The UK pharma industry has previously lost executives over pay. In 2019, Namal Nawana, an Australian who had worked in the US, quit as chief executive of Smith & Nephew because the UK medical devices company could not meet his pay demands. Demaré said that investors had been concerned that Soriot could consider leaving AstraZeneca. It is “way too early” to talk about replacing Soriot, though he added that the Anglo-Swedish company does “desktop succession exercises”, as it would with any senior executive.  “I’m totally relaxed about it. It’s something that will probably come while I’m chair but if possible in the later years,” he said of the day when Soriot eventually departs.   Soriot said in February that he did not want to leave “any time soon” and that he hoped that, when the time came, an internal candidate would replace him. Demaré said Soriot should not have commented on that, because it was the responsibility of the board. Although AstraZeneca is headquartered in Cambridge, Soriot’s family home is in Australia — a situation that left him stranded in the country for months during the pandemic.  Demaré said that Soriot travelled all the time and managed it well, including taking conference calls at 3am if he was in Australia. “He has never shown that he was less committed or not available,” he said. As fears over the appeal of London’s stock market deepens, Demaré said he saw no “handicap” or discount from the company having its primary listing in London. AstraZeneca also has a secondary listing in New York. Best-known for its Covid-19 vaccine, which the company sold on a not-for-profit basis, Demaré said that Soriot had created a “fantastic pipeline” of drugs that would drive future growth.  “Some people say that I am joining at the top of the rollercoaster, and others that I’m jumping on a high-speed train and the role is to keep them on the rails,” he said. “It is not the end of the story.”  Demaré joined the board of AstraZeneca in 2019 and succeeded Leif Johansson as chair. Previously he was vice-chair of the board at UBS until May 2019, and chief financial officer of industrial group ABB.","04.05.2023"
"IMF chief warns of increased risks to financial stability","Kristalina Georgieva says uncertainties in the world economy remain ‘exceptionally high’","IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has warned of increased risks to financial stability and the need for vigilance following the recent banking sector turmoil in advanced economies. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, she said uncertainties in the world economy remained “exceptionally high”, with global economic growth expected to slow below 3 per cent this year because of the Ukraine war, “scarring” from the Covid-19 pandemic and monetary tightening.  “Risks to financial stability have increased at a time of higher debt levels,” Georgieva told the annual China Development Forum, a gathering for global chief executives and senior Chinese policymakers.   “The rapid transition from a prolonged period of low interest rates to much higher rates necessary to fight inflation inevitably generates stresses and vulnerabilities, as we have seen in recent developments in the banking sector.”  The global financial sector was shaken by the collapse of this month of a midsized US lender, Silicon Valley Bank, which led to the fall of another American institution and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.  Bank shares declined again on Friday, this time led by Deutsche Bank, forcing German chancellor Olaf Scholz to insist there was “no reason to be concerned” about the institution. “We also have seen policymakers acting decisively in response to financial stability risks and we have seen advanced economy central banks enhancing the provision of US dollar liquidity,” Georgieva said. “These actions have eased market stresses to some extent but uncertainty is high and that underscores the need for vigilance.” The IMF in January estimated global growth would slow from an estimated 3.4 per cent last year to 2.9 per cent in 2023, then rise to 3.1 per cent in 2024. “Even with a better outlook for 2024, global growth will remain below last decade’s average of 3.8 per cent,” Georgieva told the forum.  She also echoed the warnings voiced by several other speakers at the conference about the dangers of the world fragmenting into economic blocs, saying this would be “a dangerous division that will leave everyone poorer and less secure”.   The most positive development in the world economy this year was the expected strong economic rebound in China after it relaxed its strict Covid controls at the end of 2022, Georgieva said. The IMF forecasts growth of 5.2 per cent in China in 2023 compared with 3 per cent a year earlier.  China’s growth would account for about one-third of global growth this year, she said. “A 1 percentage point increase in GDP growth in China leads to 0.3 percentage growth in other Asian economies.”  Several global business chiefs have also attended the conference in Beijing despite rising trade and geopolitical tensions between the US and China.  Among other speakers, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, chair of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state’s central bank, said the recent macroeconomic challenges were only the “early consequences” of instability caused by a long period of low and negative real interest rates in advanced economies.  He described this extended period of easy monetary policy as the “largest mistake in macroeconomic policy in 70 years” and called for co-operation between the US and China as well as competition.  “How the US and China are able to combine competition . . . economic competition, with the need for co-operation is going to require considerable strategic ambition and strategic skill,” Shanmugaratnam said.   China’s finance minister Liu Kun said the world situation was challenging, with “unprecedented changes unfolding”, including more political tension, without elaborating. This year, China would moderately increase fiscal spending to support the economy, he added. ","26.03.2023"
"Analysts expect smaller ECB rate rises despite uptick in inflation","Surprise rise in price pressures complicates decision for rate-setters ahead of Thursday’s meeting","Eurozone inflation rose slightly in April, but most analysts predicted the European Central Bank would still slow the pace of its interest rate rises this week due to a sharp retreat in bank lending and a dip in underlying price pressures. Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, said the headline rate of eurozone inflation increased for the first time in six months to 7 per cent in the year to April. That was up from 6.9 per cent in the previous month and above the flat reading forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. However, analysts said ECB rate-setters, who target 2 per cent inflation, were likely to be swayed by a slowdown in core inflation — which strips out energy, food and other highly volatile items — to give a better impression of underlying price pressures.   The core inflation reading, which rate-setters have focused on in recent months, dipped to 5.6 per cent in the year to April, down from a eurozone record of 5.7 per cent in March — its first decline since June 2022. The ECB has increased its deposit rate from -0.5 per cent last summer to 3 per cent in March. Policymakers have said they expect to agree another increase this week, while adding that incoming data will determine whether they stick to a half-percentage point rise or slow to a quarter-point move. Ludovic Subran, chief economist at German insurer Allianz, said that after weaker than expected growth of 0.1 per cent in the eurozone economy, the latest data would give “more weight” to a quarter-point rate rise by the ECB on Thursday, followed by a couple more before the summer.  Analysts said the other factor likely to convince rate-setters to opt for a smaller rate rise this week was the publication of the ECB’s quarterly survey of banks, which showed eurozone lenders tightened their credit standards by the most since the region’s debt crisis erupted in 2011. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German investment bank Berenberg, said the data supported the arguments of both hawks and doves at the ECB, but he thought a quarter-point rate rise was “a bit more likely” with guidance that more hikes were still to come. The euro fell against the dollar after the ECB lending survey was published on Tuesday morning and lost more ground after the inflation data was released. Germany’s rate-sensitive two-year borrowing costs also lost some early gains, indicating investors think the ECB will opt for a smaller rate rise.  “We have strong conviction the ECB . . . is close to the end of its tightening cycle,” said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at investor MFS Investment Management.  The ECB said its quarterly survey of lenders, carried out in the final week of March and first week of April, showed that demand for loans from businesses has fallen at the fastest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. Loan demand from households also fell, at a rate only slightly slower than the unprecedented pace of the previous quarter. The behaviour of banks is being watched by central bankers because of the recent turmoil in the sector that started with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and continued when Credit Suisse was forced into the arms of rival UBS.  Economists say the tumult — which continued with the seizure of First Republic and sale of the US lender’s assets to JPMorgan Chase on Monday — will intensify the contraction of lending, squeeze demand and cool price pressures, reducing the amount of rate rises needed by the ECB. The survey found the main drivers for banks’ retreat from lending were “higher perceptions of risk” and “lower risk tolerance”. The ECB’s unprecedented increase in borrowing costs and its reduction of liquidity in recent months pushed up funding costs for banks and tightened credit standards.  The withdrawal of liquidity from the banking sector is set to accelerate in June when €480bn of ultra-cheap ECB funding to eurozone banks matures and the central bank is expected to accelerate the pace of shrinking its €5tn portfolio of bonds.  There was a further outflow of deposits from eurozone banks in March, putting an extra squeeze on their funding, separate ECB data showed on Tuesday. Overall deposits declined €62bn, slightly less than the record €68bn of outflows in the previous month.  Depositors are paying off debt or moving cash into bonds and money market funds that offer better returns than keeping it in banks. Eurozone household deposits fell €25bn, the largest fall since that data started to be collected in 2003. ","02.05.2023"
"Appetite for geopolitical risk management is growing","Consultancies are offering access to former top military and government officials to provide guidance on volatile events","From Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to worsening US-China relations, geopolitical disruptions were at the forefront of bankers’ minds at the start of the second quarter of this year. James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, told analysts in April that “geopolitical risks” ranked as one of the “wild cards out there, which we can’t really handicap”. In the same week, Jane Fraser, chief executive of Citigroup, warned on an earnings call: “We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the US-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs.” Colm Kelleher, chair of UBS, also in April, labelled the war in Ukraine as “a stark reminder of how fragile our world is”, and lamented the “general rise in geopolitical tensions”. To investors, those comments may sound like a cause for caution but, to a growing pack of consultants, they are also a business model validation. Firms including Lazard, Ankura, Kissinger Associates, Eurasia Group, Teneo’s WestExec Advisors, and The Cohen Group are all now pitching geopolitical risk-evaluation services — in a variety of forms and fee structures — to financial services executives.  But global companies’ growing appetite for geopolitical advice stems from more than the fact of war in Ukraine or US-China tensions. “When I first came to Washington, that kind of information was kept within a narrow group of people,” explains Dana White, former chief Pentagon spokesperson under ex-US defence secretary James Mattis, who in March joined Ankura’s global strategic advisory practice. “Now, the need to understand the context is so much greater because so many more people have that information.” The consultancies, however, are still testing how to package and price geopolitical risk analysis as they assess the “emerging” demand, says White. Ankura and many of its rivals offer, first and foremost, access to the knowledge of professionals with top government, military and diplomacy-focused credentials. In late 2021, Ankura acquired McLarty Associates, which is chaired by former White House chief of staff Thomas McLarty and ex-US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte. “There’s a whole cottage industry of former government officials who are basically putting up a shingle saying they’re here [to provide] advice,” says one executive at a company providing geopolitical-risk advice. In the past two years, Lazard also hired a trio of military and government intelligence veterans: Jami Miscik, a former CIA deputy director of intelligence; William McRaven, a retired US admiral who headed the hunt for Osama bin Laden; and John Abizaid, a former US general. In building the unit, Lazard’s approach was to blend “geopolitical insights from people who have deep experience and knowledge in the industry” with “business expertise within the investment bank”, says Theodore Bunzel, co-head of Lazard’s geopolitical advisory unit, which the investment bank launched in 2022.  The unit’s consultants deliver their geopolitical risk-evaluation services both as one-off events and, alternatively, as part of long-term retention relationships. Some clients seek five- to 10-year potential geopolitical scenarios. Others focus on a region, such as the Middle East, or on China — which dominates “the majority of conversations at the moment”, Bunzel says. Lazard has also begun helping companies establish their own internal, dedicated political risk-evaluation units. The consultancy’s senior advisers — McRaven, Abizaid and Miscik — share “a very strong process-orientation around these issues”, Bunzel says. “They bring the kind of discipline of how you think in a structured way, identify and then monitor the important risks, and how you forecast scenarios.” An emerging question is how much corporate clients will pay for geopolitical-risk evaluation. “It’s an unregulated industry right now,” says Daniel Hartnett, director of third-party risk intelligence at London Stock Exchange Group, with reference to pricing. “It’s a little bit of a wild west approach.”  Some providers insist that corporate clients purchase all their services at once; others offer à la carte menus. Some market low-cost subscriptions to regular published analysis as a loss leader. As an executive at one of the providers explains, the idea is to “hook you in” — in the hope that clients will then buy the firm’s services for “a special project down the line”. Price-wise, Lazard falls at the higher end. It offers customised “consulting-style engagement” and provides significant, direct access to the firm’s senior advisers, which are “one of our most valuable assets”, Bunzel says. However, Kenneth Jacobs, chair and CEO of Lazard, told an industry conference audience in December that geopolitical risk consulting “is never going to be a several hundred million[dollar] business”.  Instead, his view is: “What’s really wonderful about it is it’s a form of dialogue . . . at a moment in time where companies are starved of this kind of dialogue.” This article has been amended to remove an incorrect attribution.

"Top regulator urges tighter rules for global financial system","Pablo Hernández de Cos says lenders are at risk from links to shadow banks","The head of the world’s top financial regulator has called for tighter rules to clamp down on risks spreading from so-called shadow banks to other parts of the banking system.  Pablo Hernández de Cos, chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, said on Friday that events of recent years highlighted the dangers of the close links between shadow banks, such as funds and insurers, and regular lenders.  “The market turmoil in March 2020, idiosyncratic episodes of distress and margin dynamics have highlighted how these channels of interconnections . . . can pose risks to banks,” he said.   While “great progress” had been made in making banks more resilient, rules governing the links between lenders and shadow banks, officially known as non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs), may not be “sufficient”.  He signalled there might be a need for additional measures “aimed at mitigating risks to the banking system from interconnections with NBFIs”. Hernández said the remarks were his “personal views” and not those of the committee. They follow a month of turmoil in the banking sector, which has led to the failure of three US lenders including Silicon Valley Bank and the collapse of Credit Suisse into the arms of UBS. Hernández reiterated the committee’s calls for banks and supervisors to be “vigilant” and to closely monitor the “financial stability risks of higher interest rates to the global banking system”.  “As central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation, borrowers are now facing sharply rising debt service burdens,” said Hernández, who is also governor of Spain’s central bank. “A broad-based repricing in asset markets could also expose banks to additional risks and new risk management challenges.” The Financial Stability Board, which brings together top policymakers, called in December for “urgent work” to address gaping holes in regimes to deal with failing NBFIs, such as clearing houses and insurers, whose operations stretch across borders.  Hernández said a second area “that could potentially benefit from further global work” were the limits on mortgage lending applied by many regulators around the world to restrict how much banks could lend in relation to the value of a property or a borrower’s income.  “While these homegrown measures have generally worked well and committee members have been sharing approaches and experiences, the question is whether benefits would accrue from a common set of global principles for designing and operationalising such measures,” he said. Basel Committee members met in Hong Kong this week to discuss recent market developments. The global rule-setter, best known for ramping up banks’ capital and liquidity requirements after the 2008 financial crisis, said it had “agreed to take stock of the regulatory and supervisory implications stemming from recent events, with a view to learn lessons”. The turmoil has led other regulators to put forward fresh ideas for supervising the global financial system. Claude Wampach, a Luxembourg-based member of the Basel Committee, told the Financial Times that one area regulators might look at is whether the liquidity coverage ratio was “sufficiently calibrated”. The ratio requires banks to hold enough assets that are easy to sell quickly such as government bonds to meet likely deposit outflows during a crisis. The only way to entirely prevent a bank run would be to require them to keep all of their deposits in highly liquid assets, Wampach said, “but then you wouldn’t have banks any more”.

"Hedge funds made $7bn from betting against banks during turmoil","Short sellers’ March haul was their largest from the banking sector since 2008","Hedge funds made more than $7bn in profits by betting against bank shares during the recent crisis that rocked the sector, their biggest such haul since the 2008 financial crisis. The bumper gains came during a bleak month for banks, with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the emergency sale of Credit Suisse affecting the wider sector. Amid plunging share prices, German chancellor Olaf Scholz was forced to dismiss fears about the health of Deutsche Bank and California-based First Republic was bailed out by larger rivals. Short sellers — who borrow stock and sell it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price — made estimated total profits of about $1.3bn from short positions taken against SVB, according to data group Ortex. A further $848mn in gains came from bets against First Republic, whose shares fell 89 per cent in March.  Investors made $684mn from shorting Credit Suisse, as a crisis of confidence in the Swiss lender sent its shares tumbling 71 per cent, according to the data. Profits from short positions across the US and European banking sector as a whole totalled $7.2bn. “March was the single most profitable month for short sellers in the banking sector since the 2008 financial crash,” said Ortex co-founder Peter Hillerberg. While bank stocks also fell sharply in early 2020 during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, fewer funds were shorting the sector at the time, limiting gains, he said. Barry Norris, chief investment officer at Argonaut Capital, said he had enjoyed a “stellar” month, thanks to bets against banks including Credit Suisse and First Republic. His Argonaut Absolute Return fund gained more than 6 per cent. London-based Marshall Wace, one of the world’s biggest hedge fund groups, was also among those placing bets, shorting 0.7 per cent of Deutsche Bank’s shares. Funds netted gains of about $40mn from bets against the German lender. Many hedge funds responded to the growing turmoil by increasing their short positions. Bets against Credit Suisse, for instance, were running at just 3.5 per cent of the bank’s outstanding shares at the start of March, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, as measured by shares out on loan, but had jumped to 14 per cent by March 20, the day after Credit Suisse was sold to UBS.   Short interest in First Republic rocketed from just 1.3 per cent at the start of March to 38.5 per cent by March 30. Other managers who benefited include Ravi Chopra’s US-based hedge fund group Azora Capital, which profited from bets against US regional banks, according to a person familiar with its positions. Azora did not respond to a request for comment. Short sellers’ gains on Deutsche, however, were more muted. While bets against the bank were quickly raised from 1.4 per cent at the start of March to as much as 6.1 per cent by March 28, the bank’s shares had already bottomed on March 24 — the day of Scholz’s comments — and have since recovered some ground, eroding funds’ gains. Hedge funds appear to be expecting further problems to emerge in the sector. Short interest in First Republic remains only marginally below the March high at 37.3 per cent, while bets against Deutsche have also fallen only slightly. Argonaut’s Norris highlighted the US Federal Reserve’s liquidity assistance programme announced last month. This, he said, reduced the risk of weaker US regional banks going bust owing to a lack of liquidity, but the high rate of interest being charged could lead to “a catastrophic impact on net interest margins, creating a solvency risk”. “The liquidity crisis is probably over, but the solvency crisis is about to begin,” he said.","05.04.2023"
"US Treasuries rally and dollar falls on signs of cooling labour market","Wall Street retreats as S&P 500 snaps four-day advance","US Treasuries rallied and the dollar weakened on Tuesday after demand for workers in the world’s biggest economy fell, raising hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon hit the brakes on its monetary tightening campaign. The yield on two-year US Treasury notes — which move with interest rate expectations — fell 0.13 percentage points to 3.84 per cent. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries fell 0.07 percentage points to 3.34 per cent. The dollar slipped 0.5 per cent against a basket of six other major currencies. The moves came after data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job openings fell from 10.6mn in January to 9.9mn in February, the lowest monthly figure since May 2021. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline to 10.4mn.  Lay-offs fell by 215,000 to 1.5mn, while voluntary departures rose 146,000 to 4mn. They are considered more reliable figures than the volatile openings number.  The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent, ending a four-day rally, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5 per cent, as markets weighed the potential effect of a cooling labour market on economic growth and inflation. Traders are split over whether the Federal Reserve will press ahead with a further quarter percentage point rate rise or leave borrowing costs unchanged when it meets in early May. US equities have recovered from losses in early March. “For a rational investor, we think this makes little sense,” JPMorgan said. “Most of the inflows” into stocks had been driven by a decline in volatility, systematic investors and those covering short positions, it added. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said the S&P’s 7 per cent rally this year against a backdrop of banking sector turmoil had been driven by 20 of the largest stocks, with the market capitalisation of the remaining 480 having “basically not gone up”. “The implication for investors is that this market is not driven by broad-based higher growth expectations, but instead by what has happened with rates, in particular after [Silicon Valley Bank] went under,” Slok added. Bank stocks also retreated, with the KBW Bank index off 2 per cent. Earlier in the day, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive and one of the banking industry’s elder statesmen, warned the crisis is “not yet over” and its effects will be felt for “years to come”.  Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, settled roughly flat on the day at $84.94 after jumping 6.4 per cent on Monday, following Saudi Arabia’s surprise move to implement a “voluntary cut” of 500,000 barrels a day, or just under 5 per cent of its output. Opec+ member Russia also said it would extend its existing 500,000 b/d production cut until the end of the year. US marker West Texas Intermediate on Tuesday rose 0.4 per cent to $80.71 a barrel, having surged 6.3 per cent on Monday. UBS said Brent could reach $100 a barrel by June, while JPMorgan expected prices to average $89 a barrel over the next three months before rising to $96 a barrel by the end of 2023. Saudi Arabia and Russia’s reduction in supply was “a pre-emptive measure” designed to ensure surpluses that began accumulating in the global oil market in mid-2022 “don’t extend into the second half of 2023 as the global economy slows” because of higher interest rates, JPMorgan said. Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 closed flat and London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.5 per cent. Sterling rose 0.7 per cent against the dollar.","04.04.2023"
"China’s economy rebounds more than expected after Covid reopening","GDP expands 4.5% year on year in first quarter as Xi Jinping’s government seeks to restore business confidence","China’s gross domestic product expanded 4.5 per cent year on year in the first quarter, as strong growth in exports and infrastructure investment as well as a rebound in retail consumption and property prices drove a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy. The official figure, which exceeded analyst expectations of a 4 per cent rise, followed efforts by Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government to restore business confidence damaged by pandemic controls last year and abrupt policy changes. The January-March growth rate was still short of the government’s full-year target of 5 per cent, held back by a nationwide Covid-19 outbreak at the start of this year, but economists expect it to pick up pace as the year progresses.  Xi, who formally embarked on an unprecedented third term as China’s president last month, is keen to revive economic growth. Gross domestic product expanded just 3 per cent last year, missing the official target of 5.5 per cent which was already the lowest in decades. “Definitely, the recovery’s on track,” said Tao Wang, UBS chief China economist. “The momentum at the beginning of the year was stronger than expected.” China’s rebound is crucial to global economic growth this year as developed nations grapple with persistently high inflation, rising interest rates and sluggish expansion in the wake of the pandemic and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “The national economy showed a steady recovery and made a good start,” China’s National Bureau of Statistics said. But the agency cautioned the situation was “complex and volatile, inadequate domestic demand remains prominent and the foundation for economic recovery is not solid yet”.  Chinese commodities markets rallied following Tuesday’s data release, but equities failed to hold on to early gains. China abandoned zero-Covid restrictions in December amid popular opposition to the rolling lockdowns that paralysed cities across the country for most of the year. The easing unleashed pent-up demand in the retail sector, where sales rose 5.8 per cent year on year in the first quarter and 10.6 per cent in March. But the base of comparison with last year was low, given that Shanghai started a months-long lockdown in late February 2022.  Premier Li Qiang, Xi’s new number two, signalled at China’s rubber-stamp parliament last month that the government would relax a crackdown on business that has wiped billions of dollars from property developers and internet platforms. Manufacturing investment rose 7 per cent year on year in the first quarter and industrial output gained 3 per cent. Exports showed strong growth, up 8.4 per cent in the first quarter, and state-led infrastructure investment climbed 8.8 per cent, while overall fixed asset investment rose 5.1 per cent. Private investment was weak, up just 0.6 per cent, suggesting a decline in March. The property sector’s woes continued, with new housing starts tumbling 19.2 per cent year on year in the first quarter. Home sales by area declined 1.8 per cent but sales by value rose 4.1 per cent, pointing to a nascent recovery in prices. In March, new home prices rose at their fastest pace in 21 months. The jobless rate fell to 5.3 per cent in March from 5.6 per cent in February, but youth unemployment hit the second-highest mark on record, at 19.6 per cent. Economists said momentum would pick up in the second quarter, helped by the low base effect, but warned that consumption and property might struggle to maintain strong growth, while exports could be threatened by weaker developed markets. Xi’s administration also remained hamstrung by a lack of credibility after hobbling the private sector, experts said.  Keyu Jin, a professor at the London School of Economics and author of The New China Playbook, said the biggest obstacle was the gap in private sector demand, both in consumption and investment. “It will take time for confidence to come back to the Chinese economy,” she said.

"FirstFT: Legal firms Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling plan to merge","Also in today’s newsletter, G7 ends with promise of a ‘thaw’ in US-China tensions, and JPMorgan holds annual shareholder meeting ","We start today with one of the biggest transatlantic legal tie-ups in history. The London law firm Allen & Overy is merging with New York’s Shearman & Sterling to form a practice with combined revenues of about $3.4bn. The merger, which is subject to a vote of both firms’ partners, will create one of the largest law firms in the world by fee income and comes just months after 150-year-old Shearman abandoned merger talks with rival Hogan Lovells.  Allen Overy Shearman Sterling, as the newly combined firm is to be known, will employ nearly 4,000 lawyers spread across 49 offices. The proposed deal represents the first merger between a London-based “magic circle” firm and an American rival since Clifford Chance joined up with Rogers & Wells in 2000. The tie-up follows a tumultuous period for Shearman, which has lost a number of lawyers following the aborted talks with Hogan Lovells earlier this year and has been undergoing a difficult restructuring. For Allen & Overy it represents a long sought after opportunity to enter the lucrative US legal market, which has proved difficult for London-based firms to crack. The deal is expected to be put to partners in both firms before the summer, with the aim of reaching completion within six to 12 months.

"Allwyn planning to bid for majority stake in Irish lottery ","Czech group looks to further expansion after winning the contract to operate UK’s national sweepstake","Allwyn, Europe’s biggest lottery group, is among the operators planning to enter the race to buy a majority stake in the Irish national lottery, hoping to fuel its ambitious expansion plans by snapping up another gaming asset.  Czech Republic-based Allwyn held talks with UBS bankers working on the sale and the Irish lottery’s management team in March, according to people close to the process. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, which has a stake of nearly 80 per cent in Premier Lotteries Ireland, kicked off a sale process in February.  OTPP was awarded a 20-year licence to run the Irish franchise in 2014, as part of a consortium comprising An Post, the Irish post office, which had operated the lottery since its inception in 1987, and An Post pension funds. The consortium paid €405mn for the licence, which runs through to 2034.   Australian operator The Lottery Corporation and semi-publicly owned French operator Française des Jeux as well as New York-listed lottery companies International Game Technology and Scientific Games are also considering bidding for OTPP’s majority stake, according to two people close to the sale process.  OTPP, Allwyn, The Lottery Corporation and FDJ all declined to comment, while IGT and Scientific Games did not respond to a request for comment “Look at the lottery operators that have the money and that are looking for growth and . . . that’s a list that is long enough to have a competitive process but it’s also short enough to be very tailored with only super-motivated buyers,” said a person working on the sale.  Allwyn last year won the tender process for the next UK National Lottery licence, starting in February 2024, and then proceeded to take over incumbent operator Camelot, also owned by OTPP, in a £120mn deal.  Allwyn also bought Camelot Lottery Solutions — which owns the Illinois lottery and runs the technology division of Camelot, operating the online systems for lotteries across Europe and North America — in a separate £200mn deal with OTPP.  The group posted revenues of nearly €4bn last year, up 24 per cent on the year before. Its operations also include lotteries in the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Austria.   Allwyn had been planning to go public in a €9.3bn Spac merger with blank-cheque company Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp but both parties called off the deal in September citing volatile market conditions. The lottery operator, which was rebranded from Sazka in 2021, is owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komárek. As part of the string of deals with OTPP, Allwyn also expressed interest last year in buying the majority stake in Ireland, but OTPP instead opted to auction it off pointing to its value with more than a decade left on the licence.  Since its launch in 1987, Premier Lotteries Ireland has generated more than €5.5bn for good causes, donating around 30 cents of every €1 spent to worthy projects. Last year, the Irish lottery generated gross gaming revenues of €400mn and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of between €40mn-€45mn.  Some bidders believe Allwyn has a competitive edge in the auction because its subsidiary Camelot Lottery Solutions runs the online draw for the Irish game, while an alternative operator may be put off by having to search for a new technology supplier. The sale process is expected to be concluded by summer. Any deal would have to be approved by the Irish lottery regulator.  Premier Lotteries Ireland declined to comment on the sale process but said it remained “wholly committed” to operating a “world-class” lottery that raises “much-needed good cause funds for the benefit of local communities throughout Ireland”. The Regulator of the National Lottery and An Post declined to comment. ","04.04.2023"
"India’s Axis Bank chief warns over risks of slowing growth","Private-sector lender has completed takeover of Citibank assets","One of India’s leading bankers has said lenders need to stay vigilant about the outlook for India’s economy despite the country’s recent rapid robust growth. Axis Bank chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said he was “watchful” over consumer demand in the economy and said expectations for growth “might have to be tempered a little bit” as India’s post-pandemic economic rebound loses steam and as global economic volatility makes forecasting more difficult. “Right now, the data seems to indicate that broadly things are ok, but not everything is ok,” said Chaudhry, speaking at the bank’s headquarters in Mumbai.   “The private [capital expenditure] has picked up, but not enough. [The] government is obviously still spending a lot of money . . . but will it lead to a general pickup in demand? I think we have to be watchful.” The Reserve Bank of India is meeting this week to discuss interest rate policy, with the country’s inflation rate at 6.4 per cent, above the bank’s upper tolerance band of 4 to 6 per cent. The RBI’s policy rate is at 6.5 per cent and analysts expect the central bank will make a further increase at its meeting this week.  Chaudhry said growth could be affected if rate increases pass a “point of inflection” which is “not far away”, but praised India’s central bank and government for being “on top of the game”. India’s economy grew 4.4 per cent in the final quarter of 2022, down from 6.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The country’s statistics agency expects 7 per cent growth for the financial year ending this March, below 9.1 per cent the previous year. Axis Bank, which is India’s third-largest private sector bank by assets, last month completed its takeover of Citibank’s India consumer business, a Rs116bn ($1.4bn) deal that expands Axis’s wealth management and credit card businesses. It also acquired Rs399bn of deposits. Indian banks are competing hard for deposits as they step up lending, in a scramble Chaudhry describes as a “rugby game” between domestic lenders.   The acquisition comes as Axis tries to rebuild its image after a damaging front-running trading scandal at its mutual fund. Sebi, India’s securities regulator, in February barred the Axis mutual fund’s former chief dealer and 20 other people and entities, charging them with having used insider knowledge about the mutual fund’s bets to make huge personal trading profits. Chaudhry said Axis had learnt lessons from the incident and was fully complying with regulators. Sebi is “becoming tougher, and I don’t blame the regulator”, Chaudhry said. The bank has overhauled the management of the mutual fund, including hiring Credit Suisse veteran Ashish Gupta to be its chief investment officer. On market volatility caused by a short-seller’s report on the Adani Group, an Indian conglomerate, Chaudhry said he was confident about Axis’s level of exposure to the sprawling power-to-ports Indian conglomerate. Chaudhry said he was “quite comfortable” with 0.9 per cent of the bank’s loans having been made to Adani’s operating companies. The banker credited Adani with responding to market concerns. “They have stopped investment in certain areas, they have tried to reduce the debt at the holding company and promoter level,” he said. “They have been quite vocal that, if they are required to, they will be happy to sell assets.” Chaudhry said he was not concerned about the stability of India’s banking system following collapses at US and European banks and said the country was “unlikely to see any major impact” from failures such as that of Credit Suisse, which was taken over by Swiss rival UBS in March.   “Indian banks are well capitalised,” he said. India was the world’s fastest-growing major economy and remained an attractive market, Chaudhry added. “India is the only large market which is left where you can gain scale and some of the large global companies can show some real growth.”","04.04.2023"
"Jamie Dimon turns tide of criticism over JPMorgan’s big spending plans","Wall Street’s longest-serving chief heads into investor day emboldened by successes even as Epstein lawsuits loom large","This time last year, Jamie Dimon was preparing for JPMorgan’s investor day at a rare moment of weakness, with shareholders raising concerns over the bank’s $15bn investment plans and rebelling against his pay. Fast forward 12 months and the longest-serving big bank chief executive on Wall Street is heading into the same event having apparently regained his mojo, buoyed by the acquisition of the remnants of First Republic and a shareholder base that is far less restive. This past week, his pay secured the backing of almost 90 per cent of investors. Dimon has been in his element acting as Wall Street’s unofficial ambassador to Washington on the recent regional banking crisis and during the debt-ceiling debate. People close to the 67-year-old, who is often said to thrive during crises, describe him as having an extra spring in his step in recent months.  Indeed, the past 12 months might have been seen as one of the better periods of his almost two-decade tenure were it not for the drip-drip of damaging revelations from two lawsuits related to the bank’s relationship with the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Now, as Dimon prepares to address shareholders at this year’s investor day, he has to convince them that the bank — the biggest in the US — still has plenty of room to expand.  “There’s no reason for us to think the company can’t continue to grow and leverage economies of scale, and just continue to serve their existing customers with more products and acquire new customers,” said Jason Goldberg, banking analyst at Barclays.  The bank’s shares have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 and the KBW banking index in the last year, and it has emerged as one of the winners in the recent regional banking crisis. In a research note this week, Wells Fargo analysts estimated JPMorgan’s market capitalisation could more than double within seven years to $1tn, reaching a level that has been the preserve of tech and oil companies. “They seem to have been a beneficiary of deposit inflows in the wake of the banking turmoil that occurred in March with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,” said John McDonald, senior analyst covering large-cap banks at Autonomous Research. Despite the optimism, the Epstein lawsuits loom large. Dimon is scheduled to be deposed in the case later this month. The judge handling the litigation will rule shortly whether or not one of the plaintiffs, an alleged Epstein victim, can expand her case into a class-action lawsuit.  JPMorgan is also dealing with the fallout from its $175mn acquisition of student financial planning start-up Frank; the bank subsequently allegedly vastly overstated its user numbers. Dimon described the deal as a “huge mistake”. Frank’s founder Charlie Javice was this week formally indicted on charges that she defrauded the bank, but the episode has raised questions about JPMorgan’s due diligence.  Part of JPMorgan’s growth has been teed up by investments that had come under fire from shareholders. This time last year, they were questioning the bank for failing to outline in more detail the rationale for spending $15bn, an error which Dimon tried to rectify last year. “They’ve had the luxury of being such a strong bank for a while that they’ve been constantly investing in the franchise, probably more than any other bank,” said David Konrad, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Analysts now say the spending on initiatives including cloud computing, hiring and marketing is starting to result in market share gains. “What JPMorgan has proven over this past year, is that they’re generating nice returns on those investments,” said Erika Najarian, banking analyst at UBS. At the investor day, Dimon will be joined by leaders of the bank’s four business divisions, who are expected to deliver presentations on corporate and investment banking, consumer and community banking, commercial banking and asset and wealth management. Analysts expect the presentation from consumer and community banking co-heads Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak to shed further light on JPMorgan’s deal for First Republic in April. The acquisition increases JPMorgan’s presence in wealth management, one of the few areas where it is not a dominant player.   Analysts are also hoping for an update on JPMorgan’s digital-only international consumer bank that began operating in the UK in 2021. The bank disclosed last year that it expects to lose more than $1bn in the next few years on the effort before breaking even by 2028.  If Dimon is still chief executive by then, he would have held the job for more than 20 years. He has given no indication that he plans to step down any time soon and stands to earn a projected $50mn if he is still in charge by 2026. Nevertheless, investors will look to the investor day as a chance to size up potential internal candidates who could take the reins from Dimon. “Investor day remains one of the best windows to evaluate JPM’s broader management line-up,” Autonomous Research analysts wrote in a note this week, “and think about who will eventually succeed Mr Dimon”.

"FirstFT: Expect more US interest rate rises, economists warn","Also in today’s newsletter, Silvio Berlusconi dies, and UBS’s ‘red lines’ for Credit Suisse staff","The US Federal Reserve will need to take tougher action than expected to bring inflation under control, according to a majority of leading academic economists polled by the Financial Times, who predict at least two more quarter-point interest rate increases this year. The latest survey, conducted in partnership with the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, predicts the Fed will lift its benchmark rate to at least 5.5 per cent this year. Fed funds futures markets suggest investors favour just one more quarter-point rate rise in July above the current range of between 5 per cent and 5.25 per cent, the highest level since mid-2007.  The survey results were published ahead of the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate-setting meeting which starts tomorrow. The US central bank is expected to pause its aggressive policy of tightening monetary policy after 10 consecutive rate rises since March 2022 while keeping the door opening to further tightening.  Of the 42 economists surveyed between June 5 and June 7, 67 per cent forecast the federal funds rate to peak between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent this year. That is up from 49 per cent in the previous survey, which ran just days after a string of bank failures in March.  “They haven’t done enough for long enough yet to get inflation down,” said Dean Croushore, who served as an economist at the Fed’s Philadelphia Reserve Bank for 14 years. “They are on the right path, but the path is going to be longer and more tortuous than they ever thought.” The latest inflation data will be released tomorrow. The annual core rate of inflation, which strips out the cost of energy and food, rose 5.5 per cent in April.  The Federal Reserve is expected to update its interest rate expectations following the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. Go deeper: Consensus on the Federal Reserve board is breaking down about the pace at which US inflation will moderate and just how close the economy is to a cliff edge.Opinion: Unless the inflation data due out tomorrow shows significant weakness, the Fed’s proposed course of action to “skip” a rise will end up as a muddled option, rendering future decisions even more challenging, argues Mohamed El-Erian.Have your say: Do you think the Fed will raise interest rates once or twice in the remainder of this year?

"Asia investors ‘gobsmacked’ by $17bn Credit Suisse bond wipeout","Risky AT1 debt was popular in the region and a sell-off has sparked margin calls ","The wipeout of $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds has sparked panic among rich Asian investors who had loaded up on the risky bank debt.  Under the terms of the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, orchestrated by the Swiss government on Sunday, Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 bonds were written down to zero while shareholders received $3.25bn. The surprise decision stung some retail investors in Asia who are exposed to AT1s, a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet.  “We haven’t slept since Sunday,” said one Singapore-based private banker. “People are completely gobsmacked.” In other parts of the world, the bonds are typically owned by institutional investors. Pimco, Invesco and Legg Mason are among the top holders of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds, according to Bloomberg data. Asia’s AT1 market is estimated to represent about $46bn out of the global total of $260bn.  The wipeout of Credit Suisse’s AT1s stunned investors because it forced bigger losses on some bondholders than shareholders, upending the traditional hierarchy of creditors. Other regulators including the European Central Bank have since stressed that they would not follow the Swiss method in resolving a failing bank in their jurisdiction. Some investors are threatening legal action. Asian private bank clients led selling on Monday, where some panicked sellers pushed down AT1s issued by banks in Asia by between 2 and 10 points, depending on the country. The market for the bonds recovered on Tuesday but Asia AT1s were still lower than last week.  The selling included wealthy clients who owned the AT1s with leverage and were receiving margin calls, said two private bankers.   Retail investors in Europe do not typically hold AT1s, and they are barred from doing so in jurisdictions including the UK.  In Asia, the instruments were popular with wealthy individuals who appreciated the brand names and the yields. A Credit Suisse bond issued last year and paying a 9.75 per cent coupon was particularly popular. Angelina Lai, chief executive of the Hong Kong unit of the wealth manager St James’s Place, said her company had been asked about the instruments as recently as three weeks ago. “We advised against the individuals holding the asset class directly, based on the complexity of the product and our strong views of keeping a diversified investment portfolio that is risk managed and rewarded accordingly,” she said. Some investors also worried that issuance of new AT1 debt might dry up following the Credit Suisse takeover. AT1s are perpetual in maturity, but banks typically “call” the debt after an initial period and issue fresh bonds to finance the repayment to investors. “There is the fact that the banks know they can’t issue more AT1s anytime soon, so may stop calling them. It has significant issues for valuation,” said one Singapore-based fund manager with regional rich clients.  A banker at one of Singapore’s top private banks said many wealthy private investors were angry. “A lot of clients are in shock, they didn’t understand the writedown risk under certain scenarios. It is not mass selling but a fair few want to get out.”  The banker said they could not disclose the identity of clients but that they were wealthy Asia individuals banking in Singapore and Hong Kong, including small to midsized family offices.

"Fink’s on the prowl again","And he’s got a 12-bore shotgun","There are many ‘key learnings’ from the weekend’s Swiss banking shenanigans, such as how even apparently well-capitalised and liquid GSIB banks can keel over in a matter of days, that AT1 bondholders are vulnerable to political whims, and how Middle East investors should really stay away from western banks.  But one obscured by the fallout is that Larry Fink is on the hunt, and he’s out for elephants.  From mainFT’s excellent tick-tock on how the UBS-CS shotgun marriage went down:  The US firm’s chief executive had convened his inner circle on Thursday and told them a line he has used repeatedly: “To be in the game you’ve got to play it,” one person involved remembers.During the financial crisis, BlackRock bought Barclays’s investment arm BGI in 2009 for $15.2bn, a transformational deal that made it the world’s biggest asset manager with $2.7tn of assets. Since then, it has grown to dominate the global investment industry and manage $8.6tn. It spied a similar opportunity in Credit Suisse’s troubles. That Fink likes a big deal (and is unusually good at getting them to work) is not new. In addition to the BGI acquisition there was also the purchase of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in 2006. Before that there was State Street Research in 2004. There have also been whispers in and around BlackRock for some time that Fink has another big deal in him.   For ages the assumption has been that it is primarily keen on doing something big in private capital, an area where BlackRock is relatively underpowered. The FT has already reported that it sniffed around Carlyle when the private equity firm was in turmoil last year, but nothing came of it. It seems what attracted Fink to Credit Suisse was the wealth management bit, with the rest to be flogged on to others or run down (we don’t buy that it was CS’s trading capacity that attracted BlackRock, a firm set up by a bunch of former bond traders that have invested heavily in electronic trading). That opens up an intriguing new avenue for investment bankers keen to pitch acquisition targets to BlackRock Obviously, wealth management is a different business from the asset management that BlackRock does, but it kinda makes sense?  BlackRock is basically the world’s biggest manufacturer of investment products. It distributes those to primarily institutional investors through its own sales network, and to retail investors through ETFs on various platforms and financial advisers. But it doesn’t really have Fidelity and now Vanguard’s broader and direct relationship with retail clients. Buying Credit Suisse Wealth Management would instantly give it a way to sell its wares directly to the world’s upper class. :banksThe problem is that there’s almost nothing out there that compares to Credit Suisse, so thinking up alternative fantasy M&A targets is tricky.  That BlackRock appears to have quickly stepped aside when the Swiss told them to sod off might also indicate that Fink is in reality lukewarm on the idea (or was just very wary of also taking on the migraine of Credit Suisse’s investment bank in the same go). BlackRock is also highly sensitive to anything that would put it even more in the eyesights of politicians and regulators.   But that probably won’t deter FIG investment bankers, who we’re sure are getting those PowerPoint presentations polished as we type.

"Petrobras CEO says not keeping oil reserves up would be ‘fatal error’","Brazilian oil major is trying to overcome opposition to plans for drilling off the mouth of the Amazon river","The new boss of Petrobras said it would be a “fatal error” not to replenish its oil reserves, as the Brazilian state-controlled company tries to overcome opposition to plans for drilling off the mouth of the Amazon river. Jean Paul Prates, who took the helm of Latin America’s largest oil and gas producer this year, argued securing more crude deposits was vital in parallel to preparing for the energy transition. Petrobras is appealing against a decision by Brazil’s environment agency, which recently rejected its request to set up an exploratory well 175km from the country’s northern coastline.  The deepwater block is in an area of the Atlantic Ocean seen as one of the next frontiers for extraction, but campaigners say the site in question is ecologically rich and fragile. “It’s a new horizon for us,” Prates told the Financial Times in an interview at the group’s Rio de Janeiro headquarters. “We have to worry about replenishing reserves. We can’t simply [say] no more oil and it’s over. For an oil company, this is not possible. “You would be making the biggest mistake of your life. That would be a fatal error, which would decree the death of the company in 30 years.”  Petrobras management has increased the budget for decarbonisation initiatives from 6% of its total $78bn capital expenditure over the next four years to a maximum 15% © Ricardo Moraes/Reuters The former senator was chosen as chief executive by leftwing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office in January promising significant changes at the $87bn-valued business. Lula has demanded Petrobras play a greater role in the shift to low-carbon energy with investments in activities such as renewables and biofuels.  But he also wants the company to increase refining capacity to make Brazil self-sufficient in oil products. At the same time, Lula has criticised high dividends paid by Petrobras on the back of bumper profits, unnerving some minority shareholders.  Founded 70 years ago as Petróleo Brasileiro, the business is listed on the stock market but the government is its biggest shareholder. Prates said it needed to be an “integrated energy company” to confront future challenges and that fossil fuel revenues would help fund clean energy investments.  “In the energy transition this is important, because in an oil company the present pays for the future,” he added. “You have to reinvent [yourself] to be something else in 30 years. You probably won’t be selling oil and gas, or very little.” With output from Petrobras’ existing “pre-salt” fields — rich offshore deposits under a 2km-thick layer of sodium chloride — forecast to peak by the end of the decade, there will be a pressing need for new sources of income.   However, diversification would reverse the strategy behind a successful turnround of recent years. The company has sold non-core assets such as petrol stations and refineries in order to focus on pumping deep-sea oil and reduce borrowings. For some, the prospect of increased government influence has stirred memories of past mis-steps that caused considerable financial damage.  During the last period of leftwing rule in Brazil, Petrobras was at the centre of a massive political corruption scandal and racked up huge debts after investing heavily in offshore production and being forced to keep diesel artificially cheap under president Dilma Rousseff. Expensive refinery projects went over budget or unfinished. Corporate governance has since been strengthened and Prates, a 54 year-old politician from Lula’s Workers’ Party with industry experience, insisted there would be no repeat of the mistakes.  “My message is very strong. It won’t happen,” he said. “This type of error — mismanaging the company — we will not commit.” The new Petrobras management has increased the budget for decarbonisation initiatives from 6 per cent of its total $78bn capital expenditure over the next four years to a maximum 15 per cent. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s president, wants Petrobras to boost refining capacity to make Brazil self-sufficient in oil products © Nelson Almeida/AFP via Getty Images Describing the group’s recent profits as “exorbitant”, Prates said overall capex would “probably” rise and confirmed the company was looking at cutting shareholder payouts: “It will be nothing scary or traumatic.” Petrobras is examining potential projects in offshore wind and “green hydrogen” produced with low-carbon electricity. Along with re-entering areas it previously exited, such as fertilisers and renewable power, the CEO said the company should also look “seriously” at petrochemicals, which are used in everything from plastics and soaps to paints and medicine. “It could be one of the bridges to the transition,” he added. “Future gasoline demand is projected to be much lower. So you need to prepare for this volume of oil that you are producing to be used in a noble way.” Local media have suggested Petrobras might make a bid for Braskem, Latin America’s biggest petrochemicals producer, in which it already owns a 36 per cent equity holding. A controlling stake in the $5bn-valued company is up for sale by Braskem’s largest shareholder, the construction conglomerate Novonor. Offers have been tabled by Brazilian chemicals group Unipar Carbocloro and a consortium of US private equity group Apollo and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.   Petrobras has the first right of refusal in the event of any buyout bid. Prates said no decision had yet been made, but added: “It is important that [Braskem] remains under Brazilian control, not necessarily for ideological reasons, but as an issue of national strategy.” Marcelo de Assis from consultancy Wood Mackenzie questioned the logic of the state-controlled group returning to sectors it had left, as well as the government using it to advance a green agenda. “Is Petrobras the best company to do this?” he added. “Why would you move from profitable [exploration and production] to a more diverse company with lower profitability?” A more immediate concern for minority shareholders is how Petrobras charges for fuel — a politically sensitive topic in Brazil. Previous rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro fired three CEOs in less than a year and a half, following disputes over the issue. To fulfil Lula’s promise to “Brazilianise” fuel prices, management has ditched a practice of moving diesel and gasoline in line with the dollarised rates importers pay. Analysts have criticised the new pricing policy as unclear. “We still don’t know how it’s going to work when oil prices spike or the exchange rate depreciates,” said Luiz Carvalho at UBS BB. “Will they be able to increase fuel prices by the same amount?” Prates insisted international crude benchmarks will remain a factor in the calculations, with no handouts. “Petrobras does not subsidise anything,” he said.

"Milk mark-ups hit 30-year high at UK retailers ","Other charts of the week: US companies offshoring profits, leaders in solar power, and attitudes to social change","UK retailers’ mark-up on milk has hit a 30-year high, in an indication that companies have used the recent surge in inflation to pad out their profit margin on the consumer staple.  For decades, the retail price of a pint of milk was 25-30p higher than the farm gate price. But by March this year this mark-up had climbed to 44p, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.  Competition in the UK supermarket sector is usually a cut-throat affair, so the increased mark-up suggests that consumers are becoming more used to high inflation, economists said.  Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, called it a prime example of “profit-led inflation” — when consumers hear so many stories about rising costs that they accept an even bigger price rise as fair. However UK officials do not think this kind of “greedflation” is widespread or explains the overall pattern of high inflation. Excluding energy, UK corporate profits as a share of GDP were the lowest since 2009 last year. Competition authorities say they have no evidence of specific concerns in the grocery sector. Retailers’ margins are often squeezed again when consumers start to question whether price rises are fair, Donovan said. There is some indication this may have started in the UK milk trade: last month, big supermarkets began to cut their milk prices.  Delphine Strauss Our other charts of the week . . .   US multinational corporations offshore much of their profits to low-tax jurisdictions, according to data from the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). Seven of the top 10 most popular locations for offshoring have historically had an effective corporate tax rate of under 10 per cent. These countries accounted for over half of US companies’ foreign profits in 2019, compared with only around 30 per cent in 2000.  US policy incentivises offshoring as foreign assets face lower rates of tax than domestic assets, according to testimony to the US Senate Committee from Kimberly Clausing, professor of tax law and policy at the University of California.  The OECD is seeking to introduce a global minimum rate of corporate tax but the agreement — originally agreed between 136 countries in 2021 — has not been implemented because it is struggling to achieve sufficient support in the US Senate.  Amy Borrett  Americans are losing confidence in key economic leaders, just as their country faces a looming deadline to increase the government’s debt limit, and the threat of a possible economic recession.  Just 36 per cent of Americans surveyed by Gallup said they had a great deal or fair amount of confidence in Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell to do or to recommend the right thing for the US economy — the lowest level of confidence in a Fed chair for more than 20 years.  In the past year confidence has also declined for president Joe Biden and treasury secretary Janet Yellen, Gallup found.  Federica Cocco   Last year the Netherlands produced twice as much energy from solar power as the average EU country and 10 times more than Sweden, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. While solar energy still accounts for a small portion of the Netherlands’ electricity production — around 14 per cent — it has made rapid progress, doubling in the last two years. However, the Dutch government recently voted to phase out the country’s net metering system, which has been in place since 2004. The scheme created a financial incentive for households to invest in solar panels by awarding credits for surplus power.  Cleve Jones  Most people in advanced economies think their country would be better off by being open to change, rather than by sticking with traditional ways of life, according to a survey by Pew Research Center. As the world faces “rapid technological advances, economic upheaval and evolving values”, countries are embroiled in “heated political debates” about how to react to these types of change, Pew said. People in the Asia-Pacific region were particularly open to change, with more than seven in 10 holding this view in South Korea, Singapore and Australia.  The most notable exception was Greece, where most people said their country would be better off by holding on to its traditions. Younger people, those on the ideological left and those with higher education levels tended to embrace change more than older people, those on the ideological right and those with lower levels of education.

"Bank turmoil risks swaying ECB’s next rate decision, says Lagarde","President acknowledges jitters may limit rate-setters’ capacity to raise borrowing costs","Christine Lagarde has acknowledged that turmoil in the banking sector could force the European Central Bank to stop raising interest rates, should the recent market jitters hit lending to the eurozone’s businesses and households.  The ECB president told MEPs on Monday that eurozone banks had “very limited exposure” to Credit Suisse after it was taken over by its rival UBS in a weekend rescue deal that imposed losses on shareholders and wiped out SFr16bn of risky additional tier 1, or AT-1, debt. “We are not talking about billions [of exposure to Credit Suisse] here, we are talking about millions,” Lagarde said, adding that the eurozone banking system was “strong in terms of its aggregate capital and liquidity position”.  However, Lagarde warned that the turmoil risked worsening a recent contraction in the supply of credit.  “We are already seeing some tightening of financial conditions,” Lagarde said. “That might be accentuated by the tensions in the banking system and we will have to take that into account as part of the data we review as part of our next monetary policy decision.” Total eurozone lending by banks in the bloc contracted by €61bn between January and February, the biggest monthly decline since 2013.  The ECB said in January that its quarterly survey of lenders showed they had tightened their lending criteria on business loans by the most since the region’s sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Demand for mortgages fell at the fastest pace on record. Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here The tensions over the past two weeks were “not trivial”, Lagarde said, adding that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and crisis at Credit Suisse would “not be without repercussions”. She warned banks would need to prepare for “a potentially less favourable environment” owing to lower growth, rising funding costs and higher defaults. The ECB last week raised rates by half a percentage point, taking its deposit rate to 3 per cent, to tackle inflation that remains more than four times above its 2 per cent target.   The decision came despite calls for it to pause to see how the turmoil in the banking system plays out. Markets are pricing in a high chance that last week’s rate increase will be followed by a pause by the ECB at its next policy meeting on May 4. The US Federal Reserve and Bank of England are due to announce their rate decisions later this week. “There may come a point where central banks have no choice but to let inflationary concerns take a back seat and cut interest rates to shore up confidence,” said Vicky Redwood, a former Bank of England official who advises research group Capital Economics. However, Lagarde repeated that there was “no trade-off” between fighting inflation and maintaining financial stability. She said the ECB was “ready to respond as necessary” to preserve price and financial stability in the euro area. It was monitoring markets and its toolkit was “fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed”. She also said eurozone lenders were “well supervised”, with more than 2,200 banks in Europe covered by Basel III rules requiring them to maintain a minimum level of liquid assets. In the US, fewer banks are required to meet globally-agreed Basel standards, with only the biggest lenders needing to follow the rules. ","20.03.2023"
"BlackRock hunts ‘transformational’ opportunities as assets hit $9.1tn","Net income fell 19% year on year to $1.1bn in first quarter","BlackRock is hunting for “transformational” opportunities created by the recent banking turmoil and market dislocation, chief executive Larry Fink said on Friday as the world’s largest money manager reported assets under management had recovered to $9.1tn. “If there is an opportunity to do something transformational, we are going to be prepared to do it,” he told analysts. “How can we double down on what we’re doing with . . . technology. How can we build out our footprint globally at this time?” US regional banks, brokers and wealth managers are under pressure after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month sparked concerns about unrealised losses in their securities and loan portfolios and sent depositors scurrying to larger banks and money market funds.  BlackRock sent to a team to Switzerland to look at buying part of Credit Suisse before it was forcibly merged into UBS last month, and Fink obliquely referenced that decision, repeating what he said to his executives that week: “I said to be in the game, we must play the game. And so we’re in the game.” Fink bought what became its huge iShare’s exchange traded funds business when Barclays needed cash during the 2008 financial crisis, and it has done a series of smaller deals to expand the reach of its Aladdin technology business. The remarks on Friday came as BlackRock revealed that Fink took a 30 per cent pay cut, to $25.2mn in 2022, in recognition of “the firm’s decline in profitability” amid falling markets. Fink’s top leadership team, including the outgoing chief financial officer Gary Shedlin, saw similar reductions, in what the firm described as an effort to reduce the impact of lower earnings on the rest of its employees. BlackRock also reported that first quarter net income fell 19 per cent year on year to $1.1bn due to squeezed margins, subdued markets and lower performance fees. That translated to $7.64 a share. On an adjusted basis, EPS were $7.93, ahead of the $7.67 expected by analysts polled by Bloomberg. Revenue was down 10 per cent year on year to $4.2bn, with performance fees on its hedge funds and other alternative investment offerings down more than 40 per cent to $55mn, the money manager said. However, assets under management rose by $500bn in the quarter to $9.1tn, more than analysts had expected, although they are still well short of the peak of $10tn at the end of 2021. BlackRock also saw inflows of $110bn, with bond exchange traded funds performing particularly strongly.  BlackRock is among the first money managers to report for the quarter, with others in the sector under pressure to slash costs to compensate for lower earnings after a tough 2022. Its first-quarter operating margin of 33.9 per cent was down sharply from the same quarter last year, and slightly missed expectations. The inflows include $103bn to long-term funds and reflect a strong performance in the US where BlackRock has faced persistent attacks from state officials and legislatures in Republican states over its use of environment, social and governance factors in investing. Republican state treasurers have pulled out more than $4bn of government pension and treasury funds from the company on the grounds that it “boycotts” fossil fuel. BlackRock has hit back, denying those claims and arguing that it invests money the way its clients want. The company saw outflows from its cash management products in January and February but then $40bn in inflows in March as investors fled regional banks. BlackRock supplements its money management business with a chunky technology services business centred on its Aladdin risk management platform. Revenues in that division were basically flat year on year at $340mn, a bright spot when most other areas were down.  Kyle Sanders of Edward Jones said the results “exceed low expectations” and highlighted BlackRock’s “ability to sustain solid asset inflows in volatile markets” but warned that profit margins would reman under pressure until markets recovered.  BlackRock shares gained 3.1 per cent in New York on Friday.","14.04.2023"
"Four ways to make it easier to wind up failing banks","The resolution mechanism needs overhauling after the recent bank turmoil","“A globally active, systemically important bank cannot simply be wound up according to the ‘too big to fail’ plan,” Switzerland’s finance minister said last weekend. “Legally this would be possible. In practice, however, the economic damage would be considerable.” Fresh from crafting the rescue-by-takeover of Credit Suisse, Karin Keller-Sutter identified a clear problem. Bank resolution, the supposed gold standard of emergency regulatory action, cast in the heat of the great financial crisis of 2007-08, may be mainly decorative.  The bank resolution mechanism clearly needs overhauling before the next round of financial turmoil.  The digitised speed of the run on Silicon Valley Bank exposed deep problems with other emergency measures, such as deposit insurance and central bank funding. Days later, Keller-Sutter and colleagues were able to push Credit Suisse into the arms of UBS. In the process, though, they wiped out the contingent convertible bonds that were supposed to rank above equity in the established hierarchy of liabilities. The “coco”, an important new tool in the post-2008 regulatory box, was shown to be unfit for purpose — or at least prone to the regulator’s whim. Four main adjustments would make orderly resolution of an imminently failing bank easier to achieve. As US president Joe Biden suggested this week, regulators need firstly to factor the impact of sharp interest rate rises on balance sheets into their stress testing of institutions ahead of periods of monetary tightening, and bring midsized banks back under the stronger Dodd-Frank rules applied to systemically important peers. Supervisors and central banks also need to recognise the sheer speed with which an online run on the bank can develop. A 24/7 crisis requires a 24/7 response. It is no longer enough for the US Federal Reserve to limit opening of its discount window to a few hours a day. The Fed might also consider widening the range of securities that can be pledged as collateral against loans from the window and make permanent the new Bank Term Funding Program it set up in the wake of the SVB implosion.  Third, deposit insurance regimes need to be adjusted, since the perception at the moment is that all deposits are de facto guaranteed. This is delicate. A permanent backstop would increase moral hazard, giving licence to banks to pursue risky strategies. A temporary backstop of all deposits, as suggested by Sheila Bair, former chair of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, would require careful design to avoid any possible runs on fragile banks as the guarantee period drew to a close. What is clear is that if mutualised deposit guarantee schemes’ cover widens, banks must pay a higher price to participate. Rules on the assets backing banks’ deposits must be stricter, and must be fortified against any attempts to loosen them later.  Finally, after the Credit Suisse rescue, bank supervisors must codify the investor hierarchy and ensure it is applied consistently across jurisdictions. The SVB and Credit Suisse cases have drowned out banks’ calls to loosen the rules and should curb governments’ desire to use laxer regulation as a competitive tool. A safer, if less profitable, banking system built on fortress-like capital structures is again the goal.  But the recent turmoil is a reminder that when banks teeter, local politics and pragmatism tend to trump purism. Such ad hoc decision-making fuels further uncertainty. More than a year went by between the first credit crunch tremors in 2007 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Now would be a good time to reinforce the predictable framework that was meant to avoid a repeat of that crisis, before the next quake. ​Letter in response to this editorial comment: It’s for legislators, not regulators, to codify EU investor hierarchy​ / ​From Amélie Champsaur, Partner, Cleary Gottlieb, Paris, France","02.04.2023"
"Credit Suisse launches lawsuit against Zurich finance blog","Swiss bank calls for removal of parts of articles published by Inside Paradeplatz since July 27","Credit Suisse has launched a lawsuit against a popular Zurich finance blog over what it claims are unvetted and abusive comments hosted under stories about the Swiss bank since chief executive Ulrich Körner took charge. Lawyers acting on behalf of Credit Suisse submitted the 256-page claim against Inside Paradeplatz and its publisher, Lukas Hässig, in the Commercial Court of Zurich earlier this month. “I’ve been sued before, but this is the biggest so far,” Hässig told the Financial Times after the suit became public on Monday. “I have to fight it — what other choice do I have?”  The suit is calling for the removal of parts of* 52 articles on the blog published between July 27 — the date Körner was announced as the new chief executive — and October 28 that relate to Credit Suisse, as well as the comments from readers that appear under the articles. Credit Suisse has set the costs for the case at SFr300,000 ($322,000) and is also pursuing the blog for all the profit it has generated since July 27, plus 5 per cent interest. In a statement, Credit Suisse said it was asking a judge to rule on the “legality of reader comments” on the blog.  “We are taking this step to protect our employees, who are regularly the subject of abusive and disparaging comments on the blog,” it said. In the lawsuit, Credit Suisse said it supported a “free and critical press”. But it added that through the blog’s coverage the bank management team was “showered with insults and . . . written off to death, customers and employees are even actively encouraged to leave the bank”. “The countless anonymous online commentators kept so amused in this way delight in the topic by venting their outright disdain on the blog for fun or out of frustration, which in turn provokes countless reader reactions and thus leads to more clicks,” it added.  Hässig told the FT he was a “fan of being liberal with all the comments”, adding: “It’s my responsibility in the end. I do delete from time to time, but I believe in free speech in an extensive way.”  He was also sued last month by Ringier, a Swiss publishing house. Bankers in Zurich have long complained about the coverage they receive from Inside Paradeplatz, which mixes scurrilous gossip and contentious commentary with insider tip-offs. But the blog is essential daily reading for Switzerland’s close-knit financial community. In June, the blog caused a storm when it ran a story saying Boston-based State Street was said to be planning a SFr23bn ($25bn) takeover bid for Credit Suisse, based on a single source. While both banks later denied the story, following the initial report and press coverage of it Credit Suisse shares rose 12 per cent and State Street stock fell 5 per cent. In 2015, Credit Suisse attempted to sue Inside Paradeplatz over three articles Hässig ran that compared the Swiss bank to Fifa, world football’s governing body that was at the time at the centre of a global corruption scandal.  The blog was also the subject of legal action from UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, in 2019 over descriptions of Markus Diethelm, the bank’s then legal chief. Diethelm is currently general counsel at Credit Suisse and has taken a hard line on fighting and settling legacy lawsuits surrounding the bank.

"China’s top lenders tout limited exposure to western banking crisis ","Beijing’s biggest banks encouraged by stress tests against US and European risk","China’s biggest banks say they have escaped unscathed from the financial crisis in the US and Europe, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse. China’s top lenders — Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China — have all reported there was no direct damage to their books from last month’s emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS and failures in the US banking sector.  “Even from an indirect or spillover effect perspective, the impact [to China’s banking sector] is very limited,” said Ji Zhihong, vice-president of the country’s second-largest bank CCB at a briefing last week, when all the main banks reported strong earnings.  China’s banks and other financial institutions are still reporting to regulators the results of stress-testing against what they see as a potential minefield of new risks that includes exposure to European and regional US banks. According to staff carrying out the tests, only limited exposure has been found. The scrutiny highlights lingering market concerns over Chinese banks’ cash management and liquidity against the backdrop of growing geopolitical tension and financial system turbulence. Zhang Yi, vice-president of Bank of China, which has the largest amount of foreign exposure, said that while his bank had not been hit by the crisis, it still planned to adjust offshore assets and deposits. “No matter what the reasons were for the problematic foreign institutions, it eventually results in stress and runs on deposits . . . we’ll make sure that maturity and pricing between assets and deposits has no big mismatch,” he said. The biggest lesson for China’s financial system planners and regulators is not to “create the environment” that puts banks into a similar position as SVB and Credit Suisse, said Chen Long, co-founder of Beijing-based research company Plenum.  “The radical change of monetary policy is a very bad idea. If you have to raise interest rates by 300 [basis points] in a year, that is definitely going to cause a lot of strain on the banking system. Some banks, if they are well managed, have ways to prepare. But not everyone is well managed.”  ICBC, the world’s biggest bank, reported net profit of Rmb360bn ($52bn) for 2022, up 3.5 per cent on the prior year. The other top banks reported similarly robust — or better — profit growth.  The net interest margin, a key gauge of bank profitability, remained steady or eased slightly for the top banks, suggesting resilience in their credit books. The results came despite subdued economic growth in China and during an unprecedented downturn and high levels of corporate debt in the property sector, a major driver of the economy.  The banking crisis has dented China’s faith in the wisdom of regulators in Europe and the US. Chinese regulators had been following measures such as requiring banks to set up “living wills” after bankruptcy or takeover events. “The framework of regulating banks globally now looks insufficient at least,” Chen said.  “The irony is that the Swiss are viewed as leaders in how to regulate banks. Then Credit Suisse, the [country’s] second-largest bank failed,” he added.  Despite better than expected financial results, China’s top lenders each warned of persistent risks, stemming mostly from the property sector. At CCB, the non-performing loan ratio for property nearly doubled year on year. China’s real estate sector has been rocked by a series of developer bond and loan defaults, as stringent debt control on the real estate sector choked the industry’s liquidity lines.  “The property sector will take time to recover, so the hangover on asset quality will last for a while,” said Liu Jiandong, chief risk officer at the Bank of China.","02.04.2023"
"US companies in distress turn to debt exchanges to dodge bankruptcy","Private equity backers push out-of-court restructurings to preserve their stakes when businesses default","Distressed US companies are increasingly resorting to debt restructurings to avoid expensive bankruptcy proceedings, but many borrowers ultimately end up in court anyway — with their deals amounting to little more than “can-kicking” exercises. Almost three-quarters of US corporate debt defaults last year were out-of-court “distressed exchanges”, where a company offers creditors assets worth less than their original bonds or loans, according to a report by Moody’s this month. That is up from roughly half in 2020, the rating agency said. Moody’s predicts that far-reaching private equity ownership of companies with very weak ratings will further fuel the growth of distressed exchanges because this type of restructuring can protect such backers’ investments.  “Private equity sponsors heavily favour distressed exchanges as a debt restructuring tool of choice because it helps them sidestep bankruptcy and preserves their equity,” Moody’s said. However, many businesses default again following such restructurings. The “re-default” rate monitored by Moody’s currently stands at 47 per cent. Some companies are “just kicking the can” with distressed exchanges and merely delaying an inevitable bankruptcy, said Sinjin Bowron, head of high-yield and leveraged loans at Beach Point Capital Management. “In the event that there’s a distressed exchange at a company, not only are you potentially losing asset value as a lender” he said. “But also, if the company is having operational difficulties, then it doesn’t necessarily fix those problems.” Of the companies tracked by Moody’s that defaulted a second time, the majority ended up in bankruptcy. Mattress company Serta Simmons entered bankruptcy proceedings in January. KKR-backed Envision Healthcare is also reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy, according to the Wall Street Journal, while retailer Bed, Bath and Beyond — not backed by private equity — filed for Chapter 11 on Sunday after a distressed exchange in 2022.  Envision did not respond to a request for comment.  The accelerating trend underscores the challenges faced by distressed companies that face a combination of rising borrowing costs and a slowing economy. These difficulties, and investor scrutiny of such businesses, are likely to intensify this year against a backdrop of rising recession fears.  Rating agency S&P sees the US junk-grade default rate reaching 4 per cent by December, from a rate of 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to March. Moody’s anticipates a US rate of 5.6 per cent by next March, up sharply from its own figure of 2.7 per cent as of March 31. As more companies are forced to renege on their borrowings, some may opt for exchanges because they believe “the business overall is sustainable” with a lower debt load, said Matt Mish, head of credit strategy at UBS. “Heading into a more difficult financial environment, they want to resize the capital structure,” he added. The proliferation of distressed exchanges follows a dealmaking frenzy when buyout groups took advantage of cheap borrowing costs to pile leverage on to lowly rated companies with already creaking balance sheets, funding billions of dollars’ worth of mergers and acquisitions. In recent years, much of this debt has comprised leveraged loans, instruments sold by “junk” grade businesses, whose coupons move with prevailing interest rates. These were considered attractive when monetary policy was ultra-loose — with issuance roughly doubling to $615bn between 2019 and 2021 as interest rates plunged early in the Covid pandemic, according to data provider LCD — but have lost their appeal as the Federal Reserve embarked on its most aggressive campaign of interest rate rises in decades to tame inflation. High-yield or sub-investment-grade corporate bond issuance also picked up as interest rates were slashed after the outbreak of Covid, reaching $465bn, compared with $263bn in 2019, according to Refinitiv data. Historically, unsecured bonds — debt not backed by company assets — were usually restructured in distressed exchanges. However, since the start of the pandemic, the rising number of defaulting “loan-only” borrowers without bonds has changed that dynamic.   At first glance, distressed exchanges can be appealing to lenders who typically recover a greater proportion of their outlay than they would in a bankruptcy, according to Julia Chursin, senior analyst at Moody’s. But the current repeat rate for defaults means that often, “you get hit once, then a second time — your recovery rate deteriorates”, Chursin said. Historical data for unsecured bonds indicates that if a company goes through a distressed exchange, then files for bankruptcy, “[creditors’] losses can accumulate and it can be worse than just filing for bankruptcy”.","27.04.2023"
"Dollar bounces back as US economy defies doubters","Currency picks up after falling more than 11% since October","The dollar has rebounded from a 10-month low as investors push up their forecasts for US interest rates after signs of stubborn inflation and unexpectedly strong economic activity.  The world’s most important reserve currency rose to a 20-year high in September but tumbled 11.2 per cent over the following four months as US inflation declined from a multi-decade peak, allowing the Federal Reserve to slow the pace at which it raised interest rates towards the end of 2022. Tamer rate rises and the prospect of steady or even falling rates in 2023 removed one of the currency’s key supports. However, February has begun with a flurry of economic data suggesting the world’s biggest economy remains in rude health, pushing the dollar back up by 3 per cent against a basket of six other leading currencies since the start of the month and erasing January’s decline.   The US last month added more than half a million jobs, almost triple the consensus forecast, while inflation fell to 6.4 per cent, a smaller decrease than expected. “The inflation report has ruined markets’ nice little disinflationary plan,” said Florian Ielpo, multi-asset portfolio manager at Lombard Odier, with central banks likely to maintain their upward pressure on rates as a result.   Jordan Rochester, a foreign exchange strategist at Nomura, said February began “with everyone in the macroeconomic community assuming the dollar would sell off against the euro and the yen. Since then almost every single US data point has come in stronger than expected, and markets have slowly come around to what the Fed has been saying for a long time, that rates have further to go and will be kept on hold for a while.” Benchmark US interest rates stand in a range of 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent. At the start of February, futures markets were pricing in a rates peak close to 4.9 per cent, with two cuts in the second half of the year taking borrowing costs to about 4.4 per cent heading into 2024.  Just over two weeks later, markets had shifted to predict a peak at 5.28 per cent, ending the year just above 5 per cent following a single cut. Still, some investors doubt the dollar rally has much longer left to run. The haven currency is likely to continue to rise this quarter but “resume its downward trajectory as global growth and risk sentiment improve,” said analysts at UBS. ","18.02.2023"
"SVB’s collapse was one thing, Credit Suisse’s quite another","If a run on a liquid, well-capitalised bank is possible, it could happen to anyone","The 1996 slasher movie Scream sets out three rules to survive a horror movie: you can never have sex, you can never drink or do drugs and you can never, under any circumstances, say “I’ll be right back”. Among recent bank failures, Silvergate did the deed, Signature Bank got wasted on its parents’ Tia Maria and Silicon Valley Bank did both before popping outside to check the strange noise in the garden. Having all committed obvious banking sins, all were duly punished. International bankers and regulators, observing the recent fiasco in US banking, are scornful. “Poor management, poor supervision, poor regulation. The Fed has acknowledged as much,” one told me recently. They are not unduly worried about the same thing happening on their patch. But there is one collapse the banking community takes differently; one that has everyone worried, because it casts doubt on the fundamentals of financial regulation. The failure of Credit Suisse really is a horror story. What happened to Silicon Valley Bank — the most symbolic of this round of US bank failures — is well understood. It is a tale as old as banking. SVB gathered billions of dollars in uninsured, short-term deposits from start-up companies. It invested them in highly rated, long-term securities. Interest rates went up. The value of the long-term securities went down. Depositors realised and demanded their money back. Borrow short, lend long, see you in hell. The only wonder is how sophisticated people let it happen. Silvergate, Signature and First Republic are variations on the theme, with added crypto.  Credit Suisse — forcibly sold to UBS, its fierce local rival, a week after Silicon Valley Bank’s trip to banking Valhalla — was different. Yes, the Swiss lender got involved with all sorts of questionable characters, from Lex Greensill, the financier of hypothetical invoices, to Bill Hwang of Archegos, who was as long and wrong as any trader in recent history. Yes, it needed painful changes to its business model, with profitability under strain for some years to come. But Credit Suisse did not make a mad bet on interest rates. There was no read-across from SVB. It had a solid balance sheet and a valuable core business franchise. In horror movie terms, Credit Suisse might not be the heroine, but it was a clumsy best friend who had followed the rules and done nothing to tempt the killer’s attention. Yet even though events in the US offered no new information about the state of Credit Suisse, the Zurich bank’s depositors still ran, which is what has got every thoughtful banker and regulator in the world looking over their shoulder. The post-2009 banking settlement involved high levels of capital, to protect against losses, and rules on liquidity, to deal with sudden demands for cash. Silicon Valley Bank did dumb stuff and its depositors were at risk. But if Credit Suisse can suffer a run even though it was liquid and well capitalised, then the same thing can happen to any other bank, anywhere, at any time. The bank runs in March and April were unusually fast. Silicon Valley Bank lost 25 per cent of its deposits in a day and was due to lose another 62 per cent the next day, if it did not close. Silvergate and First Republic lost half their deposits in a couple of weeks. Several factors have been put forward to explain this — new technology making it easy to withdraw electronically; the presence of large, uninsured corporate depositors; and the spread of rumour and misinformation on social media — but none is wholly satisfactory. According to Jonathan Rose, a historian at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, rapid electronic withdrawals were an issue as early as the run on Continental Illinois in 1984. Rose quotes an account by regulator Irvine Sprague, who wrote that the banking halls were quiet, but in the back office “the employees knew what was happening as withdrawal order after order moved on the wire, bleeding Continental to death”. Perhaps ultra-rich clients moving cash on their mobile phones helped to kill Credit Suisse, but this cannot be the whole story. Banks with large volumes of uninsured deposits are not new either, notes Rose. Only 6 per cent of SVB’s deposits were insured, which is very low, but comparable with 15 per cent at Continental Illinois. Most of Credit Suisse’s private banking deposits were outside insurance, but they always have been. The concentration of deposits from the tech industry at SVB, Silvergate and Signature was somewhat unusual, but that did not apply to Credit Suisse at all. Social media is one new force in a banking crisis. Facebook began in 2004 and Twitter in 2006, but they were not yet global and all pervasive during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Social media connections clearly fuelled the run on SVB, but a crucial topic for regulators to understand is how Credit Suisse’s private banking clients around the world got the message to flee. What if, in the future, a similar run starts based on complete falsehoods about a solvent bank?  Ultimately, the question Credit Suisse raises is whether any amount of capital and liquidity can make a risk-taking bank safe, boosting the case for narrow banking or wider access to central bank money. The momentum of innovation is already in that direction and it truly would be a horror story for commercial banks.

"Deals between European private equity firms halve year-on-year as rising rates hit","Companies seeking to exit investments struggle to agree on prices in negotiations with rivals","Deals between private equity firms in Europe have plunged to their lowest levels since the Covid-19 pandemic as the buyout game of pass-the-parcel is hit by rising debt costs and investors’ concerns about the economic outlook. In the first three months of this year the value of deals struck between rival private equity firms in Europe fell to its lowest point since the second quarter of 2020, according to data provider PitchBook, as buyout houses seeking to exit investments struggled to agree on prices. Just €16.8bn worth of companies were traded between investment firms — less than half the value of deals struck over the same period last year. Initial public offerings had their second worst quarter over the same time period, PitchBook data shows.  “It’s a very tough time to exit anything and sponsor to sponsor deals are the most acutely impacted,” Hugh MacArthur, global chair of Bain & Co’s private equity team said. “You have the macro uncertainty and, by the way, debt costs a lot more, so unless you are willing to ignore that then it is very difficult to get these deals done.”  The practice of private equity firms selling assets to one another has boomed over the past decade as the era of low interest rates let firms raise record sums which they were under pressure to deploy. Valuations remain inflated and the cost of borrowing has gone up Saba Nazar, Bank of America The peak for intra-PE deals came in 2021 when, buoyed by the economic rebound of reopening after pandemic lockdowns, €173bn of companies were traded between buyout firms.  Some companies passed between PE hands four or five times at ever higher valuations. Vincent Mortier of asset manager Amundi likened the practice to a Ponzi scheme. Last June, Mortier warned that firms would face a reckoning in the coming years. With PE firms now baulking at buying assets from each other, deals are at risk of falling apart as sellers are unwilling to compromise on price. In recent weeks, two prominent auction processes for private equity-owned companies — veterinary clinic chain VetPartners and biometrics technology company IDEMIA — have attracted muted interest from rival firms, according to people familiar with the matter.   Both companies received fewer offers than expected as potential private equity buyers were put off by high pricing expectations and increased borrowing costs, the people said. Talks were ongoing with at least one prospective buyer of VetPartners, one of the people added. Both groups declined to comment.  Eurazeo’s sale of French insurance company Groupe Premium is facing similar difficulties, other people said. Eurazeo declined to comment. Groupe Premium did not reply to a request for comment.   The slowdown means buyout groups are struggling to cash in on their bets. As a consequence, firms seeking to raise new funds from their backers are having difficulty as investors typically like to have cash returned to them before backing managers again.  Investors in private equity funds have also been hit by the so-called denominator effect whereby publicly traded assets fall in value in real time but private assets are not marked down as much — so an increasing proportion of investors’ portfolios is held in private markets.  This phenomenon has amplified the need for investors to receive cash back from the firms they invest with, before they are able to make fresh commitments.  “There is no equilibrium on valuation,” said Simona Maellare, global co-head of the alternative capital group at UBS. “What limited partners are caring about is distributions and the easiest deals to do are deals to sell to another PE.”  “One of the biggest problems for sponsors now is the LBO math doesn’t work — valuations remain inflated and the cost of borrowing has gone up,” said Saba Nazar, co-head of global financial sponsors at Bank of America.  The need to return money to investors is forcing firms to get creative. One tactic is so-called “continuation funds”. These enable firms to move assets from one fund they manage to another, without having to sell or list the asset.  Swedish firm EQT, for example, is building out an in-house team to help do these types of deals. This week European buyout firm Triton announced it had sold four portfolio companies it owned to a continuation fund in a €1.6 billion deal.  Private equity firms have also found some success in selling assets to corporate buyers or cash-rich sovereign wealth funds. Last month Bridgepoint sold its dialysis clinic chain Diaverum to a health venture backed by an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. “A lot of sovereign wealth funds are awash with cash and they are keen to deploy it in the right businesses where they can make a clear return,” Nazar said.  Those without access to those pools of capital hope that the world’s leading central banks stop raising rates sooner rather than later, so that they can avoid crystallising losses by selling at lower valuations or losing out on deals completely. “Everybody can survive a year without doing too much but [18 months] or two years is a long period of time,” MacArthur said.","07.05.2023"
"Defaults on US junk loans expected to climb as rate rises squeeze earnings","Analysts expect leveraged loan market to feel the pinch to meet repayments","The Federal Reserve’s most aggressive pace of interest rate increases in decades is set to trigger a surge of defaults over the next two years in the $1.4tn market for risky corporate loans, according to Wall Street banks and rating agencies. Analysts across the industry forecast that defaults will at least double from today’s relatively low 1.6 per cent. But the disparity is stark, with some firms warning clients that anywhere from one-in-20 to one-in-10 loans could default next year.  Deutsche Bank expects the default rate on leveraged loans in the US to climb to 5.6 per cent next year — up from 1.6 per cent — before rising to 11.3 per cent in 2024. That would leave defaults close to all-time highs set in 2009.  Strategists at UBS forecast a default rate for low-grade loans of 9 per cent in 2023 alone. Those predictions come as analysts anticipate that the Fed’s efforts to tame inflation through aggressive interest rate rises will pressure the “junk”-rated companies that swelled their debt piles with cheap money during the pandemic era. The floating-rate coupons of leveraged loans made them particularly attractive to borrowers when central banks cut borrowing costs to close to zero in response to the Covid-19 crisis, because the loan payments drop when prevailing interest rates fall. “It’s really the US loan market that we think has the most fundamental risk this cycle because that’s where the floating rate debt has combined with aggressive releveraging,” said Steve Caprio, head of European and US credit strategy at Deutsche Bank Research. Leveraged loans typically finance companies with high debt levels and poor credit ratings, and have been a mainstay for private equity groups seeking to fund their buyouts. New loan sales in the US surged to $615bn in 2021, according to data provider LCD, as companies and buyout firms took advantage of ultra-low interest rates. This was the highest annual number since LCD’s full-year records began in 2000.  However, the Fed has lifted interest rates rapidly this year to a target range of 3.75 to 4 per cent, and markets are pricing in expectations of a peak of about 5 per cent next spring. In turn, fears have intensified that debt issuers most immediately exposed to those rate rises will struggle under the weight of higher borrowing costs, leading some to miss their payments.  Compounding the pain, Wall Street banks are broadly anticipating a US recession in 2023 — potentially dealing a blow to corporate earnings just as businesses find it more expensive to reimburse creditors.Leveraged loan issuance has already slowed this year to its most lethargic pace since 2010 — totalling just $225bn up to December 7, according to LCD. The leveraged loan market is “very sensitive to the Fed tightening”, said Matt Mish, head of credit strategy at UBS, “particularly lower-rated credit, because you don’t have a lot of these companies that fully hedge the interest rate exposure”. Companies rated at B or CCC, which sit at the lower end of credit agencies’ quality spectrum, now account for three-quarters of the leveraged loan market, compared with 62 per cent 10 years ago, according to UBS. Caprio cited the technology and software industries as most at risk. “[Here] you’re starting to see multiples decline in the equity markets and you’re starting to see some investors question just how sticky these revenues are from that sector.”  The bigger fear is that rising defaults will spread across other parts of the US debt market. UBS’s credit strategy team sees US leveraged loans as “the weakest link in US credit”, predicting that credit deterioration for the asset class could have a knock-on impact on appetite from their biggest buyers — via vehicles called collateralised loan obligations.  CLOs make up most of the demand for leveraged loans, packaging these up and selling them on to investors in various risk-categorised tranches. However, the definition and scope of defaults from data providers vary, contributing to a range of forecasts.  Analysts at JPMorgan predict a default rate of 3.5 per cent for US leveraged loans in 2023, and expect this to rise to 4 per cent in 2024, assuming a gentle economic slowdown. “The loan product is expected to feel more fundamental headwinds from the immediate transmission of rates and more aggressive capital market trends,” they wrote in an outlook note.  Using a narrower interpretation, an index of leveraged loans tracked by Morningstar and trade organisation LSTA could reach a default rate of 2.5 per cent by next September, up from 0.78 per cent in October 2022. “We see evidence that cushions built up after the 2020 recession are thinning,” analysts at S&P Global Ratings wrote in an assessment of the index, “but so far, they still appear to be supporting issuers in the index”. Nick Kraemer, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, puts the overall default rate for speculative-grade US debt at 3.75 per cent by next September on a trailing 12-month basis — up from 1.6 per cent in the same month of this year. That is lower than the long-term average of 4.1 per cent, he said. Still, S&P’s “pessimistic scenario” is for junk-rated US debt to endure a default rate of 6 per cent. “Much will depend on the depth or duration of the recession,” it concluded.","13.12.2022"
"Credit Suisse at a make-or-break moment","A radical restructuring could give the scandal-plagued bank new momentum — but deep losses in 2022 could yet prove to be the last straw","The renowned banker Michael Klein has a new deal in his sights.  Compared with his record of megadeals bringing together Barclays and Lehman Brothers, Dow Chemical and Dupont, and Glencore and Xstrata, this will be a small one.  But if successful, it might do something few in the investment banking industry think is possible: take the dysfunctional, scandal-plagued lender Credit Suisse and turn it into a banking powerhouse.  Klein, a former Citibank M&A banker, is on the verge of signing an agreement to sell his eponymous advisory boutique firm to Credit Suisse for a sum in the “low nine figures”, says a person involved in the negotiations.  The takeover is the central plank in a radical restructuring plan that the Zurich-headquartered lender hopes will bring to an end an era of stumbling from crisis to crisis and open up a profitable new future.  The plan, unveiled by the Swiss bank’s management team last year, would see Klein become chief executive of a new entity, CS First Boston, merging his firm and Credit Suisse’s spun-off capital markets and advisory business. “Michael Klein is an extraordinary banker — he is the most unbelievable client guy,” says a Credit Suisse executive. “We just hired a master of the universe to run our investment bank.”  Yet for all the enthusiasm surrounding the deal, Credit Suisse is now firmly in the last chance saloon.   On Thursday, it publishes arguably the most important set of financial results in its 167-year history. It has already warned the market that it is on course for its second consecutive annual loss following a damaging exodus of wealth management clients in October in response to intense social media speculation about its financial health. Chair Axel Lehmann has described 2022 as a “horrifying year” for the bank.  But if the size of the annual loss is significantly higher than the SFr7.2bn ($7.8bn) estimated by analysts and there is little sign that outflows have reversed — as the bank’s management insists they have — the bank’s capital and liquidity levels could take a hit. That would be a warning sign to shareholders and credit rating agencies. “We don’t want any massive surprises,” says Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of the Ethos Foundation, which represents about 5 per cent of Credit Suisse shareholders. “The worst scenario would be if the board was forced to reconsider its strategy — that would be really catastrophic.” Credit Suisse shares hit an all-time low in December at SFr2.70, and although they have since risen to about SFr3.20, they are still down more than 60 per cent over the past year. The bank’s market price trades at close to an 80 per cent discount to its book value, compared to a 20 per cent premium for fierce rival UBS. Following a series of downgrades over the past year, Credit Suisse’s debt teeters perilously one notch above junk status, as rated by S&P, and two above by Moody’s and Fitch. The latter two have a negative outlook on the group. Should Credit Suisse slip into non-investment grade territory — an ignominy that even Deutsche Bank avoided during its lowest points as Europe’s basket-case bank — the Swiss lender’s restructuring would be put in jeopardy, as well as its future as a going concern.  Within the bank’s corporate and executives boards — where the plan was formulated last year — there is a feeling that if the strategy does not succeed, the business is unlikely to survive without being broken up or sold off, according to people involved in the discussions.  In such a scenario, UBS remains on alert for a “999” emergency rescue call from the Swiss government, says a person familiar with the bank’s internal war-gaming. “The country is committed to a two-bank model, but we would be naive not to prepare for it.”  In that eventuality, UBS would prefer to take over the entire Credit Suisse group and make its own decisions about which business lines and staff to retain, without the complications from half-completed, third-party negotiations with Klein, the person adds.  The deal that could remake Credit Suisse hinges on what happens in the next few days. A steep task Even if Credit Suisse were to come through this week’s results unscathed, its new management team — having undergone an overhaul over the past year — still faces a fiendishly difficult task in executing the grand plan. While chief executive Ulrich Körner — who was catapulted into the role last summer — has said it is a three-year project, those working on the details concede it could take up to five years or longer to pull off. The plan is centred around focusing the bank more on wealth management and cutting its exposure to riskier investment banking. The part that has received most attention so far is the CS First Boston spin-off, whose name harks back to the group’s dealmaking heyday in the 1980s.  Credit Suisse executives argue the new venture will cause huge disruption on Wall Street, with a business nimble enough to compete with fleet-footed boutique advisory firms — which have picked up market share over the past decade — but with the heft of a global bank’s balance sheet behind it.  “The idea is to create a big boutique, two to three times the size of the next largest, but with the firepower of the monster investment banks,” says a person involved in planning the restructure. “To me, this model is the future of banking.”  Credit Suisse executives appear to have already overcome the first hurdle to launching the business, albeit a fairly low one. Last month, the bank cut a deal with the owner of the First Boston trademark, an unrelated business, to enable it to use the brand for the new venture.  But the scant details Credit Suisse has made public so far have been met with scepticism by rivals. “They have the name, but do they have the right people?” asks the head of a rival investment bank, who was doubtful that the plan would work.  “It will take time and money to attract the right people. The advisory boutique model is a much more people-focused business than broader investment banking. That is the most important thing to get right.” The spin-off has not been without controversy, with the bank’s board and management facing questions over the process of deciding the investment bank’s future amid accusations of conflicts of interest. A small subset of the board was tasked with finding a solution to the investment bank last summer. One of the three members was Klein, who had been on the Credit Suisse board since 2018. Key moments: The Greensill scandalMARCH 2021Credit Suisse was forced to suspend $10bn of investment funds tied to the specialist finance firm Greensill Capital, trapping the savings of up to 1,000 of its wealthiest clients. Ever since, the bank has been involved in a painstaking process of reclaiming its customers’ funds through insurance claims and lawsuits. After the decision was reached on separating parts of the investment bank, Klein was tasked with leading the new venture, a decision Credit Suisse insiders insist was made by Körner. Klein has since stepped back from the board. “Carving out the investment bank is wrought with issues,” says an analyst covering Credit Suisse. “It’s very ugly from a governance perspective; the guy was an insider and now he is going to run the spun-off bank.” Credit Suisse executives have said the bank “shielded” itself from “perceived conflicts of interest”, with Klein recusing himself from final decisions on his personal involvement. Yet his role in securing investment from Saudi Arabia for Credit Suisse’s capital raise and his personal benefit from selling his boutique to the bank have also raised eyebrows. A person involved describes the negotiations over the deal as “quite adversarial” at times. Klein has hired law firm Paul, Weiss to be in his corner — known for charging more than $2,000 an hour, and for representing ​​Sam Bankman-Fried in the FTX bankruptcy case. “Klein has negotiated a terrific deal for himself,” says the head of a rival investment bank. “This is a great deal for the banker, but not so much for the bank.” Building the new bank The big next step in putting the new investment bank together is defining its strategy and structure, a process that requires aligning lots of moving parts. This task has been chiefly left to Klein, who has to get the balance right between what Credit Suisse is traditionally good at and what business mix will help it compete with rivals. Key moments: Archegos collapsesMARCH 2021The collapse of Archegos Capital under the weight of its own heavily leveraged stock market bets caused a $5.5bn loss for Credit Suisse, marking the biggest trading loss in its history. Credit Suisse provided prime broking services to the family office, along with several other investment banks, which collectively lost more than $10bn.  Leveraged finance, along with securitised products, has been an area where Credit Suisse has excelled historically, but both require a weighty capital underpin, which the business is trying to move away from. Klein’s personal strength as an M&A dealmaker is not matched by Credit Suisse’s own standing in the market, where it is viewed as a second-tier player on Wall Street.   Setting the strategy will depend on ensuring the right staff stay on with the new venture, as well as poaching talented bankers from rivals. In order to do so, Klein will offer equity stakes in CS First Boston, which is planned to be partly listed in the next few years. Pulling all these threads together will depend on how much capital can be raised from investors in the new business, though any investor committing capital would want to see well-defined plans. Bankers coming from rivals would also want a clear indication about how much equity they would get in the business. “I think it is very hard to start these types of conversations with people until you have a strategy to explain to them, and he can’t have a strategy until he has the capital in place,” says the head of the financial advisory group at another Wall Street bank.  Credit Suisse is seeking to tempt investors with a five-year exchangeable debt security that will yield 6 per cent a year and convert into equity when CS First Boston lists, according to a sales document describing the venture as a “super boutique” that was first reported by Reuters. Key moments: Uli the knife takes overJULY 2022Ulrich Körner was the surprise choice to take over from departing chief executive Thomas Gottstein. The appointment of the man nicknamed “Uli the knife” during his 11 years as a UBS executive was announced at the same time the board said it would begin drawing up a radical plan to restructure the bank.  Another key feature of the master plan that has been little discussed outside Credit Suisse is the creation of a so-called “bad bank” — known internally as the capital release unit — tasked with winding down high-risk business lines and exposures that are seen as expensive and peripheral to the group. Against this backdrop is a vast cost-cutting drive targeting SFr2.5bn or 15 per cent of the group’s spending. The effort involves everything from rationalising IT systems to selling office buildings and luxury hotels, and includes shedding 9,000 roles from the bank’s 52,000 workforce. The bank’s first wave of redundancies at the end of last year focused on the US, where labour laws make it easier to fire staff, but negotiations are already under way with investment bankers in Europe that could see more than 10 per cent of roles going this year. The lay-offs are undermining some of the planning, affecting staff morale and leading to a spate of defections by senior bankers. CS First Boston will be centred in New York and retain some investment bankers in Europe and Asia to give the business global scale. But staff outside the US are unclear what role they will play in the new venture, if any. “The reality is it’s difficult to imagine where we fit in; we are all a little bit in waiting mode,” says one Europe-based Credit Suisse investment banker. “The direction of travel is quite evident. European activities are going to be slimmed down — the extent of that is going to be defined over time.” Key moments: Trending downwardsOCTOBER 2022Rumours on social media over the financial health of Credit Suisse led to clients pulling a 10th of the assets held in the bank’s wealth business, on a scale experienced by rival UBS throughout an entire year during the financial crisis.  In New York, meanwhile, staff who have been told they are likely to be kept on for the new venture are unclear about what financial packages they will receive. “They have no idea of what equity they will be getting, but the alternative is that they will be looking elsewhere,” says a person with knowledge of the process.  “No one knows when it launches, how it launches, will they get a salary in the first two months, who is financing it. They ask about what equity they will get and are told ‘we will talk about that later’.”  Rivals circling Waiting in the wings as Credit Suisse prepares to report its seventh quarterly loss out of the past nine on Thursday are other suitors interested in parts or all of its business.  Beyond UBS, they include Deutsche Bank, which is struggling to grow its own wealth management operations and is still too reliant on its volatile trading business for revenue. Another rumoured party is French lender BNP Paribas, which last week closed the $16.3bn sale of its Bank of the West US division to Bank of Montreal. After buying back €4bn of stock, the French bank said it would use the remainder of the proceeds to invest in technology and for acquisitions. Though BNP’s chief executive said this week that the bank would target small add-ons, a deal for Credit Suisse could prove tempting given the French group lacks a successful private banking arm and is weak in Asia. Credit Suisse may also be a takeover target for Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds that are flush with cash as a result of the booming energy prices amid the war in Ukraine. Investors from Saudi Arabia and Qatar already make up a fifth of the bank’s shareholder base. The turnround is still plan A for the bank. But shareholders and analysts are hoping to see more information as the results come out on Thursday — from details of the securitised products group sale, to clarity over how the bank will meet its ambitious cost-cutting targets. “They need to bring clarity,” said Kaufmann of Ethos. “When there is little transparency, rumours set in — and as we saw with the social media storm in October, that can be hugely damaging.” Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London and Sam Jones in Zurich Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","08.02.2023"

"Blackstone sells London waterfront complex to Singaporean group for £395mn","St Katharine Docks attracts nearly 6mn visitors each year","Blackstone has sold a £395mn waterfront office complex near the Tower of London to a Singaporean investor, who said turmoil in the UK had created a buying opportunity. St Katharine Docks, a complex of office buildings, retail space and a 185-berth marina to the east of the City of London, has been acquired by City Developments Ltd, the Singapore-based property group led by billionaire Kwek Leng Beng. The transaction comes at a difficult time for commercial property investors. Rising interest rates have knocked real estate valuations, and some property funds run by several major investors, including Blackstone, have limited withdrawals as investors pull out.  The UK has been particularly hard hit in the wake of last year’s “mini” Budget, which led to a sharp rise in interest rates and knocked investors’ confidence in Britain. “The current uncertainty in the UK has provided us with strategic opportunities to acquire prime assets and expand our portfolio,” said Sherman Kwek, City Developments’ chief executive. He said the company is confident in the UK’s long-term economic prospects. The pound hit a record low against the US dollar in the aftermath of the “mini” Budget in September. It has since recovered from those depths but remains 9 per cent lower against the dollar year on year, making UK assets better value for dollar-based international investors. Zachary Gauge, head of real estate research at UBS asset management, said that after a sharp fall in valuations at the end of last year, UK property now “appears attractively priced versus other global markets”. Blackstone said foreign investors were temporarily put off by the turmoil, but pent up demand and cheaper prices for sterling assets could reel in buyers this year. “When I am talking to investors out of Asia, my perspective is that they see an attractive entry point into sterling,” said James Seppala, Blackstone’s European head of real estate.  “My sense is that global capital might have been on pause during some portion of quarter four, but that hiatus could well lead to a rebound in activity over the course of 2023,” he added. The 23-acre complex near the foot of Tower Bridge, which takes its name from a 12th-century hospital built on the site, was the prize asset of Nick Leslau’s Max Property Group, which Blackstone acquired and took private in 2014. It spans 451,000 sq ft of office space let to tenants including WeWork and Northeastern University and attracts nearly 6mn visitors each year.  Blackstone estimated it paid about £300mn to buy St Katharine Docks as part of the broader deal for Max’s portfolio. It forms part of its fourth Blackstone Real Estate Partners Europe fund, which raised €6.7bn from institutional investors in 2013. Blackstone is one of the world’s largest real estate investors with a global portfolio worth $577bn and roughly €120bn in Europe, of which 13 per cent is made up of offices. The deal takes City Developments’ UK portfolio to more than £1bn. It owns two other office buildings in the capital.","09.03.2023"

For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog  Good evening. “Banking is a massive, complicated and delicate confidence trick. Normally it works fine. But as soon as people worry that it could fall apart, it often does, sometimes spectacularly.”  That was the view of Frankfurt bureau chief Martin Arnold after Credit Suisse was taken over by larger rival UBS at the weekend. The $3.25bn deal was finalised yesterday after Swiss regulators rushed to safeguard the country’s banking sector and prevent the crisis spreading across global markets. Ever since the current turmoil began with the collapse of lenders in the US (see Business section below), investors have worried about which other banks could be vulnerable. Credit Suisse was already in serious trouble after a series of scandals and management shake-ups and the shotgun wedding with UBS follows a $54bn failed lifeline from the Swiss central bank last week. Although the deal cements UBS’s position as the world’s largest wealth manager, with invested assets of $5tn, CS bondholders are in uproar and contemplating legal action after $17bn of the bank’s debt was wiped out. Bondholders with additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds — a form of debt introduced after the global financial crisis to make banks increase their capital levels —  will receive nothing, while shareholders will get some SFr3bn ($3.2bn). EU authorities have also expressed concern. CS staff will however still collect their bonuses.  As Arnold points out, Europe’s institutions, although in a stronger position than in the previous crisis, are not immune to the current turmoil. Lenders are also likely to become more cautious, reducing the flow of credit, increasing the risk of a recession and raising stress in already vulnerable areas such as commercial property — none of which is good for banks, he notes. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde today welcomed the Credit Suisse takeover and said the ECB was “ready to respond as necessary” to preserve price and financial stability. She stressed that the eurozone banking system was “resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions”. Although the bank failures in Europe and the US have different circumstances, one thing they have in common is the effect of sharp rises in global interest rates, with the current tumult potentially acting as a brake on central banks’ plans, starting with decisions from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday.  The other major development of the weekend was a co-ordinated plan from the Fed and five other central banks to improve access to US dollars “to ease strains in global funding markets”. The big question however remains: are banks on the edge of a 2008-style meltdown? FT deputy editor Patrick Jenkins, writing before the CS deal, said that even if the chances of another full-blown financial meltdown were low, our ability to deal with it might be less.  “Back in 2008, policymakers were able to slash interest rates, launch quantitative easing and flood the banks with rescue capital and liquidity,” he writes. “With government balance sheets today far more stretched, and interest rates needing to rise to combat inflation, the weaponry at their disposal is dangerously diminished.”  Need to know: UK and Europe economy The DUP, Northern Ireland’s biggest unionist party, will vote against Rishi Sunak’s deal on the province’s post-Brexit trading arrangements, dealing a blow to the prime minister and the chances of any imminent return of its power-sharing government.

"UniCredit’s board proposes 30% salary increase for chief Andrea Orcel","Italy’s second-largest lender has been one of the best-performing banks in Europe","UniCredit’s board has proposed raising chief executive Andrea Orcel’s salary by 30 per cent — from €2.5mn to €3.25mn a year — just weeks after the head of the Italian bank’s remuneration committee quit. Orcel is already one of the best-paid bankers in Europe, with a pay package of €7.5mn.  The new proposals announced on Wednesday envision him keeping that level of total pay if he hits the bank’s current targets, such as profits and return on equity. However, if he exceeds those targets his total pay could increase to €9.75mn.  Under EU rules, bonuses are capped related to annual fixed pay. UniCredit investors are broadly satisfied with Orcel’s performance as they begin to reap profits after years of restructuring under his predecessor, Jean Pierre Mustier.  Italy’s second-largest lender has been one of the best-performing banks in Europe since Orcel joined in April 2021, with its share price more than doubling. Annual profit rose 48 per cent to €5.2bn in 2022. It plans to distribute at least €5.25bn to shareholders this year through share buybacks as part of its goal to return €16bn by 2024. However, the pay increases proposed by the board have proven to be a highly sensitive issue at the bank.  Press reports about board-level conversations around Orcel’s salary requests were followed by an internal investigation into the source of the alleged leaks and ultimately led to Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia’s resignation last month.   As chair of the remuneration committee, Gadhia, the former chief executive of Virgin Money in the UK, was responsible for overseeing pay for senior executives.  The Financial Times reported this week she had been accused of the leaks. While the unsubstantiated allegations were withdrawn, she felt her position had become untenable and chose to step down “as a matter of principle” just three weeks ahead of Wednesday’s crucial proposals.  The chief executive’s proposed new package is the culmination of months of work for the remuneration committee. The panel of three board members is also charged with seeking the support of investors who have to vote on the proposals at an annual shareholder meeting. The next such event is due to take place on March 31.  Orcel’s pay package was only narrowly approved two years ago, when 42.7 per cent of shareholders voted against it, including BlackRock, the bank’s single-largest investor. In 2022 board and CEO agreed the issue would be revisited this year.  Some shareholders think Orcel should be paid more based on UniCredit’s strong performance in 2022 and the amount of money from UBS that he sacrificed following his departure from the Swiss bank. Others believe his current salary is sufficient especially in the context of the bank’s cost-cutting strategy.  Shareholders will now have one month to review the board’s proposals.  Last month, a Madrid court upheld Orcel’s multimillion-euro lawsuit against Spanish lender Santander over its aborted offer to make him CEO in 2019 and awarded him €43.5mn in compensation.","01.03.2023"
"Tech stock retreat leads Wall Street indices lower","Bank stocks steady and bond markets calm ","US equities slipped on Tuesday as rising bond yields and a calmer banking sector led mega cap technology stocks to give up some recent gains. The S&P 500 dipped 0.2 per cent, its first decline in three days, with tech giants such as Alphabet and Apple the biggest drags on the index. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.5 per cent. Large tech groups had been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the financial sector turmoil that started with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, but the sector has lost ground in recent days.   Jim Tierney, a growth-focused portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, said: “As the peak concerns around the banking sector are hopefully behind us, investors have started to broaden out their exposures and some of that has been at the expense of the largest tech companies . . . higher rates don’t help long-dated assets either.” Expectations for a more dovish Federal Reserve boosts stocks that promise long-term growth, and the largest tech groups were seen as less exposed to a potential downturn in bank lending. Bank stocks, in contrast, were relatively steady on Tuesday after notching up strong gains in the previous session. The KBW bank index added a further 0.3 per cent, having risen 2.5 per cent on Monday as regulators confirmed First Citizens Bank would purchase part of the collapsed SVB. First Republic, which has been among the hardest-hit in the fallout from SVB, fell 2.3 per cent after adding almost 12 per cent on Monday. “At the moment no news is good news. People are waiting for the dust to settle and to see if there is another banking stress,” said Nadège Dufossé, global head of multi-asset at Candriam. “I expect better news flow around inflation in coming months but for now we don’t know the impact on growth. We’re not out of the woods yet and will continue to see volatility.” Bond markets were calm as investors await fresh economic data and testimony from Fed later in the week. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury inched up 0.03 percentage points, to 3.56 per cent. Yields rise when prices fall. In Europe the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which includes the region’s biggest lenders, closed up 0.7 per cent. Commerzbank was among the biggest gainers, up 1.5 per cent. Deutsche Bank, however, fell 1.3 per cent.  The mood was reflected in broader share indices, with the region-wide benchmark Stoxx 600 flat and Germany’s Dax up 0.1 per cent. London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent. In currency markets, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six peer currencies, fell 0.4 per cent. The US currency has fallen 3 per cent in the past two weeks as investors’ expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates have receded. Investors and economists are now weighing the impact of the banking turmoil on growth and the likelihood and severity of a recession. According to analysts at UBS, the Fed’s downgrade of its 2023 growth forecast “suggests that either the banking stress is worse than investors currently know (the Fed gets bank data before the market) or the Fed is being conservative with its growth assumptions because the credit tightening impact is highly uncertain. For investors, the safest conclusion is that the risk of a recession has gone up.” Brent crude oil rose 0.7 per cent to $78.65 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, was up 0.5 per cent at $73.20 a barrel.","28.03.2023"
"Why China’s economic recovery is hanging in the balance","Stubborn property sector woes and lagging exports are jeopardising the country’s post-Covid rebound","Five months after China’s president Xi Jinping declared victory over the pandemic and relaxed stringent social controls, new data this week revealed that the country’s economy was far from returning to full health. While consumers are venturing out to spend, buyers are shunning property, one of the Chinese economy’s central growth drivers. Exports, another important engine, are flagging as high inflation abroad saps demand for Chinese goods. The government has already begun cutting interest rates, but analysts said fiscal rather than monetary stimulus would be needed to keep the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy on track. Here are the sectors imposing the greatest drag on the economy as well as those with a brighter outlook — and policymakers’ options for reviving growth. Property warning signals China’s property sector, which accounts for about 30 per cent of its economic output, is at the root of the economic malaise, according to analysts. “It’s not an exaggeration to say that property is at this point jeopardising the entire economic recovery,” said Chris Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics.  Consumers are suspicious of the sector. Many bought flats before buildings were constructed, only to find the properties were not delivered after a regulatory crackdown on leverage levels sent a number of developers into default.  The real estate market showed signs of stabilisation in the first quarter following a prolonged slump, but it has begun to slip again in recent weeks.  Sales, new project starts and floor space under construction all declined in May when measured as a share of seasonally adjusted pre-pandemic 2019 levels, Gavekal said. Completions slowed to 24 per cent year on year, from 42 per cent a month earlier, the research group added. The government is expected next week to cut the five-year lending rate that is used to benchmark mortgages, but analysts said more measures were needed to revive the sector, such as credit for cash-strapped developers and incentives including reductions in mortgage down payments. Exports slow dramatically Exports fell 7.5 per cent year on year in US dollar terms last month after rising 8.5 per cent in April as slower growth abroad hit demand, erasing what was a critical lifeline for the Chinese economy during the depths of the pandemic.  Analysts said the weakness in exports and property had also probably spilled over to industrial production, which decelerated in May. To cap it off, private fixed-asset investment also turned negative for the first time in more than a decade — with the exception of the start of the pandemic in 2020 — indicating that businesses were not investing.  “The manufacturing sector is dead on its feet at the moment and exports are poor,” said Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific head of research for ING. He added that there might be a structural shift, with US export restrictions on high-tech goods, notably semiconductor components and chipmaking equipment, affecting China’s trade with regional powerhouses such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Policymakers could choose to stimulate trade by tolerating a weaker renminbi. Lower interest rates would support that tactic — after the People’s Bank of China trimmed its main policy rate on Thursday, the currency fell as much as 0.3 per cent against the dollar to Rmb7.1807, a six-month low and putting it down about 4 per cent year to date.  Retail sales a beacon of hope Economists said the best hope for reviving growth across the economy was to fuel strong domestic demand, which would lead to a tighter job market, higher salaries and eventually a resurgence of confidence that could spill over into property and manufacturing. Retail sales expanded 12.7 per cent year on year as rattled consumers returned to stores after last year’s tough pandemic restrictions. But economists said on a seasonally adjusted basis, the gauge fell month on month, as a boost following the reopening began to fade. Catering was the strongest component, followed by automotive purchases, helped by policy incentives and discounts. Infrastructure loses momentum Infrastructure investment grew 8.8 per cent in May year on year, according to economists. But the gauge also lost ground from last year, when it was growing at a rate of 10 per cent, and growth in the segment was probably not strong enough to offset the property and exports weakness, analysts warned. “Infrastructure investment momentum is slowing,” said Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Société Générale, which she attributed to “very weak land sales from local governments”.  Economists said Beijing would need to resort to infrastructure to spur growth, suggesting policymakers could unleash local government special bonds (LGSBs) to spur investment.  Analysts at Nomura forecast that this could amount to an extra Rmb500bn ($70bn) of LGSBs, on top of the untapped portion of this year’s annual quota of Rmb1.86tn. The bank also noted that Beijing could consider issuing special central government bonds to raise additional funds. No ‘bazooka’ expected China’s economic bounceback is fragile — a challenge the government itself has acknowledged. “The foundation for the economic recovery is not yet solid,” the National Bureau of Statistics said this week.  More stimulus will be needed to return growth to pre-pandemic levels, and the central bank is expected to enact further rate cuts, which will be accompanied by tax breaks and other support for small businesses. Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS, said the government should prioritise putting a floor under the property sector’s woes. “Otherwise it’s very hard to stabilise the economy as a whole,” she warned. Wang added that she had reduced her full-year economic growth forecast to 5.2 per cent from 5.7 per cent. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Standard Chartered have also cut their projections, though all exceed the government’s official target of 5 per cent — its lowest in decades.  Despite the critical obstacles to recovery, there are few expectations for a “big bang”-style stimulus. In the past, China injected investment into the property sector to overcome downturns. But Beijing has long made clear its view that “houses are for living in, not for speculation”, damping expectations of a glut of activity in the sector to drive growth. “The ‘bazooka’ policies in the past have typically just ended up helping the property developer sector and I don’t think Xi wants to do that,” said ING’s Carnell.","16.06.2023"
"‘Getting close’: Federal Reserve chair seeds expectations for pause in interest rate rises","Jay Powell hints US central bank has done enough to tame inflation after 14-month campaign","Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell made no promise to pause a forceful campaign to rein in inflation after the US central bank lifted its benchmark interest rate above 5 per cent for the first time since 2007.  But for anyone listening to his nearly hour-long press conference on Wednesday, it was abundantly clear which way he was leaning.  “He couldn’t commit to a pause, but he all but did,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.   The trajectory of US monetary policy has entered a new phase after 10 successive interest rate rises since March 2022. Raging inflation has begun to subside and economic growth is slowing. Turmoil in the financial sector, with failures of regional banks such as First Republic this week, have emboldened arguments for a pause in rate increases.  The Federal Open Market Committee nodded to the new landscape in a statement following its decision to raise the federal funds rate by a quarter-point to a new target range of 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent.  The committee ditched guidance it provided after its last meeting in March, when it said it “anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate” to bring inflation under control. Rather, on Wednesday it said that “in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate”, officials would take into account factors including incoming data and the cumulative impact of its recent string of rate increases. The change, which Powell later described as “meaningful”, implied that while the Fed was soon likely to call time on further rate rises, it was not ruling them out.  Powell stuck to that message at the start of his press conference, saying in his opening remarks that the central bank is “prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted”. But as the question-and-answer session progressed, Powell’s comments more directly hinted that with interest rates now above 5 per cent and a credit crunch among stressed regional banks likely to further cool the economy, the Fed may have finally reached a point where it has done enough to bend inflation down towards its longstanding 2 per cent target.  “There is a sense that we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning,” he told reporters. “If you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various channels, we feel like we’re getting close or maybe even there.” Tiffany Wilding, chief US economist at Pimco, said pausing rate rises at the Fed’s next meeting in June would be the right call, given her concern that a pullback in bank credit could act as a “major drag” on the economy.  According to Powell, the Fed’s latest report tracking banks’ lending practices — the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, due to be publicly released Monday — will show midsized banks further tightening lending standards. “Powell and others have always said that monetary policy is an exercise in risk management, and I think what has become clear is that the downside risks to the outlook have grown, potentially substantially, and given that shifting balance of risk, it’s appropriate to pause,” Wilding said.  Powell acknowledged that in light of bank stress, the Fed need not raise interest rates “quite as high” as they would have in a more stable situation. But he made clear that the magnitude of the impact was uncertain and complicated the central bank’s assessment of when the policy rate has reached a so-called “sufficiently restrictive stance” — meaning one in which demand is damped enough to push inflation down to target. Zandi at Moody’s Analytics went so far as to say it was a “mistake” for the Fed to have raised rates on Wednesday, citing not only the fact that the labour market is showing clear signs of weakening and inflation is easing, but that the bank stress is “serious” and not yet resolved.   “The system is still very fragile and unsettled, and they need to pay attention to this,” he said. For some economists, the bigger error from Powell was in hinting too strongly that a pause is forthcoming, leaving the Fed exposed to having to abruptly change course if economic data suggests the inflation problem persists.  Jonathan Pingle, the chief US economist at UBS who used to work at the Fed, has warned that the wage data in Friday’s monthly jobs report is likely to be strong, as is core inflation measured by the consumer price index to be released next week. These could create what he called a “tough communications challenge” as the Fed would need to explain why it was “looking through that”.  Powell “may have wanted to increase the optionality towards a pause, but in the way he answered questions he pushed too far,” said Peter Hooper, vice-chair of research at Deutsche Bank, who worked for the Fed for almost 30 years. “I think he may regret [that].”","04.05.2023"
"Rising sales and business activity point to UK economic resilience ","Figures published on Friday show economy is faring remarkably well considering headwinds","The UK economy may be more resilient than thought in the face of rising inflation, higher borrowing costs and banking turmoil, according to data released on Friday showing that retail sales and consumer sentiment were up and business activity had expanded.  The volume of retail sales, or the amount of goods sold in UK shops, increased 1.2 per cent in February, after a 0.9 per cent jump the previous month according to the Office for National Statistics. Analysts had predicted a smaller rise of 0.5 per cent. It was the first time since August 2022 that sales rose to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the closely watched monitor of private sector health, the S&P Global’s flash UK composite purchasing managers’ index, eased to 52.2 in March from 53.1 in the previous month. Despite the drop, it was still above the 50 mark, signalling that a majority of businesses had reported an expansion.   The data suggest some economic resilience in the face of the multiple headwinds. On Wednesday official figures showed that UK inflation unexpectedly rose to 10.4 per cent in February, up from 10.1 per cent the previous month and not far below its October peak of 11.1 per cent.   The following day, the Bank of England raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 per cent, marking the central bank’s 11th consecutive increase since December 2021. Global banking turmoil, with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the hasty merger of Credit Suisse and UBS, which is likely to make banks more cautious about lending, added to the challenges. Yet the figures published on Friday are “consistent with the economy faring remarkably well” in the face of those challenges, said Gabriella Dickens, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  Chris Williamson, chief economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence estimated that the PMIs were consistent with a 0.2 per cent expansion of the UK economy in the first quarter — an improvement from the stagnation of the previous three quarters.  Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said in a BBC interview on Friday that he expected Britain would now avoid recession this year. “The prospects for the economy in terms of growth are better, considerably better,” he said.  Bailey also urged businesses to assume lower inflation when setting prices.  “But what I would say, please, is that when we are setting prices in the economy and people are looking forwards, we do expect inflation to come down sharply this year. And I would just say, please bear that in mind,” he said. His comments came as business costs grew at their slowest pace since March 2021, according to the PMI report.  Survey respondents were the most optimistic about their business prospects since March 2022, which Williamson said showed “sentiment has been little affected so far by the banking sector woes”. Separate data by the research company GfK showed that UK consumer confidence ticked up 2 points from the previous month to a one-year high of minus 36 in March.  However, retail sales were still down 0.3 per cent in the three months to February compared with the previous three months, following a sharp contraction in December.   “The broader picture remains more subdued, with retail sales showing little real growth, particularly over the last 18 months with price rises hitting consumer spending power,” cautioned ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan. Moreover, sales were boosted by discount department stores and food shops as cost of living pressures led consumers to cut back on takeaways or eating out, according to the ONS.   “The coming months may still be a struggle for retailers,” warned Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics. “Although the worst of the falls in real household incomes are in the past, the full drag on activity from higher interest rates has yet to be felt.” ","24.03.2023"
"Eurozone businesses report strong surge in activity","Closely watched PMI reading hits highest level in almost a year","Eurozone business activity expanded faster than expected in March, driven by growth in the dominant services sector, indicating that an economic rebound from last year’s energy crisis remains on track.  A survey of purchasing managers published by S&P Global on Friday pointed to an easing of supply constraints, lower input price pressures and an acceleration of jobs growth, although companies also expressed concern about banking stress and higher borrowing costs. The flash eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index, a measure of activity in manufacturing and services, rose for the fifth consecutive month to a 10-month high of 54.1 in March, up from 52 in the previous month and higher than the reading of 51.9 expected by economists.   The result was based on responses collected between March 10 and March 22, with the impact on confidence of the banking turmoil that resulted in the rescue takeover of Credit Suisse by rival UBS only partially accounted for. About a third of the results were collected this week.  The reading was also above the 50 mark for the third month in a row, meaning a majority of businesses in the 20-country bloc reported an increase in their activity from the previous month.  “Growth has been buoyed since the lows of late last year as recession fears and energy market worries fade,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.  However, he added that “stubborn inflationary pressures” indicated “more work may be needed in terms of bringing inflation down to target”. The resilient performance of the eurozone economy has boosted demand and kept price pressures elevated, contributing to the European Central Bank’s decision to raise interest rates by half a percentage point last week. The survey found a “steep rise” in input costs at services companies due to rising wages, while industrial input prices fell for the first time since July 2020, reflecting improved supply chains and lower demand.  Average selling prices “continued to rise sharply”, as companies passed on more of their higher costs to customers — although the rate slowed to its lowest since May 2021.  “Continued fast price increases, a still-resilient labour market and signs the economy is weathering interest rate hikes well so far, will bolster ECB hawks’ calls for the bank to continue on its steep tightening path, despite wobbles in the banking sector,” said Melanie Debono, an economist at research group Pantheon Macroeconomics. The PMI results highlighted a contrast between the improved outlook of services companies and a sharper-than-expected downturn in manufacturing. The PMI score for the services sector hit a 10-month high, while the reading for manufacturing fell to a four-month low.  Employment growth rose to a nine-month high, driven by a pick-up in hiring at services companies. Business confidence about the year ahead dipped from February’s 12-month high, which S&P Global said “could be in part traced to concerns over uncertainty caused by recent banking sector stress and the potential impact of further interest rate hikes”. Franziska Palmas, an economist at research group Capital Economics, said she still expected a eurozone recession later this year as higher interest rates hit demand, but added that a rebound in new orders recorded by the PMI survey “suggests it may take a bit longer than we anticipated for that weakening to occur”. Growth picked up in financial services and the real estate sector, as well as in consumer services, such as travel and tourism. There was also higher activity in the industrial services, IT and healthcare sectors.   Stronger growth in the automotive sector, helped by easing supply constraints, was a rare bright spot amid broad stagnation in the manufacturing sector, where new orders have fallen for 11 consecutive months.","24.03.2023"

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter The dealmaking family behind First CitizensThe Saudi National Bank chair resignsNorthvolt powers Europe’s battery efforts How SVB’s acquirer bought failed banks and built a dynasty When the US banking sector was facing ruin in 2008, one family of savvy dealmakers was quietly building an empire from the rubble.  But their best find was yet to come. On Monday, the billionaire North Carolina family dynasty behind First Citizens Bank found its signature deal to add to a collection of distressed banks it has bought: Silicon Valley Bank. SVB was the latest acquisition by the small town lender founded in North Carolina in 1898 as the Bank of Smithfield, which was renamed First Citizens and has scooped more than a dozen failed lenders over the past two decades, while striking transformative deals. The Raleigh-based bank’s purchase of SVB will more than double its assets to $219bn, making it the 16th-largest lender in the US and a major player in the world of highflying tech start-ups that once turned to SVB for financing. First Citizens’ work with start-ups in North Carolina’s Research Triangle, which is popular with biotechs, has been limited in comparison. But Frank Holding Jr., the bank’s chief executive and third-generation scion of the family business, has committed to the challenge. That will be no easy feat: First Citizens must not only stem a further exodus of SVB depositors but also win over Silicon Valley’s clubby ranks of tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. One area First Citizens does have experience in, however, is absorbing distressed rivals.  “[Holding] is not afraid to do any deal,” Phil Timyan, a private investor who has owned shares in First Citizens for nearly two decades, told DD’s Antoine Gara and the Financial Times’s Stephen Gandel. Holding, together with his sister and vice-chair Hope Bryant and his brother-in-law and president Peter Bristow, have taken the deposits of ailing lenders including California’s Temecula Valley Bank, Washington state’s Venture Bank, Florida’s Sun American Bank and Colorado’s United Western Bank off the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s hands. They’re now poised to receive a paper windfall of more than $500mn: the Holdings control First Citizens and its family members now own about $2bn in stock, according to FT calculations, after its shares soared by more than 50 per cent on Monday following the SVB deal.  In addition to frequenting FDIC auctions, the Holding clan is also known to have pursued hostile attempts to buy publicly listed lenders.  They also acquired CIT Group in 2022, taking advantage of “sticky” and cheap deposits from branches in hundreds of small towns across the south-east to lower the business lender’s financing costs and increase profits. DD is keen to see what catches their eye next given their newfound heft. Pour one out for the Saudi National Bank chair Ammar Alkhudairy has had an impressive career, from chairing Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs’ Saudi Arabia businesses to — until this week — running the board of the Saudi National Bank.  But what his CV fails to reflect is his extraordinary gift for putting his foot in his mouth. So when the man who described the SNB’s $1.5bn investment in Credit Suisse as “just another cheque” stepped down from the Saudi lender this week, DD wasn’t too surprised.  Alkhudairy’s resignation, for which he cited “personal reasons”, comes after he took to Bloomberg TV earlier this month to clarify that the SNB, CS’s largest shareholder, would “absolutely not” put any more money into the ailing Swiss bank. Investors who subsequently panicked at these comments took his words slightly out of context. He also stated that buying more shares would have pushed SNB’s stake above the 10 per cent and caused a “regulatory issue”. But by the time he clarified that he was happy with CS’s turnround plan and didn’t think the lender would need extra money, it was too late. CS’s share price had gone into a tailspin. Ammar Alkhudairy © Faisal Al Nasser/Bloomberg DD readers know what happened next: frantic negotiations culminating in a shotgun merger with its fierce rival UBS. The timing of Alkhudairy’s departure wasn’t lost on his fellow bankers, either. “For the biggest investor to say I’m not putting another dime in was a huge vote of non-confidence. I could argue that had he not said anything we might have been in a very different situation,” said a person close to CS’s top management. Said one Saudi Arabia-based banker: “The issue of the chairman’s statement did not go unnoticed among the senior decision makers.” UBS’s historic rescue of CS resulted in about $1bn of losses for SNB, but one person with knowledge of the details said the stake in the Swiss bank accounted for less than 2 per cent of its investment portfolio and would have a negligible impact on profitability. And much of the blame rests with decades of the Swiss bank’s own poor decision making, as well as holes in Switzerland’s regulatory system, the FT’s Patrick Jenkins writes. If anything, Alkhudairy’s commentary has come to symbolise Saudi Arabia’s growing financial firepower. “This is the first time a Saudi bank chair has moved global markets,” said one local analyst. Executives at the two banks rolling up their sleeves for a painful integration will at least breathe sighs of relief that their shares may no longer be at the mercy of Alkhudairy’s commentary. Funding Europe’s battery ambitions Swedish start-up Northvolt wants to become Europe’s biggest battery manufacturer. That goal will come at a hefty price.The company is negotiating with a number of banks to secure more than $5bn of financing, DD’s Ivan Levingston and the FT’s Richard Milne have revealed. An agreement could be reached later this year.Northvolt has already raised a total of $8bn in equity and debt financing since its founding in 2017, powering a rapid rise that has seen it become the main European challenger to the big Asian producers that dominate the industry such as China’s CATL.Much of that cash has already gone to work, as Northvolt produced its first battery from its European factory south of the Arctic Circle in Sweden at the end of 2021. It’s about to begin building a second “gigafactory” jointly with Volvo Cars, but the real question is where it will build its third plant.After previously announcing it would build its next gigafactory in Germany, in recent months the company has said it is considering whether to postpone that and build in the US instead, attracted by subsidies provided by the country’s Inflation Reduction Act.Even beyond its debt plans, Northvolt is looking down the road for future sources of capital. The company is also talking to banks about a stock market listing as soon as next year at a valuation of about $20bn.

"Global investment banks’ profits drop in China","Goldman Sachs unit reports losses and Morgan Stanley’s profits fall as tensions rise between west and Beijing","Profits at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and a clutch of other western banks in China fell sharply last year, as Covid-19 lockdowns and geopolitical tensions thwarted hopes that their operations in the country might finally start to be lucrative. Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC reported losses in their China-based units in 2022 and Morgan Stanley’s profits fell, figures published by the lenders and seen by the Financial Times show. Among a group of seven Wall Street and European groups with investment banking units in mainland China, JPMorgan and UBS were the only banks whose profits rose, though HSBC’s unit lost less money than in previous years.  The western banks have spent years investing in small and often lossmaking operations in China in the hope that a foothold in the world’s second-largest economy would eventually prove profitable. But as relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorate, the figures show how difficult that bet has become. “These guys established these [mainland units] when China was all about growth . . . and you didn’t have the geopolitics in the background”, said a veteran Hong Kong financier. “The fact is a lot of that has changed.”  The lacklustre performance marks a reversal from 2021, a record year for investment banks globally, when six of the seven made a profit in their mainland operations after Beijing allowed them to start taking full ownership of the units for the first time following a trade deal with the US. The lenders cited US-China tensions, Covid-19 restrictions, China’s property crisis, reduced onshore stock trading, restructuring costs and fierce competition for the losses and meagre returns, corporate filings show. Progress has stalled just as global banks assess how hard their businesses in China might be hit by US sanctions and greater scrutiny from Washington. The banks have also received requests from Chinese regulators to rein in executive pay and defer bonuses, in line with President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” drive. Some have started holding back on work that might have otherwise proven lucrative in order to avoid running up against US sanctions.  “AI is the next big thing and five years ago, we would’ve spent a lot of time covering Chinese AI companies,” said a top executive at a western investment bank in Hong Kong. “But now, no. They might end up on an entity list in the US.” The seven banks collectively accounted for just 0.1 per cent of the Rmb395bn ($56bn) revenue made by a total of 140 investment banks in China last year. The mainland units do not represent all of the money the banks are making in China because profits from some business lines, including advising Chinese companies on US or Hong Kong listings, are often booked elsewhere. “As long as the major US banks can build up their branding among high net worth individuals in China, they can potentially grow their business substantially in China’s $10tn asset management sector,” said Victor Shih, professor of Chinese political economy at the University of California San Diego. “It will be tricky for them to navigate the regulatory landscape in both the US and China.” JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon is due to visit China this month for the first time since he was forced to apologise in 2021 for saying the bank would outlast the Chinese Communist party. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai on May 30 for a series of conferences and then travel to Hong Kong for meetings. The global banks did not win a significant amount of business in the booming market for initial public offerings on mainland exchanges in the first half of last year. Listings there jumped even as New York, London and Hong Kong exchanges struggled with a drop in IPOs. Executives at two of the banks said their institutions were hesitant about participating because underwriting standards were sometimes lower than in other markets.  On the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s fast-growing Star board, which has raised Rmb17.9bn from 11 IPOs in the first quarter of this year, banks are required to invest their own money in the public offerings on which they advise. New York listings of Chinese companies, once a lucrative source of fees that western banks held up as justification for their lossmaking mainland presence, have dwindled after a regulatory crackdown from Beijing and more stringent audit checks from US regulators.  Global banks still dominate the market for Hong Kong listings, but Chinese rivals are beginning to challenge that position. Chinese banks are increasingly “trying to squeeze in” by telling clients they should hire a mainland bank as well as an international one for a Hong Kong IPO, a senior executive in the mainland business at one of the global banks said. The China units are tiny in the context of global banks’ overall operations. JPMorgan’s China Securities unit made a $38mn profit, compared with the bank’s overall $38bn profit last year. Goldman’s net loss in China of $58mn came in the context of an $11.3bn profit globally. HSBC said it was “fully committed” to its mainland securities unit, which was “showing good momentum”. The other banks declined to comment. More foreign banks are in the early stages of setting up mainland operations. Citi applied to establish a fully owned securities unit in 2021 but has not received approval for it. Standard Chartered was awarded a licence to set up a fully controlled securities unit in January. Despite the headwinds, the western lenders are unlikely to abandon their mainland units. “They’ve planted the seed,” said one senior banker. “It’s expensive to get licences and hire people. I don’t see them exiting the market at all.”","22.05.2023"
"Korea Inc’s big battery bet on Indonesia at risk from US restrictions","Involvement with Chinese partners on nickel and other battery-related ventures could fall foul of IRA legislation","South Korean companies are relying on the US showing greater flexibility over China’s role in electric vehicle supply chains, as they invest heavily — often with Chinese partners — in battery materials production in Indonesia. A $441mn investment last month by Korean metals giant Posco in a nickel smelting plant on the Indonesian island of Halmahera has taken South Korea’s hard-cash dealmaking in the south-east Asian country to more than $3bn since the start of 2022, the bulk of it being battery-related. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of nickel, a crucial ingredient that Korea’s leading EV battery companies need for the multibillion-dollar factories they are building in the US.  Yet the majority of Indonesia’s nickel production and processing is controlled by Chinese companies, complicating Korean efforts to construct a supply chain that fulfils US demands for batteries free of Chinese ownership of key components.  “South Korea was planning to use Indonesia as a major global hub for electric vehicle production,” said Kyunghoon Kim, an associate research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.  “But without concessions from the US, it will be difficult,” he added. At best, Indonesia could end up “as a regional production hub”. The US Inflation Reduction Act offers billions of dollars in tax credits to battery companies only if a certain percentage of the value of critical minerals contained in their products is processed or extracted in the US or by partners with free trade agreements.  Indonesia lacks a free trade agreement with the US, and Washington is yet to spell out how it will define the “foreign entities of concern” — a reference to China — that it wants to be phased out of the US battery supply chain by the beginning of 2025. Korean investment has intensified under Indonesian president Joko Widodo, who implemented an export ban on raw nickel ore in 2020. The move spurred international companies to invest in nickel processing within the country’s borders, with many of those deals involving partners from mainland China.   South Korea’s LG Energy Solution, the world’s leading non-Chinese producer of EV batteries, announced a partnership in April last year with Posco, two Indonesian state-owned companies and Chinese miner Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, with a series of investments that would eventually total $9bn. Then, in November, a partnership was announced between fellow Korean battery maker SK On with Korean cathode producer EcoPro and Chinese battery component producer Green Eco-Manufacture to produce an intermediate nickel product called mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Posco, whose chemicals subsidiary has a $33bn supply agreement with Korea’s other battery major, Samsung SDI, signed a preliminary agreement in February with Chinese mining firm Ningbo Liqin to produce nickel and MHP on Sulawesi. The problem, said Tim Bush, a Seoul-based battery analyst at UBS, is the Inflation Reduction Act has given companies until the beginning of 2025 — just over 18 months away — to complete the construction of a new, “IRA-compliant” supply chain, despite them having no clear sense of what level of Chinese involvement will be permitted. “It is extremely difficult for the Korean companies to pull the trigger on the multibillion-dollar investments that will be required to diversify their supply chain when they still haven’t been informed of the rules of the road,” said Bush. In May, the chief financial officer of LG Chem, the parent of LG Energy Solution, told investors its working assumption was that the US government would apply the same definition of “foreign entities of concern” that it uses for legislation concerning the semiconductor industry.  That would mean that joint ventures with a Chinese equity stake of over 25 per cent would not qualify for the credits, in effect excluding most of Indonesia’s nickel supplies from the alternative supply chains the US is hoping to build. “The Korean companies have gone all-in on Indonesia and now they are in a quandary,” said Ross Gregory, Seoul-based executive director of EV consultancy New Electric Partners. Gregory also noted environmental concerns surrounding carbon-intensive mining practices in Indonesia. “The risk is that the nickel they get will be both non-IRA compliant and not clean enough. They urgently need to diversify.” However, a Europe-based nickel trader observed that Indonesian nickel is discounted about 30 per cent compared to London Metal Exchange prices for alternative products such as Australian briquettes.  “They’re sitting there saying we can’t survive [without it],” they said. “I can carry on buying expensive nickel or I can put myself in the game to buy the cheapest nickel in the world.” Posco, which took a 30 per cent stake in Australia’s Ravensthorpe Nickel in 2021, told the Financial Times that “we are diversifying nickel sourcing to Australia and New Caledonia to reduce our dependence on Indonesia, although we are not particularly concerned about our exposure to Indonesia”. Earlier this year, the US treasury issued guidelines that will make it easier for Korean companies to produce more components domestically. It means that nickel products sourced in Indonesia but processed in Korea could still be designated as IRA-compliant. Jakarta is also lobbying Washington for Indonesia to receive a tailored trade deal on critical minerals similar to one agreed with Japan in March.  A Korean battery executive who did not wish to be named acknowledged that “we have no option but to rely on Chinese technology and knowhow for nickel processing at low cost”, but added this meant that Washington was likely to adopt a definition of “foreign entities of concern” tailored to the specific needs of the battery industry. “If they say any joint venture in which China holds even a 1 per cent stake is an entity of concern, the US could be strangling itself, as no company would be able actually to meet the Inflation Reduction Act’s conditions,” he warned.

"Swedish real estate sector rattled as refinancing worries surface","Analysts highlight country’s exposure to rising interest rates","Hedge funds have cranked up their bets against Sweden’s real estate sector as investors predict higher interest rates will weigh on domestic property prices and expose its vulnerability to tighter bank lending. Traders’ worries have intensified after S&P on Monday flagged its concerns over the outlook for SBB, one of the market’s biggest players, which needs to refinance short-term debt that matures in the coming year.  The credit rating agency cut the Swedish landlord’s rating to junk territory and drew attention to its high leverage and tightening market liquidity. But investors fear S&P’s doubts are a harbinger for an industry grappling with the impact of rising interest rates and cooling real estate prices.  “The closer we look at Sweden the worse things seem to appear,” said James McMorrow, Europe commercial property economist at Capital Economics.  For a decade global commercial real estate companies took advantage of rising property values and low interest rates to load up on debt. But many will need to refinance their borrowings just as interest rates touch their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts and traders have set their sights on the Scandinavian country because of the industry’s reliance on short-term debt. Hedge funds’ short positions in the Swedish real estate sector have soared this year, reaching their highest level in over a decade, according to data provider Breakout Point. A sell-off in SBB spread to domestic residential and commercial property competitors, including Fabege, Fastighets and Corem, which have also increasingly been targeted by short sellers this year. On Tuesday, five of the 10 worst-performing stocks in Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 index were Swedish real estate companies.  Charles Boissier, head of European real estate at UBS research, pointed out that “as a sector [real estate] has been leveraging up quite aggressively in the last 10-15 years. That is not just Sweden, but Germany and other markets.” Property yields — which move inversely to prices — are also forecast to push higher as rates and the cost of debt rise. Based on the current cost of debt available in the market, yields on “prime” Stockholm offices could yet rise this year to 4.7 per cent from 3.5 per cent, said Mark Unsworth, head of real estate economics at Oxford Economics, implying a 25 per cent drop in prices.   Swedish property groups also rely more on bank funding. Several US regional bank stocks have slumped since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, while April’s euro area bank lending survey showed the pace at which lenders were tightening their credit standards was at its highest level since the continent’s sovereign debt crisis in 2011.  Bloomberg data suggests that about $40bn of Swedish property groups’ combined bond debt will mature over the next five years, with $10bn due in 2023. About 70 per cent of Swedish property bond issuance is also floating rate, compared with just 2 per cent in the eurozone.  “These together make Swedish property and Swedish property companies particularly vulnerable to higher interest rates,” Capital Economics’ McMorrow said, even though the outlook for Sweden’s economy “does not look drastically worse than its neighbours in Scandinavia or the eurozone”. Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe, said investors were paying close attention to the trouble brewing in Sweden’s real estate industry, in part because the country’s sensitivity to higher interest rates means the effects of tighter monetary policy are likely to show up earlier than elsewhere. The Riksbank has raised rates from zero per cent to 3.5 per cent over the past year. “Sweden is potentially a canary in the coal mine for [other European economies] and that’s why markets are taking heed,” he said. However, UBS’s Boissier played down the risk. Across Europe’s big listed real estate companies as a whole, just 16 per cent of the debt matures before the end of next year, making a broad “liquidity crunch” unlikely, the bank found.  In Sweden investors’ fears have coalesced around SBB, which was forced to cancel its dividend and a rights issue after S&P cut its debt rating. Its shares are down 40 per cent this week, to its lowest level in five years, and 90 per cent since the start of last year. In February 2022, Fraser Perring’s Viceroy Research announced it was shorting the stock, describing SBB as a “debt-fuelled roll-up of rent-controlled assets”. SBB said the short report contained “numerous and material errors, misleading assumptions and [made] unsubstantiated claims”. Hedge funds have upped their bets against the company’s shares from 18.3 per cent of the outstanding shares at the start of the year to 24.1 per cent, according to data group S&P Global Market Intelligence. Among funds betting against the company are Marshall Wace, Gladstone Capital and Perbak Capital, according to Breakout Point.   But SBB’s domestic rivals are expected to come under pressure too. At roughly 45 per cent, Swedish listed real estate companies’ average loan-to-value ratio is the third highest in Europe after Norway and Italy, said Oxford Economics’ Unsworth. “[But] there will be a distribution around that average so perhaps what we are seeing is those stocks with the highest leverage starting to face refinancing challenges.”","11.05.2023"
"Investors bet Fed has finished raising interest rates","Turmoil in banking sector aids central bank’s fight against inflation by tightening financial conditions","Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate rise this week will be the last in its campaign to curb inflation, with the failure of two regional US banks and a rescue deal for Credit Suisse aiding the central bank’s mission to tighten financial conditions and turn the screws on borrowers. Two weeks ago, futures markets reflected expectations that the US central bank’s key rate would rise as high as 5.7 per cent by the summer.  But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its peer Signature — and the shotgun wedding of Credit Suisse and UBS after a tense weekend of negotiations — have forced a drastic repricing of how much further the Fed will need to act to pursue its policy goals.  The Fed has jacked up interest rates in the world’s largest economy from near zero at the start of last year to a range of 4.75 to 5 per cent after its latest policy announcement on Wednesday — the highest rate since 2007. But recent ructions in the banking industry have sparked fears about tougher lending conditions, with financial institutions expected to increasingly pull back credit lines to protect their own balance sheets.  Markets are not excluding the possibility of one more quarter-point rise in May, but a hold followed by a series of cuts later in the year is now seen as the most likely scenario. The angst in the banking sector has already damped banks’ willingness to lend to businesses and individuals, the same effect produced by higher interest rates. The ripples are likely to continue. US corporate debt and equity issuance has slowed in the past two weeks, and a market measure that quantifies bank funding stress — the FRA-OIS spread — on Wednesday rose to its highest level in more than three months.  Investor fears of a dramatic slowdown in mortgage lending, particularly in commercial real estate, which is primarily driven by regional banks, have proliferated. “Banks are under pressure on three different fronts: funding costs, the declining value of assets, and regulatory scrutiny. If you combine these three things, you do begin to wonder about banks’ willingness to lend over the coming quarters,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. “The Fed was already in the process of tightening credit conditions. Now suddenly we have a magnifying effect, which could potentially mean faster tightening of financial conditions, which in turn raises the risk of a sudden stop in the economy.”  Fed chair Jay Powell on Wednesday admitted that the events of the last fortnight were “likely to result in some tightening of credit conditions”. In turn, that market-induced tightening will work “in the same direction as rate tightening”, he said, implying that the central bank may not need to raise borrowing costs as aggressively as previously anticipated because investors will do the job instead. “You can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike, or perhaps more than that,” said Powell. Also released on Wednesday, the Fed’s “dot plot” showed that officials are still expecting at least another interest rate increase this year. “The lack of bank lending that we are going to see over the intermediate term will tighten financial conditions, which the Fed wants to do,” said John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “The banks will act at the behest of what the Fed is trying to accomplish.” With conditions becoming tougher for borrowers the Fed may be under less pressure to continue its own battle against inflation — taking a foot off the pedal that has compressed financial markets for the better part of 12 months. “The price of credit is moving higher,” said Steve Booth, head of investment grade corporates at T Rowe Price. “Financial conditions will tighten on the back of this, and that introduces broader economic risk. And then obviously, what that means for policy is the next obvious question.”","23.03.2023"
"Financial turmoil complicates central banks’ focus on inflation","Some former monetary policymakers fear narrow focus on damping price pressures could exacerbate panic","Former central bankers are divided on whether the Federal Reserve and Bank of England should press on with interest rate rises or pause to assess how far banking turmoil will curb lending and choke demand. The European Central Bank last week went ahead with a planned half a percentage point rise, insisting there was “no trade-off” between fighting inflation and ensuring financial stability.  The Fed will make its decision later on Wednesday, with the BoE move set for midday UK time on Thursday. Analysts expect quarter-point increases from both, despite the collapse of US lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, and the rescue-takeover of Credit Suisse by Swiss rival UBS.   Claudia Sahm, a consultant and former Fed economist, said the bank failures showed rates had risen enough. “A group of us already thought the Fed was going too hard, too fast . . . that the Fed is going to break something,” she said, referring to a series of bumper three-quarter point rate rises by the US central bank last year. “Well, they did.”  Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor at London Business School and former director-general of research at the ECB, said banking scares should serve “as a wake-up call” to the impact higher borrowing costs had already had. Market tensions would inevitably “have an effect on financial conditions on top of what was happening already”, she said, arguing that the ECB and BoE should halt rate increases and the Fed slow its pace. Others said officials should carry on raising rates.  “This is not the ECB in 2008,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, referring to the now-infamous ECB decision to raise interest rates ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn of that year.  Posen, a BoE rate-setter from 2009 to 2012, said both the Fed and BoE should raise rates or risk entrenching “the inflationary dynamics”.  While the collapse of US banks would “no doubt” make banks warier of lending, the effect would be modest and was in any case part of the Fed’s efforts to cool the economy. “If it takes that form, so be it,” he said. Charles Goodhart, a former member of the BoE Monetary Policy Committee who was among the first to warn of the recent surge in inflation, said the choice for the BoE should be clear. “In the UK, it would be quite wrong to pause,” he said, arguing this would lead people to suspect hidden problems in banks. It would also trigger concerns the BoE was “giving more weight to financial stability than to inflation”. Rate-setters could abandon rate rises if it becomes clear that banks are sharply reining in lending in response to the turmoil. ECB president Christine Lagarde said earlier this week that a recent drop in eurozone banks’ willingness to provide credit “might be accentuated” by market tensions and that the central bank would need to factor that into its next decisions. In the US, Jason Furman, former adviser to ex-US president Barack Obama, argued that “the Fed should change its view . . . only to reflect a tightening of financial conditions”.  Francesco Papadia, a former head of market operations at the ECB, warned that central banks would not necessarily be able to maintain a clear separation between price stability and financial stability if banking problems escalated into a broader, systemic crisis.  It was “entirely conceivable” that a situation could arise in which liquidity operations were not enough to stabilise markets, he said, adding that “if things deteriorate more than currently expected, the dilemma between financial and price stability could emerge”. Posen said problems in the US so far were confined to a set of midsized banks that “exploited a regulatory loophole”, with no sign of systemic problems.  But he added: “I hope I’m right.”","22.03.2023"
"The challenges for Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda — in charts","New central bank head inherits an asset-laden balance sheet and the world’s last negative interest rates","Since becoming the Bank of Japan’s governor this month, Kazuo Ueda has carefully signalled policy continuity. Few investors are taking his words at face value. With the first change in BoJ governorship in a decade, a break in bank tradition with an academic at the helm and inflation at a multi-decade high, the stage is set for change. Ueda’s first policy board meeting, which kicked off on Thursday, will offer crucial clues as to whether the 71-year-old economist is really committed to the status quo or laying the groundwork to unravel Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy regime.  Any change in policy will have huge implications for capital markets accustomed to the bank’s massive bond purchases and interventions to try to control interest rates. The immediate concern for investors is whether the BoJ will further revise or abandon yield curve control, a policy it pioneered in 2016 to cap rates on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds at about zero per cent. Most economists expect Ueda to hold off on changing the YCC framework until the summer, although he may surprise investors by scrapping it immediately while speculative pressure on Japanese bonds remains low.  A bigger question that will govern Ueda’s five-year term is whether the central bank is on the cusp of finally achieving its 2 per cent inflation target as prices and wages rise. If there is enough certainty to reach the target, Ueda has already signalled he would aim to unwind extreme policy tools deployed over the past decade that have expanded the BoJ’s balance sheet to 120 per cent of Japan’s gross domestic product. “At the moment trend inflation is below 2 per cent, so we will continue monetary easing,” Ueda told parliament this week. “If it is projected to reach 2 per cent, then we will head towards normalisation. We will scrutinise even more closely so that we will not make a wrong judgment on the inflation outlook.” Analysts warn that any exit strategy would require the BoJ and the government to address a daunting list of issues before Ueda can actually implement it without destabilising global financial markets.  “Dealing with the aftermath of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing will be costly, and it will be an extremely difficult balancing act,” said Ayako Fujita, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Securities.   If Ueda revises or ditches YCC in the coming months, the BoJ is then expected to review negative interest rates, which Japan is alone in maintaining. But removing the deposit rate of minus 0.1 per cent is also expected to be a slow process given the potential impact on the stock of floating-rate household mortgage debt that has mounted since the policy was introduced in 2016. The massive asset purchase programme under Ueda’s predecessor Haruhiko Kuroda has also left the BoJ owning more than half of Japan’s government bonds and locally listed exchange traded fund assets. The paper losses for its bond holdings will increase substantially as interest rates rise, but these are unlikely to translate into realised losses since the bonds can be held to maturity. ETFs, on the other hand, do not mature so the BoJ, now the biggest investor in Japanese stocks, faces a hit if shares decline sharply. Despite raising its target for annual ETF purchases to ¥12tn ($90bn) in 2020 to support the economy during the pandemic, the BoJ has significantly scaled back the buying and has acquired ¥140bn this year.  “As an ETF exit strategy has the potential to destabilise the stock market, the BoJ is likely to treat it with special care, and the start of full-fledged discussions on this issue may not get under way until well into governor Ueda’s term,” Naohiko Baba, Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report.  Another major risk factor is a potential recession in the US if inflation remains high and the Federal Reserve goes back to raising rates aggressively, which would once again put selling pressure on the yen.  A spillover slowdown of the Japanese economy could kill inflation momentum, just as prices rises have started to broaden beyond the boost in imported energy costs caused by the war in Ukraine. In March, so-called core-core consumer prices, excluding all food and energy, rose 2.3 per cent, throwing doubt on the BoJ’s argument that inflation is not driven by underlying consumer demand and is likely to fall below its target later this year. “We’re starting to say this time may be different,” said UBS economist Masamichi Adachi, citing bigger than expected salary increases agreed by large companies and businesses’ willingness to raise prices to reflect increased costs. “But we’re not yet in a position where we can confidently say that this time is different.”","27.04.2023"
"Jack Dorsey: Hindenburg’s latest target after Adani","Plus, private credit investors dig through Silicon Valley Bank’s loan book and Toshiba’s take-private deal inches towards the finish line","One scoop to start: Executive pay at Silicon Valley Bank soared after the bank implemented a strategy to boost profitability by buying riskier assets exposed to rising interest rates, according to a Financial Times analysis of securities filings and people familiar with the matter.  In today’s newsletter Hindenburg targets Jack Dorsey’s BlockPrivate credit picks through the SVB wreckageToshiba shareholders approve a take-private offer Hindenburg sounds off on Dorsey’s Cash App US short seller Hindenburg Research has earned a reputation for its long, detailed reports on companies it has taken a negative view on.   But the firm has gone the extra mile on its latest target. As part of its report on Block, the payments group run by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, Hindenburg included a rap video.  The compilation shows how Cash App, Block’s mobile payments product, is referenced in various songs for its use in illegal activities. “A review of those songs show that the artists are not generally rapping about Cash App’s smooth user interface,” the report states. It’s the latest bombshell report from Hindenburg, the short seller founded by Nathan Anderson, which has bet that Block’s share price will go down. Block, led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, said it would work with the Securities and Exchange Commission to explore legal action against Hindenburg © AFP/Getty Images Hindenburg alleges that Block has artificially inflated its user numbers and claimed that what it referred to as Block’s “wild west” approach had led it to become a popular service for criminals to process transactions. The company’s shares fell by as much as 20 per cent after the report was released.  Block released a statement calling the report “factually inaccurate” and “misleading”, adding that it was considering legal action.  The small team at Hindenburg has been busy of late. In January it released a report on Indian conglomerate Adani Group, accusing it of “pulling the largest con in corporate history”, which helped wipe about $100bn off its market valuation.   These types of reports take a lot of time, so it’s unusual to see them released back to back. But it makes sense that Hindenburg would want to capitalise on the publicity it has received since it made its allegations against Adani, which triggered a worldwide media storm.   While the majority of Hindenburg’s allegations are focused on the Cash App, Block operates several other businesses, including streaming platform Tidal, which it bought from Dorsey’s close friend Jay-Z in 2021. (Jay-Z sits on Block’s board.)  It was a surprising move, but some people have since speculated that Dorsey agreed to buy Tidal because of how popular Cash App is with the hip-hop community.  Perhaps more surprising, though, is the fact that a compilation music video of rap songs posted by a short seller has garnered more than 18,000 views on YouTube.  Private credit pokes around SVB’s loan book For days, big players in the private credit industry hoping to take a peak at Silicon Valley Bank’s $74bn loan book were stuck in the dark. But as they have finally been allowed into the so-called data room, they’re finding giant portions of the portfolio aren’t actually all that appealing.  Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, Sixth Street and HPS Investment Partners are among the alternative investment groups inspecting SVB’s loans to prepare possible offers, sources tell DD’s Eric Platt.  “The FDIC is really in a challenging situation,” said a person involved in the bidding process. It is “such a unique book of business compared to any other [bank]”. The largest portion of the loan book, worth $41.3bn at the end of 2022, consists primarily of so-called subscription lines SVB offered to private equity and venture capital funds. It could also prove to be the hardest for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell, several people who studied the loan book said. That’s in part because the yields on the loans are quite low, with one rival saying SVB was offering clients better rates by the tune of 1 to 2 percentage points. At the same time, many big providers of subscription lines — such as Citigroup and Wells Fargo — are scaling back their businesses.  SVB also has about $6.7bn of loans to early and growth-stage companies that it has warned are only likely to be repaid on an exit, such as an initial public offering, a sale of the company or a new funding round. That book could attract venture debt lenders, but may prove less interesting to the big private credit shops. Instead, they’re focusing mostly on about $10bn to $12bn worth of loans that SVB had made to companies such as doctors’ office network Oak Street Health, robotics group Automation Anywhere and fintech group DailyPay. They’re relatively more mature businesses and could fit well into existing private credit portfolios. The FDIC is still hoping that it will entice a bank to pick up most of SVB’s deposits and loans, but the fact that two auctions have struggled has signalled the challenge facing the regulator.  “There’s this mythical, enormous loan book,” said one person involved in the process. “It’s complicated because it’s huge. Everyone is scurrying around, looking for a partner or needs an insurance arm.” Toshiba’s take-private drama enters the final countdown The Toshiba saga has had a good eight-year run, but could finally be nearing the finish line now that the 147-year-old conglomerate’s board has approved a $15bn buyout from a consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners.  After lurching from crisis to crisis since it was caught in an accounting scandal in 2015, the long-fought transaction could mark a new chapter in Japan’s economy and reinforce private equity’s increasing grip on the market. Global heavyweights including KKR, Bain Capital, Blackstone and Carlyle have increased their presence in the world’s third-largest economy over the years, in part due to a growing succession crisis where many companies don’t have replacements for their ageing founders. The saga, which has enlisted a sizeable proportion of all the M&A bankers, lawyers, buyout funds and shareholder activists in Tokyo, has involved the $18bn fire sale of Toshiba Memory to a consortium led by Bain, a $5.4bn equity raising engineered by Goldman Sachs, a three-way split proposal from UBS and advisory work from many others.  One investor noted that the premium being offered by JIP seemed extremely low, but that there were probably investors ready to jump on their chance to exit. “If the shareholders go for it, it’s quite a low-key end to this story, after everything,” he said. But this story has delivered far too many twists and turns to be sure of anything until it’s done.

"Spanish court upholds Andrea Orcel’s Santander claim but cuts payout by €8mn","Bank ordered to pay €43.5mn in compensation for aborted offer but will appeal to Supreme Court","A Madrid court has upheld Andrea Orcel’s multimillion-euro lawsuit against Santander but cut the amount the bank has to pay by €8mn, in the latest twist in the long-running battle between Spain’s biggest lender and one of Europe’s best-known bankers. The court awarded Orcel €43.5mn in compensation for Santander’s aborted offer for the Italian to become chief executive in 2018. The bank had appealed against an initial award by a judge in January 2022. The bank said it welcomed the “decision to significantly reduce the amounts awarded by Mr Orcel” but that it would appeal against the ruling to Spain’s Supreme Court.  Santander added that despite the court awarding Orcel €43.5mn, what he ends up receiving will be up to a third lower because of a fall in the bank’s share price and it failing to hit total shareholder return targets. As much as €18.6mn of the payout was linked to Santander’s shares in a long-term incentive scheme. “From the outset this case was about securing the truth and establishing the importance of acting with honesty and integrity,” Orcel said. “I am pleased that today’s ruling vindicates truth and justice by proving incontrovertibly for the second time in a court of law that there was a fundamental breach of contract by Santander as we have always argued.” Orcel brought the case in 2019 and initially sought €112mn, based on a combination of lost salary and bonus from Santander, lost long-term incentives from his previous employer, UBS, and compensation “for moral and reputational damages”. He later halved his claim and was eventually awarded €51.4mn in January 2022. The five judges overseeing the appeal upheld Orcel’s claim over the validity of his employment contract but reduced his payout for moral damages from €10mn to €2mn. The case relates to an offer Santander made to Orcel in 2018 to become chief executive, which the bank withdrew weeks later after the former Merrill Lynch dealmaker had resigned from his position as head of UBS’s investment bank. Orcel alleged that the bank’s reversal of the decision it made in September 2018 constituted a breach of contract. In arguments ultimately rejected by the court, Santander claimed Orcel’s offer letter did not amount to a contract under Spanish law.  The long-running legal fight has proved an unwanted distraction for Ana Botín, executive chair of the Spanish lender, whose tenure since succeeding her father, Emilio Botín, has been marked by the decision first to hire Orcel, long a confidant of her family, and then to drop him.","06.02.2023"
"US debt ceiling debacle adds to economists’ fears of turmoil","Concerns grow that growth and jobs will suffer as impasse drags on in Congress","Economists are becoming increasingly concerned that the US will generate fresh turbulence in the coming weeks when it hits its debt ceiling and is unable to pay all its bills.  With the two main political parties unable to agree an increase in the $31.4tn ceiling on US federal debt, Janet Yellen, Treasury secretary, has warned that stop-gap measures to circumvent the limit will run out of road as soon as June 1.  At that point, the US federal government would face various unpalatable options, ranging from delaying payments to contractors, Social Security recipients, Medicare providers or agencies; to defaults on payments on US government debt. It could also carry on spending programmes in defiance of the ceiling.   In any of these scenarios, analysts believe a political, financial and economic crisis would be hard to avoid.  While the congressional disputes are the most serious for at least a decade, Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens’ College at Cambridge university, said the expectation was still that a last-minute deal would be struck between Democrats and Republicans. If that failed, “we should expect another layer of financial volatility in a system that has already lost many of its anchors”.  “It would come at a time when the global system is facing growth and inflation headwinds, and is also keen to contain the banking tremors to a particular sector of the US system.” Nathan Sheets, global head of international economics at Citigroup and a former US Treasury official, said: “It amplifies all the other concerns that people have.” There was a “multiplicative kind of effect with the debt ceiling, where people are a little more on edge and they’re a little bit more nervous about this kind of systemic risk”. The last time the US was so close to hitting the debt ceiling was in 2011. Even though a deal was eventually struck, four days later Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, stripped the AAA rating from US government debt. The downgrade sent US share prices down more than 5 per cent in a day and exacerbated the deepening eurozone crisis.  Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that in some ways, particularly with lower unemployment, the US economy was stronger now. However, hitting the debt ceiling would still mark a destabilising blow. “If you have a flu, you don’t want to get hit by a bus. But you never want to get hit by a bus,” he said. “Even if the economy is looking a little bit different [than 2011], it’s going to be a bad situation.”  The exact consequences of a repeat flirtation with breaking the debt ceiling are impossible to estimate with any precision. But officials in the US think they would be serious.  Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell at last week’s press conference: ‘We shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the US doesn’t pay its bills’ © Kim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Shutterstock Speaking at a press conference this week, Fed chair Jay Powell underscored that failing to raise the limit would pitch the US economy into “unchartered territory”. The consequences were not only very uncertain but also “could be quite high”. “We shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the US doesn’t pay its bills. It shouldn’t be a thing. No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy and financial system and our reputation from the damage that such an event might inflict.” In 2011, the US Treasury had a plan to ensure that the government did not default on its obligations to Treasury bondholders by cutting spending. But this implies huge cuts, which could send the US economy into recession and weigh on global growth.  According to the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, a protracted US default “would likely lead to severe damage to the economy, with job growth swinging from its current pace of robust gains to losses numbering in the millions”. They forecast an “immediate, sharp recession” with the intensity of the downturn seen during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  Even a default that is corrected quickly could prompt a sharp drop in growth. Economists from Moody’s warn that 2mn jobs could be lost under such a scenario.   Economists at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, cautioned in a recent report that even a shortlived impasse would lead to “sustained — and completely avoidable — damage”. Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner, the authors, said the extent of the damage depended in large part on how the government chose to prioritise its payments — something that would inevitably result in legal challenges.  El-Erian said the financial effects of a default on debt were “potentially bigger” than delaying other government payments, but even in the latter scenario, “there would be concern about the potential economic spillovers”. With so much at stake, analysts have begun to pepper notes to clients with warnings.  Evan Brown and Luke Kawa, at Swiss lender UBS, said any default on US debt would constitute a “major financial crisis” and would therefore be unlikely because the Treasury would prioritise honouring its obligations. Ironically, a downturn in growth could boost US government bond prices as it would lead markets to price in more interest rate cuts from the Fed later this year. Bank of America analysts have said, while reports of the replacement of the dominant role of the greenback in global transactions were “greatly exaggerated”, defaults from a debt ceiling showdown “would compromise the dollar’s attractiveness as a store of value”.","07.05.2023"
"The $17bn battle over Credit Suisse’s debt","Hong Kong and Singapore compete for offshore funds and rival hoteliers square off","One scoop to start: British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe was poised to make a bid that valued England’s Manchester United Football Club at more than £5bn on Wednesday night, a record acquisition price for a sports team.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter Distressed debt investors fight back against the SwissAsia vies for offshore fundsA hotel dealmaking drama US debt investors vs Switzerland David Tepper is one of the best distressed debt investors of his generation.  During the last financial crisis, he famously made billions of dollars betting that US banks would not be nationalised. But his wager on the most recent banking crisis hasn’t worked out as well. Tepper is among a group of investors who bought up tranches of Credit Suisse’s junior and senior debt as the Swiss lender spiralled into chaos. But the fate of one class of debt he bought, known as additional tier one bonds or AT1s, was sealed after the Swiss government used an emergency ordinance to write down the bonds to zero, while the bank’s shareholders got $3.2bn. Typically equity is wiped out before AT1s. Now Tepper and a group of US distressed debt investors are preparing to sue the Swiss lender, with help from lawyers at firms including Quinn Emanuel and Pallas, for its eleventh-hour decision to wipe out $17bn of AT1s as part of UBS’s emergency takeover. “If this is left to stand, how can you trust any debt security issued in Switzerland, or for that matter wider Europe, if governments can just change laws after the fact,” the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management told the FT. “Contracts are made to be honoured.” AT1s, as DD explained earlier this week, were introduced after 2008 to help banks bolster their balance sheets by shifting some of the risk away from depositors and on to bondholders.  They are designed to essentially self-destruct when a bank’s capital ratio falls below a certain level, automatically strengthening it in times of distress and benefiting creditors with higher-ranking claims, such as owners of senior debt. However, as the Swiss takeover saga has exemplified, these bonds can also apparently be wiped out with a flick of the pen by regulators. (Axiom Alternative Investments’ Jérôme Legras’s Alphaville provides a helpful explainer.) The fiasco has also led some of Asia’s biggest banks to second-guess their own issuance of risky bank debt, the FT reports. Major lenders in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong are placing new AT1 bond deals on hold until market conditions stabilise, according to people familiar with the plans.  The fallout from the CS deal “changes the whole nature of the [AT1] market,” said Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer of PGIM Fixed Income. “Basically, it’s a zombie market going forward in my mind.”  Not everyone is sympathetic to the bondholders burnt by Swiss regulators. “Those who profit from opportunities should also take their share when risks materialise,” Germany’s central bank boss Joachim Nagel told the FT in an interview on Wednesday.  Even as CS bondholders mourn their losses, it isn’t exactly the best time to be a shareholder, either. UBS paid just $3.25bn for CS, a sliver of its original value. The past few weeks have been a searing reminder that it’s tough to be a bank shareholder in general, writes Unhedged’s Ethan Wu. Unless, of course, it’s UBS. Hong Kong vs Singapore: the race for offshore funds Private equity firms, hedge funds and the world’s super-rich have long parked their funds in offshore jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands, Mauritius and the Cayman Islands. Hong Kong and Singapore are trying to change that, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Mercedes Ruehl, Leo Lewis and Chan Ho-him report. For the past few years, Asia’s rival financial hubs have quietly created new financial structures that they hope will transform the flows of capital around the world. The idea is simple: they want to keep the low tax and privacy of offshore funds, but have both the funds and their managers in the same country. Hong Kong moved first. After the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks in 2016 and 2017 sparked global news coverage of the use and abuse of Caribbean offshore funds, the territory spotted its chance to create an alternative. In 2018 it launched the “open-ended fund company”, known as an OFC. But adoption was low: just eight were registered in the first two years. One thing limiting the scheme’s take-up is that many Chinese investors prefer to put their money in Singapore, Hong Kong-based advisers say privately, which they regard as being further from Beijing’s reach. In 2020 Singapore set up its own version, the “variable capital company” or VCC. It took off: 872 VCCs were registered in the city-state as of February. The stakes are high. The rival financial hubs are trying to lure away the best bits of the Caribbean islands’ lucrative business without also risking the public backlash they have faced for facilitating tax avoidance.  They also need to avoid attracting capital from sanctioned groups, money launderers and others who might be drawn to the lack of public disclosure. The names of shareholders aren’t public, which one lawyer who has established the vehicles said was “very important because if I was a shareholder and had money in multiple VCCs, I wouldn’t want people to know where I’d invested”. It’s not always clear who’s using these, and why — even, in some cases, to the people who set them up. “It’s not that we have a fixed idea yet of what might be coming under this umbrella,” said one fund manager who set up an OFC in January. “We just want to be ready to say ‘yes’ if, say, a Chinese tycoon calls us and says they want to put some capital into this kind of structure.” Drama takes up residence at duelling hotel empires In just a decade, entrepreneur Sharan Pasricha has taken hotel group Ennismore from a single London outpost to a global luxury hotel colossus. (With a little help from his Indian telecoms billionaire father-in-law Sunil Bharti Mittal, and his co-owner, French hotel giant Accor.) But it appears even Pasricha’s charm has its limits. Earlier this week, rival hotelier Andrew Zobler, the man behind the five-star NoMad hotel, accused the Ennismore founder of trying to “sabotage” efforts to find a buyer for half of his hotel group Sydell. Zobler is seeking damages of about $30mn as part of a case filed in New York. In 2017, Zobler went looking for outside investment to replace his longtime business partner, US billionaire Ron Burkle, after a dramatic falling out between the pair. When he decided to partner with MGM Resorts International instead of Pasricha on a deal to buy Burkle out, Zobler alleges, this led to Pasricha’s “overly emotional and malicious reaction”. Pasricha then broke a confidentiality agreement and approached Burkle’s investment fund Yucaipa directly in “a calculated attempt to foist himself into the Sydell businesses”, according to the lawsuit. Pasricha revealed to Burkle that Sydell was partnering with MGM on the buyout deal, giving Yucaipa the licence to exert pressure on MGM to pay a higher price for the stake. This cost Zobler and Sydell a $15mn payout from MGM which was conditional on them securing a lower price for the deal. Pasricha and Ennismore are yet to file a response to the lawsuit. “Zobler’s claims are completely baseless and nothing more than a desperate attempt by a repeat litigator to misuse the judicial system to gain financially,” said an Ennismore spokesperson. “We deny the matters raised and will defend vigorously against these meritless claims.” Job moves UK law firm Slaughter and May has promoted 10 new partners.Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the blank-cheque company that plans to take Donald Trump’s media business public, has ousted its chief executive Patrick Orlando.Citigroup has named Robin Rousseau and Barry Weir as co-heads of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, replacing Alison Harding-Jones.

"FirstFT: First Republic deposit withdrawals hit $100bn","Also in today’s newsletter, Biden launches his re-election campaign and retail investors snap up Treasuries","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  The future of the San Francisco bank First Republic is looking very uncertain this morning after it revealed customers pulled $100bn of deposits in the first quarter. Shares in the lender plunged 20 per cent after the market closed as the bank revealed its deposits fell from $176bn to $74bn by the end of the first quarter — excluding an emergency injection of $30bn from larger lenders.  The bank also announced plans to reduce its workforce by 25 per cent, cut back on office space and halt dividend payments as it assesses its “strategic options”.  The news came as it revealed profits tumbled by a third in the first quarter to $229mn. First Republic suffered the catastrophic collapse of deposits last month following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank which were seized by regulators and forced into the arms of buyers at a deep discount. Shares in First Republic, which have fallen 86 per cent this year, closed up 12 per cent yesterday at $16 but are trading down heavily in pre-market trading and weighing on the outlook for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

"Record buyback spree attracts shareholder complaints","Purchases by the world’s biggest 1,200 companies triple in a decade to rival dividends in scale","Record levels of share buybacks are attracting complaints from a growing number of prominent investors concerned that the practice is boosting executive bonuses but providing only limited benefits to shareholders. The world’s 1,200 biggest public companies collectively bought back a record $1.3tn of their own shares last year, triple the level of a decade ago and almost as much as they paid out to shareholders in dividends, according to research by asset manager Janus Henderson. By contrast, total dividends have grown by just 54 per cent in the past 10 years. The trend has continued this year, with new share purchases announced by companies including HSBC, Apple, Airbnb and caterer Compass. Oil was the sector with the largest amount of share buybacks last year, according to Janus Henderson; companies repurchased $135bn of their stock — four times as much as 2021.  Buybacks are a way for companies to return excess cash to shareholders, and can boost their share price, but the scale of the activity is increasingly attracting the interest of regulators.  US President Joe Biden introduced a 1 per cent tax on Wall Street buybacks that came into force in January; he has recently proposed to quadruple it. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved a rule that will require publicly traded companies to disclose more information on their buybacks, such as the number purchased and average price paid.  “We would prefer buybacks to be less prevalent,” said Euan Munro, chief executive of Newton Investment Management.  “Used badly, [buybacks] can be used to manipulate [earnings per share] numbers upwards to meet medium-term management incentive targets at the expense of investments that might be important to a company’s long- term health,” he said. Daniel Peris, a fund manager at Pittsburgh-based Federated Hermes, called buybacks an “environmental hazard”.  “The dividend is just the dividend: grandma benefits, the long-term holder [benefits]. Buybacks benefit traders, hedge funds, senior executives [and] near-term share prices.” Leigh Himsworth, a UK equity fund manager at Fidelity, said: “As a shareholder you feel like you never actually get the reward” with buybacks. “If the market is nonplussed by it then, as a shareholder, you are worse than square one, as the company has typically used up their cash.” Abrie Pretorius, a manager at Ninety One, said: “Buybacks only create value for remaining shareholders and strong relative performance when shares are cheap and there are no better uses of that cash which would generate higher returns. Most buybacks help optical [earnings per share] growth but destroy value.” Buybacks also do not always translate into better share price performance. An Invesco fund that tracks the price of companies that do large buybacks has underperformed the US market over the past decade. Share repurchases have traditionally been more common in the US stock market than in the UK or Europe, but they are on the rise worldwide. Between 2012 and 2022, repurchases by the biggest UK-listed companies more than tripled from $22bn to $70bn. US-listed companies increased buybacks from $333bn to $932bn, while in Europe share purchases more than doubled to $148bn.  “The approach we have seen in the US to generally prefer buybacks could be problematic if it takes root in the UK,” said Michael Stiasny, M&G’s head of UK equities. “The likely outcome would be that the market ends up yielding permanently less than it could.” Nevertheless, some investors prefer buybacks to dividends, for instance because they may pay lower tax than on a dividend and can control the timing of when the tax is due.   “I don’t know how we’ve gotten to this point politically, but the idea that buybacks are a bad thing, or simply a way to manipulate your stock, I don’t think could be further from the truth,” said Jim Tierney, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein who focuses on growth stocks. Lindsell Train co-founder Nick Train said that the benefit of buybacks depended on the purchase price, but they could be “a wonderful way for a board to build enhanced wealth for long-term shareholders”. Bernard Ahkong, co-chief investment officer at UBS Asset Management’s hedge fund unit O’Connor, said: “We don’t want companies to boost dividends in an unsustainable fashion only to then have to cut them say one year later — and there would be less negative fallout from doing a one-off buyback, for example.” On Friday, the US Chamber of Commerce sued the SEC in an effort to block its plan to require more buyback disclosure. “Stock buybacks play an important role in the functioning of healthy and efficient capital markets,” said Neil Bradley, the chamber’s vice-president and chief policy officer. Some analysts expect the flurry of activity to taper off. Goldman Sachs forecasts that spending on buybacks by US S&P 500 companies will this year drop 15 per cent to $808bn and dividends will rise 5 per cent to $628bn as weak earnings growth constrains the total payout to investors, although next year it expects buybacks to rise again.   David Kostin, Goldman’s chief US equity strategist, said: “The slowdown in US earnings growth, the increase in policy uncertainty following the recent banking stress, and high starting valuations at which to repurchase stock all pose headwinds to buybacks.” Sharp declines in US companies’ cash holdings have limited their ability to pursue buybacks, while rising interest rates have removed the incentive to fund them with debt, he said, adding that Biden’s buyback tax was unlikely to have a notable effect.

"Nasdaq records best quarter since 2020 after volatile start to year","Tech-heavy US index gains 17% in first three months of 2023 as investors shed interest rate worries","The Nasdaq Composite stock index has closed out its best quarter since 2020, buoyed from bets on Big Tech companies by investors who rolled back expectations for higher interest rates.  The tech-heavy index gained 16.8 per cent in the first three months of 2023 after rising 1.7 per cent on Friday. That marked the Nasdaq’s strongest quarter since the second quarter of 2020, when tech stocks led a sharp rebound from a plunge at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The broader S&P 500 index was also lifted by the strength in tech, adding 1.4 per cent on Friday to bring its quarterly increase to 7 per cent.  The moves capped what has been a volatile start to the year, with a strong January followed by a weak February and a rebound over the past few weeks. Most recently, stock markets have picked up despite concerns about the health of the banking sector following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and other regional lenders in March. SVB’s failure and the fallout — including the forced merger of Credit Suisse and UBS — have convinced investors that the US Federal Reserve will not keep raising interest rates to fight inflation, boosting shares in large tech stocks heavily weighted in benchmark indices. “The narrative has changed dramatically with the tug of war between the Fed and market participants,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at the Colony Group, a $19bn wealth manager.   Lower interest rates increase the appeal of companies that promise long-term growth. Mega-cap tech groups such as Microsoft and Apple are also seen as less exposed to a potential downturn in bank lending if difficulties in the regional banking sector continue. In contrast, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies and the equal-weighted S&P 500 have declined for the past two months.  “Although there’s been a lot of big winners, the average stock is lingering,” Steinberg added.   Data released on Friday strengthened investor confidence about the outlook for rates. The core personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation — softened in February to a year-on-year rise of 4.6 per cent, slightly lower than consensus forecasts. Myles Bradshaw, head of global aggregate strategies at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the market “now sees rates as already having peaked and anticipates rate cuts by year-end”, though the central bank has continued to predict at least one more rate rise and no cuts until 2024. US government bond yields declined on Friday, with the yield on the policy-sensitive two-year Treasury falling 0.07 percentage points to 4.03 per cent. The 10-year yield fell 0.08 percentage points to 3.48 per cent. Bond yields fall when prices rise. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of six peers, strengthened 0.4 per cent.  Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 rose 0.6 per cent after eurozone inflation fell more than expected, leaving the index up 6.7 per cent for the quarter.  Europe’s harmonised index of consumer prices slowed from 8.5 per cent in February to 6.9 per cent in the year to March as energy costs receded. Economists had expected prices to rise 7.1 per cent.   Analysts said the figures were unlikely to deter the European Central Bank from raising rates by a quarter percentage point to 3.25 per cent when it meets on May 4.  Asian equities also advanced on Friday, buoyed by stronger than expected economic data in China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.4 per cent, and China’s CSI 300 rose 0.3 per cent. South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Topix each advanced 1 per cent. Activity in China’s non-manufacturing sectors grew at its fastest rate in more than a decade in March as business confidence rocketed and demand grew steadily, according to a closely watched official gauge.  “This strength won’t be sustained indefinitely, however,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. Much of the immediate boost from dismantling Covid-19 restrictions has “already passed” and the recovery is “likely to moderate over the coming months”, he said.","31.03.2023"
"Several Federal Reserve officials considered forgoing rate rise last month","US central bank ultimately decided to press ahead with tightening campaign despite banking turmoil","Several Federal Reserve officials considered forgoing an interest rate rise last month amid the worst banking turmoil since the 2008 crisis, but ultimately decided to press ahead due to persistently high inflation, according to an account of their most recent meeting. Minutes from the March gathering, at which the US central bank raised its benchmark policy rate by a quarter-point, showed the Fed was chiefly focused on persistent price pressures — even after the recent banking turbulence upended expectations about the trajectory of the economy. The rate rise, which lifted the federal funds rate to a new target range of 4.75-5 per cent, came on the heels of a trio of bank failures in the US as well as the forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.  Government authorities including the Fed stepped in aggressively to ward off further contagion, injecting doubt as to whether the central bank would follow through with a rate rise in March. The Fed officials who considered a pause noted that it would give them more time to assess the effect of the banking stress on the economy and financial system, the minutes showed. Their deliberations came as Fed staffers for the first time predicted a “mild recession” starting later this year before the economy recovers over the next two years.  However, the officials in question decided the Fed and other agencies had done enough to “calm conditions in the banking sector and lessen the near-term risks to economic activity and inflation”. They cited high inflation and strong economic data as reasons for pressing ahead with the rate increase. During the press conference that followed the March decision, chair Jay Powell acknowledged officials had considered pausing the monetary tightening campaign. But he said policymakers had decided it was more important for the Fed to maintain public confidence in its commitment to rooting out high inflation “with our actions as well as our words”. Before the turbulence engulfed the banking sector, Powell had even floated the idea of reverting to a half-point rate rise following a number of unexpectedly strong economic data that suggested more work needed to be done to damp demand.  According to the minutes, some officials said they would have considered a half-point rate rise “in the absence of the recent development in the banking sector”. “However, due to the potential for banking sector developments to tighten financial conditions . . . they judged it prudent to increase the target range by a smaller increment at this meeting,” the record said. In future, several participants said the Fed needed to “retain flexibility and optionality” given the “highly uncertain economic outlook”.  For the most part, officials expect the banking stress will lead to tighter credit conditions, which could weigh on business activity, hiring and consumer spending. That has altered expectations about how much more the Fed needs to cool economic activity. Powell last month likened a looming credit crunch to the Fed’s rate rises in its ability to squeeze the economy but said the magnitude of any tightening effect was highly uncertain. To account for this, the Federal Open Market Committee changed its policy statement, removing the oft-repeated warning that “ongoing increases” would be necessary to bring soaring inflation under control.  Rather, the committee said “some additional policy firming may be appropriate” to bring inflation back to the bank’s 2 per cent target. Powell later urged reporters to focus on the “some” and “may” in that phrase.  Prior to the banking turmoil, many officials saw the policy rate path being “somewhat higher” than earlier estimates in light of stronger than expected data, the minutes indicated.  Still, most officials pencilled in one final quarter-point rate rise this year, per projections published last month, which would lift the fed funds rate above 5 per cent and maintain that level at least until 2024. Officials have insisted there would be no rate cuts in 2023.  In recent appearances, most Fed officials have signalled support for one more rate increase, but divisions have emerged.  Speaking on Wednesday, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said she would be monitoring the effect of the banking stress closely but that “the strength of the economy and the elevated readings on inflation suggest that there is more work to do”.  That followed comments from John Williams, president of the New York Fed, who on Tuesday said another rate rise was a “reasonable starting point” given there had not yet been a significant tightening of credit conditions. However, Austan Goolsbee, the newly appointed president of the Chicago Fed, recently adopted a much more cautious tone, warning of a “material impact on the real economy” that could suggest monetary policy “has to do less” than initially expected.","12.04.2023"
"European real estate stocks hammered by banking turmoil  ","Shares on track for worst month in years as investors bet on plummeting property valuations","Shares in European real estate groups are on track for their worst month since the start of the pandemic, as investors bet that weeks of banking turmoil will tighten access to credit and send property valuations plummeting. The MSCI Europe Real Estate index of large and mid-cap property companies has tumbled close to its lowest level since early 2009 following a 24 per cent decline so far in March, massively underperforming the region-wide Stoxx 600 equity index, which is down 2.4 per cent over the same period.  Analysts and investors have worried for months about the impact of rising interest rates on the commercial real estate sector on both sides of the Atlantic, but those fears have crystallised since the failure of California-based lender Silicon Valley Bank in early March and the forced sale of Credit Suisse to rival UBS a little over a week later.   Some now expect a looming credit crunch will curtail financing to property groups, many of which are already struggling with higher debt costs and flatlining occupancy rates. Northern European real estate is a “zero-rate addicted sector” and a potential “bubble” that might burst once higher interest rates are properly factored into property valuations, according to London-based Andromeda Capital Management. Rating agency Moody’s this week said refinancing risk in the sector had “significantly increased”, with companies holding debt maturing in the next few years likely to come under particular pressure from higher interest payments.  “Low interest rates have been a subsidy for commercial real estate for 15 years. This is a giant reset for the industry,” said Ron Dickerman, president of Madison International Realty. “All real estate is likely worth less now than it was six or 12 months ago.”   Property valuations are down about 10 per cent from their peak in June 2022, according to the MSCI European Quarterly Property Index. Citigroup forecasts that valuations in western Europe will drop by a further 20 to 40 per cent before the end of next year, while real estate stocks could halve in value over the same period. Shares in German real estate group Vonovia have fallen 30 per cent since the start of March to the lowest level on record, with Luxembourg’s Aroundtown, France’s Gecina and UK-based Segro down 42 per cent, 13 per cent and 9 per cent in the past four weeks respectively.  Goldman Sachs last week downgraded British Land to “sell”, citing the group’s heavy asset exposure to the City of London, where many companies have adopted hybrid working models since the outbreak of Covid-19.  Agnès Belaisch, chief European strategist at the Barings Investment Institute, said Europe’s real estate sector should brace for “a lot more” interest rate rises given that the European Central Bank, unlike the US Federal Reserve, “seems undeterred by financial stress and confident that the region’s banks are well capitalised and liquid”. US real estate groups have so far fared slightly better than those in Europe. The MSCI US real estate investment trust index has fallen 8.5 per cent since the start of the month, despite domestic property companies’ reliance for funding on the very regional banks at the centre of investors’ concerns. “In Europe, lending to property groups is concentrated in the larger banks”, Belaisch said. The composition of the US and European property indices might account for some of the difference in performance, according to Mark Unsworth, head of real estate economics at Oxford Economics. “The US has a much more mature listed real estate universe”, he said, with Reits specialising in alternatives like data centres, self-storage and healthcare comprising a larger share. “Europe will be more exposed to offices, industrial and retail where the relative impact [of higher rates] is expected to be greater”. Even so, Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said that in a worst-case scenario a “doom loop” could develop between smaller banks and commercial property, where worries about banks’ viability leads to deposit flight, forcing lenders to call in commercial real estate loans — “a key part” of their asset base.  Private lenders, too, might find themselves caught out. In December, US private equity group Blackstone limited withdrawals from its $125bn private property fund following a surge in redemption requests.  ","30.03.2023"

An explosion in the number of ETFs that invest according to environmental, social and governance principles is fuelling concern among regulators that fund managers are “greenwashing”: using misleading environmental claims to entice well-meaning customers.  Exchange traded funds that use ESG metrics to inform investment decisions have developed into a key driver of new business for asset managers as more investors seek strategies that can deliver returns from doing good. As a result, the number of ETFs carrying an ESG label more than doubled in the past two years, reaching almost 1,300 at the end of 2022, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.   But all these ESG ETFs differ in their approach, ranging from “dark green” funds — designed to be compatible with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C — to index trackers that retain significant exposures to fossil fuel companies, and to a wide variety of “thematics” that target specific ESG priorities. The speed of product proliferation means that investors have to do their homework with real care to ensure that they choose an ESG ETF that matches their needs and expectationsDeborah Fuhr, founder of consultancy ETFGI. “The speed of product proliferation means that investors have to do their homework with real care to ensure that they choose an ESG ETF that matches their needs and expectations,” says Deborah Fuhr, the founder of ETFGI. ESG ETFs held global assets worth $394bn at the end of last year after registering net investor inflows of $74.7bn during 2022 — a drop of 54.5 per cent on the $164.3bn gathered over the previous 12 months, according to ETFGI.  That decline in new business for ESG ETFs last year was significantly larger than the wider 33.7 per cent drop recorded in the ETF industry’s overall net inflows.  This suggests that an increasingly fractious debate over ESG standards — along with mounting attacks by US Republican politicians — has started to damp investor demand. Republican governors from at least 19 US states have pledged to resist ESG investing, over antitrust, consumer protection and discrimination concerns.  Fund managers, on the other hand, complain that incomplete disclosures by companies, particularly regarding environmental data, combined with shifting regulatory requirements, have created real difficulties for product designers.  Problems are also evident in Europe, home to ESG ETFs holding $253bn-worth of assets. Possible accusations of greenwashing have prompted asset managers, including BlackRock, Amundi and UBS, to remove ETFs from the EU’s strictest ESG category, known as “Article 9”, which covers funds that hold sustainable investments or which target reductions in carbon emissions.    Amin Rajan, chief executive of the investment consultancy Create Research, says the reclassification of multiple Article 9 funds “shows that greenwashing was occurring but it remains difficult to say if this was deliberate or unintentional”.  However, the downgrading of almost all ETFs tracking Paris-Aligned Benchmark (PAB) and Climate Transition Benchmark (CTB) indices prompted the European Commission to issue a clarification this month. Fund managers will be permitted to carry out their own assessments for sustainable investments and they must also disclose their methodology, according to the Commission.  Raza Naeem, a partner at the law firm Linklaters, says the new guidance would be “welcomed by the [fund] industry, although some will likely think this has come too late”. Hortense Bioy, global director of sustainability research at the data provider Morningstar, believes managers in Europe will want to be seen as sustainability-focused, so there will now be commercial pressures on them to reclassify their funds as Article 9. “Some asset managers will be relieved that the Commission has decided against imposing minimum standards, as the onus remains on product providers to determine the level of sustainable investments in each of their funds based on their own methodologies,” she says. “Some other managers would prefer to have seen minimum requirements, as that would have levelled the playing field and been easier for end-investors.  “Investors will now have to do more due diligence to understand the methodologies used. Investors may also be confused by the flip-flopping that we are likely to see over fund classification.”  The ESG investment backlash begins to have an impact | FT Moral Money Even more changes could follow. Europe’s top three financial regulators this month proposed additional changes to disclosure and reporting requirements that would require investment products labelled as “sustainable” to carry more information about decarbonisation targets and how they will be achieved.  UK regulators appear anxious to avoid the problems that have bedevilled the development of the ESG market in Europe. The Financial Conduct Authority is consulting on the introduction of a new set of consumer-friendly labels for sustainable investments. It has proposed restrictions on investment managers using terms such as “green” and “ESG” in fund marketing documents.  In March, the FCA also issued a blunt warning to index providers that they were fuelling greenwashing after identifying “widespread failings” in ESG-related disclosures. It has said ESG ratings providers should be formally regulated, too. “We are witnessing the birth pangs of a new form of investing which involves big value judgments,” says Rajan. “The definition of a ‘good company’ varies greatly between different countries and cultures. ESG data disclosures and reporting will improve due to pressure from investors, regulators and company directors who have a fiduciary duty to shareholders.”  Climate CapitalWhere climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here.Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets here ate ","24.04.2023"

Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  Boutique advisory firm Centerview Partners has rocketed up the closely scrutinised league tables ranking deal activity on Wall Street and in Europe after advising on some of the biggest takeovers of the quarter. Centerview, which has advised on 18 deals totalling nearly $94bn so far this year, rose to third place from 14th place in the same quarter last year. The bank, which was launched in 2006 by investment bankers Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, has expertise in bank restructuring.   US regulators turned to Centerview following the run on deposits at Silicon Valley Bank to manage the sale of assets, including the investment bank. It also played a key role advising on the $3.25bn sale of Credit Suisse to UBS. Many large Wall Street banks were conflicted in the recent bank deals, creating an opening for independent advisers like Centerview.

"Peace on Earth postponed","US-China relations tested by Taiwan president’s visit, French protesters plan more action and UK strikes abound","This article is an on-site version of our The Week Ahead newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Sunday Hello and welcome to the working week. In different times the next few days would involve at least an element of calm with the customs and ceremonies for Easter and Passover. This year these events, for which financial markets around the world take a collective break, are coinciding with the three-day Qingming Festival (aka Tomb Sweeping Day) in China and Taiwan, and the Muslim festival of Ramadan. So is it peace on earth? Sadly not. Firstly, and most obviously, comes the indictment of former US president Donald Trump in New York on Tuesday. The news — both expected and sudden — has thrust the nation into a new era of division. The FT will have it covered. Click here for further background and analysis, including Joshua Chaffin’s excellent profile of the man presiding over the case, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.  Tensions between Washington and Beijing are also spiking again, this time over the ongoing tour of the Americas by Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen. It will reach a head on Wednesday when she meets US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California, which has been labelled “another provocation” by Beijing. It is also set to be another week of industrial unrest. The strikes in Britain this week range from driving examiners to dockyard workers. The news is likely to be both depressingly familiar and tinged with hope of settlements. On the one hand there will be more disruption and threats of further action. However, the government (or rather the chancellor Jeremy Hunt) has now found some money down the back of the Treasury sofa to help settle matters, at least in the public sector. Further details of specific walkouts below. In France, the unions are overseeing further protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reforms. This is likely to have much wider consequences for Europeans looking to get away by air for the upcoming Easter holiday weekend as French air traffic controllers join the walkouts — in addition to the disruption of ongoing strikes at Heathrow. Talking of which, I am taking some time off, not travelling far (thankfully), just shepherding our 16-year-old through the final push of GCSE exam revision — still mildly anxiety-inducing for all concerned. There will be no disruption to the Week Ahead service, however, as I am leaving that duty in the very capable hands of my colleague on FT Edit David Hindley.

Economic data It’s a short week for many financial markets, but there will be a steady flow of statistics, notably the Bank of Japan’s first-quarter Tankan manufacturing index, manufacturing and services purchasing managers’ index reports and, on Friday US labour data.  India and Australia’s central banks will consider interest rate changes, with the former expected to raise its Repo rate a further 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent and the latter likely to hold at 3.60 per cent. Companies We don’t usually highlight annual meetings on the Week Ahead lists, but then it’s not every week that you get one likely to be as heated as the gathering for Credit Suisse at the Hallenstadion in Zurich on Tuesday. Expect protests, not just among Credit Suisse shareholders but also Swiss nationals. There is a lot of public anger across the cantons about the failed bank’s rescue deal — listen to the inside story of how that all happened on the FT’s Behind the Money podcast — and opprobrium about the shortcomings of the board and management team that contributed to the company’s downfall. Then, a day later, UBS holds its AGM in Basel. Elsewhere, it’s thin gruel for earnings news, as you’d expect in the run-up to a long weekend holiday. We’re at the back-end of the results season, so it’s mainly trading updates and production reports.

"Global banks shed $459bn in market rout as Goldman Sachs loses on rate swing","Regulators discuss crisis with focus on Credit Suisse as March declines have mounted","Investors have wiped nearly half a trillion dollars from the value of bank shares around the world in the worst rout for the financial sector since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Financial stocks dived this week as the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank spread through global markets. Banks in the US, Europe and Japan have collectively lost $459bn in market value so far this month — the 16 per cent fall is the sharpest slump since March 2020. The heaviest losses came in the US, where the KBW Bank index has lost 18 per cent in March. Europe’s Stoxx 600 banks index has fallen 15 per cent, while Japan’s Topix banking sector index is down 9 per cent.  Efforts to stabilise the financial system and head off broader panic have been only partly successful. Shares in troubled Californian bank First Republic fell more than a quarter in afternoon trading on Friday despite a $30bn cash infusion from Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Credit Suisse shares fell 8 per cent even after Thursday’s provision of a SFr50bn ($54bn) emergency credit line from the Swiss central bank. The Zurich-based lender’s credit default swaps and bonds were trading at distressed levels. The volatile markets have hurt even banks that are seen as stronger, with some affected by the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling at its fastest pace since 1987. Goldman lost about $200mn at its trading desk that deals in interest rate products, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldman declined to comment. Global regulators held talks on Friday evening to discuss how to calm fears about the health of the financial system, with some focusing on options to stabilise Credit Suisse and its international subsidiaries. Executives and board members at the Swiss lender are also debating the future of the 167-year-old bank, which for years has lurched from one crisis to another. “Clearly we have to review the strategic plan,” said one person involved in emergency talks. “It has been a week of madness. We’re looking at everything possible that could be done. There is nothing that is taboo. But whatever happens the bank will survive.”  Another senior figure at the lender said they had to “reflect on the various contingency options that we have”. “We have a good strategy, but there is a question now whether market conditions and investor support will allow it the time to work.”  Options under consideration include breaking up the bank and raising funds via a public offering of its ringfenced Swiss division, with the wealth and asset management units being sold, the two people said. This would most likely be to rival UBS because the government and regulators would prefer them to stay under Swiss control. Adding pressure on management, one of the bank’s largest shareholders is now publicly calling for a separation of the domestic unit to protect depositors, mortgages and small businesses. “Drastic action is needed. There needs to be a full spin-off of the Swiss branch. We need to isolate that now because contagion is spreading to it,” said Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Ethos Foundation, which represents Swiss pension funds and institutions holding up to 5 per cent of the stock. Credit Suisse’s ringfenced domestic bank is worth as much as double the group’s entire market capitalisation, according to analyst estimates. “The SNB [Swiss National Bank] needs to step in,” Kaufmann added. “I had some calls from Swiss pension funds who are very worried about their exposure and they have been reducing it.”  Other proposals to be examined over the weekend include speeding up cuts at the investment bank, or even closing it entirely, the people added.

"How fast is the eurozone recovering from the impact of high gas prices?","Market Questions is the FT’s guide to the week ahead","How fast is the eurozone recovering from the impact of high gas prices? The recovery of the eurozone economy from last year’s energy price shock is expected to be confirmed this week with the release of gross domestic product figures showing a return to positive growth in the first quarter. A continued decline in energy prices — natural gas futures are down 45 per cent since the end of December — has given a boost to economic activity as worries about potential fuel shortages and a recession have receded. Economists polled by Reuters expect first-quarter GDP in the single currency bloc to rise 0.2 per cent from the previous quarter and 1.3 per cent from a year ago. That compares with zero growth in the fourth quarter.  Reinhard Cluse, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said: “The incoming hard data — in particular industrial production and construction — have clearly reinforced upside risk for the first quarter”.  Eurozone industrial production rose 1 per cent month-on-month in January and 1.5 per cent in February as an easing of supply bottlenecks lifted factory output, particularly at carmakers. Construction also rebounded with growth of 3.8 per cent in January and 2.3 per cent in February. One weak spot is retail spending, which fell 0.8 per cent in February, wiping out January’s gain. But trade provided “a significant boost” to eurozone GDP this year, according to Melanie Debono, an economist at research group Pantheon Macroeconomics. Exports were helped by China’s lifting of zero-Covid policies, while imports fell due to lower energy prices. The bloc’s trade deficit fell from over €13bn in December to almost zero in February. Martin Arnold Will US growth have slowed in the first quarter? The US economy is expected to have expanded in the first quarter but at a slower pace than the fourth quarter of last year, as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to tighten monetary policy takes its toll. Economists polled by Reuters have forecast that gross domestic product will have increased 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, down from an increase of 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Citi analysts argue that rising home sales will have bolstered the headline number for the first time since the end of 2021.  The slower growth comes as interest rates stand at their highest level in 15 years — in a range of 4.75-5 per cent. Higher interest rates crimp lending to businesses and individuals, slowing the economy along the way.  The first quarter also contained the banking turmoil following the collapse of two regional US lenders, SVB and Signature Bank. Though that is expected to have curtailed lending, particularly in commercial real estate, those effects may not be evident in first quarter data.  The Fed continues to argue that a “soft landing” of the economy is possible, and so it could lower inflation back to its 2 per cent target without pushing the country into recession. Market participants are less convinced and are pricing in interest rate cuts as soon as the end of this year, implying a recession to come in the second half. Kate Duguid Will the BoJ ease yield curve control? Markets are preparing for Kazuo Ueda’s inaugural policy meeting as governor of the Bank of Japan, at a time when multi-decade high inflation is making the BoJ’s ultra loose monetary stance harder to maintain. Investors had been speculating for weeks that the arrival of the 71-year-old academic, who took the helm on April 10, could spark the scrapping of the BoJ’s yield curve control, a policy which has been in place since 2016 to hold rates on the benchmark 10-year JGB at or around zero.  Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura think the BoJ will wait until June before it starts to curb yield curve control. Japanese inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices hit 3.8 per cent in March — its highest level since 1981 — but wage growth has been more subdued.  “It is unlikely that the Bank of Japan will change policy next week because it’s been saying it needs wage inflation to end yield curve control,” said Jordan Rochester, a foreign exchange strategist at Nomura.   In his first press conference Ueda said it was “appropriate to maintain the yield curve control for now” because of the current economic, price and financial conditions.” Instead, Ueda could use the meeting on Thursday and Friday to change the BoJ’s forward guidance for monetary policy away from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic towards the outlook for inflation, which could sow the seeds for tighter policy.   But traders do not rule out the possibility of the world’s third-largest economy taking the market by surprise next week, as it did in December when the target range for yield curve control was doubled to plus or minus 0.5 per cent.

"FCA launches insider dealing case against former Janus Henderson analyst","UK regulator says confidential information gleaned from role at fund manager enabled profitable trading","The UK’s financial regulator has launched criminal proceedings against a former analyst at fund manager Janus Henderson and four other people for conspiracy to commit insider dealing and money laundering. Redinel Korfuzi, 35, Oerta Korfuzi, 34, Iva Spahiu, 34, Rogerio de Aquino, 61, of Westminster, London and Dema Almeziad, 37, conspired to commit insider dealing offences between December 2019 and March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority alleged on Wednesday. The FCA claims that Redinel Korfuzi used confidential inside information gleaned from his job as an analyst at Janus Henderson to enable profitable trading in 49 companies through accounts held by his alleged co-conspirators.  The defendants used derivatives to bet that the value of shares in the companies would go down after announcements, generating profits of about £1.5mn, the FCA alleges. The five have also been charged with money laundering offences relating to more than 170 cash deposits totalling approximately £200,000. The defendants appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday. Each has indicated they will plead not guilty. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court for a plea and case management hearing on February 22. Janus Henderson confirmed that the allegations involved a former employee, adding: “The firm treats any actual or suspected misuse of confidential information with the greatest seriousness. Neither the firm, nor any employee of the firm, is the subject of these proceedings.” The FCA said that Janus Henderson has co-operated fully with its investigation. Money laundering is punishable by a fine or up to 14 years in prison. Since November 2021, insider trading has carried a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a fine. However, for offences committed before November 2021, insider trading carries a lower potential sentence of up to seven years in prison or a fine. The FCA, which regulates more than 50,000 businesses, and its predecessor the Financial Services Authority have secured 36 convictions in relation to insider dealing offences. Its most recent insider trading conviction was that of Fabiana Abdel-Malek, who worked at UBS, and Walid Choucair, who were both convicted of insider trading in 2019 at Southwark Crown Court in a colourful case that detailed confidential tips being passed on untraceable burner phones and meetings at exclusive members’ clubs.

"Brazil fourth-quarter GDP declines as economic challenges mount for Lula","Weak investment and slowdown in industry and services end five consecutive quarters of growth ","Brazil’s economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2022, underlining the challenges facing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as he aims to boost living standards and reduce poverty following a divisive election. Gross domestic product contracted by 0.2 per cent in the last three months of the year from the previous quarter, when it expanded 0.3 per cent, according to official data released on Thursday. The weak performance, driven by shrinking industrial output and a cooling of services sector activity, interrupted five consecutive quarters of growth.  Alexandre de Ázara, chief economist at UBS BB in São Paulo, said the deceleration reflected the lagged effect of monetary policy. The Central Bank of Brazil has undertaken aggressive tightening in an effort to contain inflation, raising its base interest rate from an all-time low of 2 per cent two years ago to 13.75 per cent in August.  “There was also an increase in post-election uncertainty that caused a slowdown in investment, which had been the engine of growth,” said de Ázara. Latin America’s largest economy grew by 2.9 per cent overall in 2022, buoyed by the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus measures, including fuel tax cuts and extra welfare payments, implemented under previous president Jair Bolsonaro in his failed re-election bid. However, it was a decrease from the growth rate of 5 per cent recorded in 2021 as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.  As high interest rates weigh on activity, the outlook is gloomier for Lula’s first year in office. Analysts predict annual economic expansion below 1 per cent for 2023.   “The slow pace of global growth may contribute to Brazil’s GDP remaining weak this year,” said Cristiane Quartaroli, economist at Banco Ourinvest. The slowdown will complicate Lula’s ability to deliver on his campaign pledges. The veteran leftwinger began a third presidential term in January after a narrow victory over the far-right populist Bolsonaro in a run-off vote.   Lula has promised to eradicate hunger and raise incomes with an increased minimum wage, social benefits and public works, but he faces strained public finances with little room for manoeuvre in the budget.  The 77-year-old former metalworker, who last ruled between 2003 and 2010, has lashed out at the central bank over its benchmark lending rate, the second-highest among G20 nations after neighbour Argentina.  Lula believes this is harming the wider economy and has questioned whether the institution should remain independent, sending jitters through the markets and leading investors to raise their inflation expectations.  Although Brazil’s headline consumer price index has fallen below double-digit rates, at 5.8 per cent inflation remains above the official target of 3.25 per cent. Investors are also anxiously awaiting the formulation of a new fiscal rule governing the public accounts.  During his election campaign Lula vowed to scrap a constitutional clause that pegs increases in state expenditure to the rate of inflation. It is considered by mainstream economists as key for keeping public spending in check and maintaining economic stability. “An interest-rate cut will only be possible if the government strengthens fiscal responsibility. While it remains unclear what rule will replace the spending cap, it will be very complicated,” said Camila Abdelmalack, chief economist at Veedha Investimentos.

"UniCredit seeks pay increase for Andrea Orcel to keep CEO happy","Italian bank head previously sued Santander over remuneration dispute","UniCredit is seeking to boost the pay of chief executive Andrea Orcel after he told colleagues he wants a bigger reward for turning round the Italian bank, according to people familiar with the matter.

Orcel was awarded €51.4mn in compensation in January this year after suing Santander for withdrawing a 2018 offer for him to become chief executive. The Spanish bank had second thoughts over the appointment because of Orcel’s pay demands to move from UBS.  Orcel’s total remuneration at UniCredit was €6.7mn last year, including a €4.8mn sign-on bonus, one of the highest packages in Europe and more than double that of his predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier.  But Orcel’s supporters say he should be paid more like Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase boss, who received $34.5mn last year. They point to UniCredit’s superior share price performance and the money from UBS that Orcel sacrificed after returning to the workforce following his departure from the Swiss bank. At UniCredit, Orcel’s pay expectations have involved the human resources team and external advisers who will be tasked with shareholder outreach, said one person close to the matter. The issue is “extremely sensitive”, the person said. Another person familiar with the matter said: “He knows how much he’s worth,” adding the CEO’s remuneration was “definitely an issue”. Under EU rules, Orcel’s bonus is capped at two times his fixed pay of €2.5mn. A third person familiar with the matter said: “Andrea always preferred a higher [bonus target] and higher carrot to be more aligned with shareholders.” Another person said Orcel would like to double his fixed pay to allow for a higher bonus if he met more stretching targets.  UniCredit has recently begun a round of shareholder meetings ahead of the annual general meeting in the spring. At the 2021 AGM, UniCredit only narrowly won investor support for his pay, with 42.7 per cent of them, including the single-largest investor BlackRock, voting against the group’s remuneration policy. However, the support grew in 2022 and some shareholders are in favour of boosting the chief executive’s pay, especially in light of the superior performance of the bank’s stock compared with peers. UniCredit shares are up more than 45 per cent since Orcel became chief executive last April, outperforming most European rivals. The bank’s hard-charging CEO has made returning €16bn of capital to shareholders by 2024 a key pillar of the new strategy he announced last December. It is on track to distribute €3.75bn via dividends and purchases of its own shares this year, raising alarm bells at the European Central Bank which has pushed for more caution. “At no point has Mr Orcel made any request to the board or remuneration committee with regard to increasing his compensation,” UniCredit chair Pietro Carlo Padoan told the Financial Times in a statement, adding that “remuneration for the CEO is entirely the remit of the RemCo which makes a recommendation to the board incorporating views of investors and wider stakeholders. CEO pay is reviewed every year, this has been the normal course of events for over a decade.”   Letters in response to this article:  A sense of entitlement is a meal best taken in private / From J Richard Finlay, Founder, The Finlay Centre for Corporate & Public Governance, Toronto, ON, Canada Being competitive doesn’t mean paying bankers more / From Jeremy James, Ashford, County Wicklow, Ireland","02.12.2022"
"First Republic could use a deal, too","Plus, regional bank lending matters a lot ","This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. Credit Suisse is well on its way to becoming a UBS subsidiary, and this is good news for markets. Our colleagues at Due Diligence have the blow-by-blow. Less good is the fact that, to clinch a deal, regulators ordered Credit Suisse to zero out some junior bondholders, even as shareholders get about 80 cents in UBS stock per share. What unintended consequences will follow? We will write about this in the days to come, and meanwhile email us your thoughts: robert.armstrong@ft.com & ethan.wu@ft.com. First Republic It was very good news for the banking system globally that Credit Suisse got bought. Across the Atlantic, investors might ask if the best outcome is for the same thing to happen to First Republic. The $30bn in deposits contributed by a consortium of large banks last week, and liquidity support from the Fed, did not reassure shareholders. The stock fell by a third Friday and then, in after-hours trading, by another 15 per cent. First Republic’s basic problem is analogous to Silicon Valley Bank’s, though not as severe. SVB’s large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, bought when rates were low, saddled the bank with mark-to-market losses. Combined with rising funding costs, the bonds were also dragging the bank’s profit margin towards zero. First Republic has a similar problem, but with a portfolio of mortgage loans rather than mortgage-backed bonds.   Here’s the math. As of year-end, First Republic had $17.5bn in shareholder equity. It had unrealised losses on its bond portfolio of $5.3bn — better than SVB, where unrealised bond losses were the equivalent of all its equity. Alas, First Republic also has $93bn in low-yielding fixed-rate mortgage loans. A mark-to-market writedown of those loans of a bit over 13 per cent, for instance, combined with the bond losses, would be enough to leave the bank without any equity.  The bank’s year-end financial statements show a carrying value for the entire real estate lending portfolio of $137bn, and a fair value of $19bn less.  It is perfectly possible, under normal circumstances, for a bank with little or no mark-to-market equity to not only function, but have a lot of value, so long as it remains profitable. That should be a key strength of First Republic, because of its strong wealth management business. The bank had a billion dollars in fee revenues last year. But wealth management is a reputation-sensitive business. The investors have to come up with an estimate of how many wealth management clients are going to stay with the bank.  Furthermore, depending on how many First Republic depositors have departed, some of those deposits will probably have been replaced by more expensive wholesale funding, adding to the pressure on the bank’s profits. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the bank has lost $70bn in deposits, or 40 per cent of the total, citing “people familiar with the matter”. Credit agency downgrades over the weekend won’t help with this. Here is S&P analyst Nicholas Wetzel, in his downgrade:  The $30 billion in deposits that First Republic reported it will receive from 11 large U.S. banks should ease immediate liquidity pressures . . . Nonetheless, we do not view this deposit infusion — which has an initial maturity of 120 days — as a longer-term solution to the bank’s funding issues. In addition, we think attracting meaningful deposits will be difficult, constraining the bank’s business position. First Republic tapped higher-cost secured funding extensively over the last week — likely, in our view, to fund deposit outflows. Anyone who buys the bank will have to assume the mark-to-market losses, complicating any sale. According to a Reuters report on Sunday: Some U.S. regional banks’ efforts to raise capital and allay fears about their health are running up against concerns from potential buyers and investors about looming losses in their assets, five sources with knowledge of the discussions said . . . The five sources, who work at or with major banks and private equity firms and examined such deals, told Reuters that they have decided not to participate for now for fear they could be hit with losses in the investment portfolios and loan books. What would make up for a lack of book equity is franchise value — the profit stream from the wealth management business, relationships with customers, brand value and so on. The hard question is what is left for shareholders. Here is Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini: We believe a sale of FRC to larger entity should be beneficial for the banking system as a whole, and should help ease contagion fears. However, given the fair value marks embedded in both its loan and securities portfolios, we find it difficult to come up with a realistic scenario where there’s residual value for FRC common equity holders . . . While the company has an exceptionally strong reputation and franchise value . . . we are doubtful that the valuation accorded to these factors would be enough to cover the tangible book value shortfall on a [fair value] basis. It will be interesting to see where First Republic’s stock opens this morning. More importantly for markets generally is how other bank shares fare. We would not be surprised if there were few signs of contagion. If there are other regional bank balance sheets that have problems like First Republic’s, we don’t know what they are. Even PacWest, a smaller bank that has seen its shares fall almost as much as First Republic’s, does not have mark-to-market losses of the same magnitude.  We continue to think, as we have said since the start of the trouble, that US regional banks as a group are well capitalised and liquid, and think contagion will be contained. A sale of First Republic would make us more confident still. Will the banking scare hurt growth? A lot of folks are suddenly worried about US regional bank lending. Over several decades regional banks have become a vital source of credit, especially in commercial real estate, where they make up the vast majority of lending. Alex Scaggs, whose excellent regional-banks primer will publish later today on Alphaville, shows this chart from Dario Perkins of TS Lombard. “Small” below means banks with less than $250bn in assets, which will tend to be regional:  Layered on top of that secular trend is a cyclical one: regional bank lending has greased the wheels of small business formation since the pandemic. As Joseph Wang has pointed out, 2022 marked a credit boom, spurred by strong wage growth and light household debt loads. Lenders big and small opened the taps. Lending by credit unions, a subset of small banks, exploded last year:  This helped sustain another boom in the small business sector, which accounts for almost half the jobs in the US. Job openings at firms with fewer than 10 employees are at an all-time high, note Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska at Jefferies. New businesses (which are usually small) are being formed like mad:  Of course, the flipside of small bank lending financing small business hiring is that inflation has roared. An important way contractionary monetary policy needs to work is by cutting off credit to small businesses, chiefly through regional lenders. This is happening. Starting in the third quarter of last year, the Fed’s senior loan officer survey showed banks getting much stricter about lending to small businesses:  The worry now is an overshoot — too much tightening of credit. Piling the effects of higher interest rates on top of liquidity stress among regional banks could lead to a vicious lending pullback, in effect a massive tightening of financial conditions. In a note published Friday, Adam Slater of Oxford Economics points out that banking crises — such as the US savings and loan crisis or the UK’s 1973 secondary banking crisis — reliably damage growth (while cutting inflation). He identifies four channels: payment system disruptions, lower output from financial services companies, negative wealth effects and tighter credit. Magnitudes vary but studies of past banking crises put the fall in GDP levels in the low-to-mid percentage point range.  But is this discussion premature? As Slater writes: The historical evidence also shows that policy responses matter. In an ideal world, the authorities would step in early to prevent problems at one or a few banks from causing broader financial (and real economy) contagion…So far, the signs are good with the Fed moving quickly to establish a new facility; the SNB stepping in to support Credit Suisse; and reassuring statements from the ECB. So, the most likely scenario is that central banks remain vigilant and provide liquidity to help the banking sector through this episode. That would mean a gradual easing of tensions as in the LDI pension episode in the UK late last year. For how fast and spectacular the banking panic has been, the scale of the underlying problem remains fuzzy. Central banks, fresh off stemming the market panic of 2020, are busting out the crisis toolkit again, including yesterday’s announcement of daily dollar liquidity lines. Betting they will fail seems a losing proposition. (Ethan Wu) One good read The $1mn bitcoin marketing exercise.

"Defence industry shares soar on western backing for Ukraine","Realisation that conflict is likely to drag on fuels 30 per cent rally since October","Shares in defence companies have surged in recent months, eclipsing gains for wider stock markets, as investors bet on the promises of increased military spending by western governments to help Ukraine’s war effort against Russia. An MSCI global benchmark for the sector is up almost 30 per cent in dollar terms since the start of October, 15 percentage points more than the broader gauge of worldwide equities. Europe’s Stoxx aerospace and defence index has risen just over a third over the same period.  The gains reflect a growing conviction among investors that the conflict is unlikely to end quickly. A rally ahead of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine last February had fizzled out in the early months of the war.  “In the autumn there was a realisation that the war would take longer, that more ammunition would be needed,” said Sven Weier, an analyst at Swiss bank UBS.  US group Raytheon rose 21 per cent from the start of January until mid-April 2022 but gave up those gains over the next five months. Its shares have since risen 23 per cent. After surging ahead of the invasion and into March, shares in the UK’s BAE Systems fell 5 per cent in the months to November but have since also risen by just over a quarter.  Following the rally in the final quarter, “we reckon that 2022 was the best year of defence stocks over the last 40 years”, said Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, in a note on the sector.   US president Joe Biden underlined his support for Ukraine this week with a surprise visit to Kyiv. “The defence of freedom is not the work of a day or a year,” he said. Defence contractors are now waiting for governments to follow through and place new orders. The biggest investors in European defence stocks with exposure to events in Ukraine are mostly US companies. Eight of Rheinmetall’s top 10 shareholders are based in the US, as are seven of Italian defence group Leonardo’s and eight of BAE’s.  European investors with a greater focus on environmental, social and governance issues were more lukewarm, Weier said. “Before the war, you could sense how people were disengaging because of ESG. Long-only European investors were saying defence was a non-starter. I do not sense that there has been a tremendous change there.” Some analysts said the defence sector’s strong performance over the past year was unlikely to be repeated, however. Stallard predicted that the coming 12 months would be a “tougher slog for the defence sector” given that “much of the good news is already baked into defence stocks”.  “If the broader global economic outlook becomes less bad” then investors may turn their attention to sectors better positioned to benefit from the upturn, he added. Byron Callan, managing director of research group Capital Alpha Partners, said he expected the sector to come up against headwinds this year, including continuing constraints on their ability to source enough skilled workers and raw materials.  Many companies have warned that supply chain problems are hampering efforts to increase production. In the US, a brewing battle over the national debt ceiling could undermine defence spending, added Callan. ","23.02.2023"
"FirstFT: Fed warns of credit crunch risk","Also in today’s newsletter, fund managers warn commercial real estate will be the ‘next shoe to drop’ and Erdoğan’s tough election challenge","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  The Federal Reserve has warned that the recent turmoil in the banking sector could lead to a credit crunch that risks slowing the US economy. In two separate publications released yesterday, the US central bank highlighted mounting concerns that the March collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as well as last week’s failure of First Republic, will lead to a pullback in lending by banks and a fall in asset prices. “A sharp contraction in the availability of credit would drive up the cost of funding for businesses and households, potentially resulting in a slowdown in economic activity,” the Fed said in its semi-annual financial stability report.   The Fed also released the results of its quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey yesterday, which found that banks expect to tighten lending standards in the rest of 2023. Fears that banks will reduce lending comes as the risk of a US default looms large over the economy. President Joe Biden will today host his political opponents in the White House in a push to settle the dispute over the US debt ceiling. The meeting follows a warning from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the US could breach the debt ceiling as soon as June 1, triggering an economic and financial catastrophe.  Biden administration officials have considered invoking the 14th amendment of the US Constitution to allow the government to continue issuing new debt to pay social security recipients, bondholders, government employees and others without legislative approval. But economists and constitutional experts are split over whether circumventing Congress in this way would be legal. The public is sharply divided over who to blame if the government defaults on its debt. A Washington Post/ABC poll published last week found that 39 per cent of respondents said they would mainly blame Republicans in Congress and 36 per cent said they would pin the blame on Biden. Sixteen per cent said they would blame both sides equally.  Who do you blame for the current debt stand-off?

"Artificial intelligence stocks soar on ChatGPT hype","Analysts warn of ‘speculative’ bubble as some shares more than double in value this year","Shares in small artificial intelligence groups have soared this year on the back of the hype surrounding ChatGPT and other generative AI models, leading analysts to warn of a “speculative” bubble in the making.  Last year marked a breakout year for AI that can produce fluent textual responses to questions, draft poems and stories and generate images on demand. Microsoft hopes to employ the technology used in OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot to overturn Google’s dominance of the internet search market. Alphabet hopes its own conversational AI service, Bard, will stop users from jumping ship. Big Tech’s embrace of generative AI has sparked frenzied interest among investors. BuzzFeed’s stock rose 150 per cent in a day in late January after chief executive Jonah Peretti said “AI inspired content” would begin appearing on the company’s website later this year.   Generative AI technology was showing “all the usual hallmarks of hype: social media echo chambers, exponential venture funding and a polarised media”, said analysts at Morgan Stanley. “During our travels around the US last week, ostensibly to discuss decarbonisation and reshoring, conversation regularly turned to ‘and what do you make of ChatGPT?’” US companies offering all manner of AI-related services are reaping the rewards.  Shares in SoundHound AI, which specialises in “speech to meaning” technology, have jumped 94 per cent so far this month. Shares in C3.ai and BigBear.ai have shot up 103 per cent and 561 per cent respectively since the start of the year, although both remain well below all-time highs hit during the stock market bull-run that began in 2020.    Such groups have quickly become popular with retail investors who have piled into equities recently as global economic forecasts have improved. Data provider VandaTrack this week said it expected a “continuation of speculative activity” in AI-related stocks as long as macroeconomic conditions remain favourable. ChatGPT in particular has caught the public’s attention, drawing around 100mn monthly active users in January after launching the previous month, according to UBS. “In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,” the bank said. “It took TikTok nine months after its global launch to add 100mn incremental users and it took Instagram 2.5 years.”  Even so, some investors burnt by last year’s sharp sell-off in once high-flying blockchain and Web3 stocks are wary of betting on the latest fad. Alphabet’s shares fell almost 8 per cent after Bard last week produced an ambiguous answer to a question about pictures taken by the James Webb Space Telescope.  Others worry what the technology might mean for jobs. “Replacing brains with a machine will do to middle-class jobs what replacing muscles with a machine did to working class jobs: lots will be destroyed and those left will have to be either very skilled or very unskilled,” said Rabobank.","11.02.2023"
"How default swaps become instruments of mass deception","Recent Deutsche drama shows that CDS are a bad barometer of whether a bank is in trouble ","Credit default swaps are a form of insurance against bond defaults. In this story, they feature as instruments of deception rather than “weapons of mass destruction”, the label once applied to all derivatives by Warren Buffett. You can speculate about whether investors were deceived by their own instincts or other factors. This does not change the story, or its takeaways. The price of Deutsche Bank CDS spiked during the afternoon of Thursday, March 23, and the following morning. Boaz Weinstein, founder of hedge fund Saba and a CDS expert who once worked for Deutsche, highlighted this in a tweet. “[I am] hearing it’s partly due to counterparty hedging,” he wrote, “but the move is really violent.” Other pundits piled on. They smelled blood. Deutsche has some common features with struggling Credit Suisse, which Swiss officials had jammed together with UBS days before. “Banking doom is back in Europe,” one tweeted. “Markets price 31 per cent default probability for DB subordinated bonds.”  Deutsche shares dropped more than 14 per cent. This generated big gains for short sellers. They had sold ahead about 3 per cent of Deutsche’s shares, according to filings. The FT’s Lex column, which is no fun at all in a market panic, wrote that Deutsche was not going bust. That weekend, German officialdom did not jam Deutsche together with Commerzbank or anyone else by way of a rescue. Deutsche shares clawed back their losses over the next few days. Confirmation bias is the human tendency to use new information to justify existing beliefs. Investors were already anxious about Deutsche. It is a famous, underperforming northern European bank, like Credit Suisse, though its period of risk-taking mismanagement was longer ago. Credit Suisse CDS had run up sharply before Swiss authorities stepped in. But CDS are bad barometers of whether a bank is in trouble. “This is a quirky little market,” says one trading boss. “It is illiquid and trade reporting is patchy.” In the US, new CDS transactions cover corporate bonds worth about $3bn daily at far lower cost than that figure. This compares with transactions worth almost $50bn in the underlying bonds. In addition, traders say as little as a quarter of CDS involve worried investors insuring against bond defaults. Banks, for example, often buy CDS on their own bonds to keep the risk exposure of their trading books within regulatory limits. It is straightforward enough to calculate a one in three risk of default from a steep five-year CDS price, as Twitter habitués did. But the sum has two fatal flaws. First, it includes an estimate of the amount debtors might recover if an issuer defaulted. But EU and German financial regulators would step in before Deutsche was in such dire straits. Second, the sum does not compensate for the illiquidity of a market where small deals exert heavy sway on prices.  Derivatives are geared instruments. But if CDS are rising by 25-30 per cent in a few hours and bond prices are only falling 3 cents on the euro in response to the same risk, it suggests the price relationship is a loose one. This was what happened to Deutsche.  Investors, in the guise of Chicken Little, seemed not to notice. An acorn, in the form of a CDS spike, had fallen on their heads. They were convinced the sky was falling.  Regulators suspect that someone — vulpine short sellers, presumably — dropped that acorn deliberately. Andrea Enria, top supervisor of the European Central Bank has called for a market review. It would not be a total surprise if this recommended central clearing and greater trade transparency for CDS. Regulators always want more of both these things.  A more aggressive regulatory response would be to ban anyone from buying bank CDS if they did not have some exposure to the underlying bonds. The EU imposed a curb on purchases of so-called naked CDS on sovereign bonds in 2011 in the wake of the great financial crisis. It could extend the ban to CDS on the bonds of global systemically important banks — the world’s top-tier lenders. I have a simpler solution: investors should try harder to distinguish between acorns and the sky falling on their heads. The characteristics of the CDS market mean the prices it generates are of anecdotal interest, rather than fundamental importance.  When panicking, stop, breathe, think. It works in physical emergencies. It should work in financial emergencies too.  jonathan.guthrie@ft.com ","03.04.2023"
"Oil price surges after Opec+ nations make surprise output cut","Saudi-led reduction of more than 1mn barrels per day puts Riyadh on collision course with US","Crude prices surged after Saudi Arabia and other members of the Opec+ group announced surprise oil production cuts of more than 1mn barrels a day on Sunday, putting Riyadh on a collision course with the US.  Oil prices leapt by 8 per cent when trading opened in Asia on Monday morning following news of the cut, with international benchmark Brent trading at over $86 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, rising to almost $81. Saudi Arabia will implement a “voluntary cut” of 500,000 b/d, or just under 5 per cent of its output, in “co-ordination with some other Opec and non-Opec countries”, it said on Sunday. The kingdom is attempting to boost prices amid fears of weaker demand.  Russia, a member of Opec+, said it would extend its existing 500,000 b/d production cut until the end of the year. Moscow’s reduction was first announced in March in retaliation for western countries’ moves to impose a price cap on its seaborne oil exports. The Saudi-led initiative is unusual as it has been announced outside a formal Opec+ meeting, suggesting an element of urgency by the members taking part in the cuts. The cuts follow a sharp fall in oil prices last month after the collapse of the US’s Silicon Valley Bank and the forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, which sparked fears of contagion in global financial markets and a significant drop-off in demand for crude.  “Opec+ have made a pre-emptive cut to get ahead of any possible demand weakness from the banking crisis that has emerged,” said Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects.  The surprise cuts risk reigniting disputes between Riyadh and the US, which last year pushed for the kingdom to pump more oil in a bid to tame rampant inflation amid a surge in energy costs. The White House in October accused Saudi Arabia of effectively siding with Russia, despite Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and its attempt to create an energy crisis by slashing gas supplies to Europe, when Opec+ last announced a formal production cut of 2mn b/d.   People familiar with Saudi Arabia’s thinking say Riyadh was irritated last week that the Biden administration publicly ruled out new crude purchases to replenish a strategic stockpile that had been drained last year as the White House battled to tame inflation. Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm’s statement that it could take “years” to refill the reserve sent oil prices briefly lower. The White House had previously offered reassurance to Saudi Arabia that it would step in to make purchases for its strategic reserve if prices fell. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty — and we’ve made that clear,” said a spokesperson for the National Security Council on Sunday. “[But] we will continue to work with all producers to ensure energy markets support economic growth and lower prices for American consumers.” Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said Saudi Arabia was staking out an economic strategy independent of the US, after a deterioration in relations between Riyadh and Washington during the Biden administration. “It’s a Saudi-first policy. They’re making new friends, as we saw with China,” Croft said, referring to a recent Beijing-brokered diplomatic deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The kingdom was sending a message to the US that “it’s no longer a unipolar world”.  The voluntary cuts from Opec+ members will begin in May and last until the end of 2023, the Saudi statement said. Iraq will reduce crude production by 211,000 b/d, the United Arab Emirates by 144,000 b/d, Kuwait by 128,000 b/d, Kazakhstan by 78,000 b/d, Algeria by 48,000 b/d and Oman by 40,000 b/d, according to statements from their respective governments.   Brent, the crude benchmark, fell to a low near $70 a barrel late last month but had stabilised in the past week to recover to just below $80. Brent has traded in a relatively narrow band between $75 and $90 a barrel for much of the past six months. Despite last month’s sell-off many traders were predicting higher prices later this year when supplies are expected to fall short of demand as China’s economy fully reopens from its Covid-related restrictions. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the half- brother of prime minister and crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, has argued the world is underinvesting in oil supplies. The kingdom is reliant on oil revenues to fund the Prince Mohammed’s ambitious economic reform programme.

"Wry humour, grief and Bear Grylls all on show at Credit Suisse conference","‘Embracing Reality’ is the prescient theme of stricken bank’s Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong","As Credit Suisse entered weekend crisis talks that would end in its forced takeover, a group of its bankers embarked on a different sort of survival challenge: an outdoor adventure trip that they were filming for Bear Grylls. The executives spent Friday night on a camping retreat in Sai Kung, a picturesque district of Hong Kong known for its hiking trails, said three people with knowledge of the matter.  Grylls, the TV adventurer, will use their filmed material in a presentation he is giving at Credit Suisse’s flagship investor conference in the city this week. The subject of his talk is “lessons learned from navigating some of the harshest environments”. The staff paid for the trip themselves, Credit Suisse said.   It is just one element of the bank’s Asian Investment Conference that is unintentionally prescient: this year’s theme is “Embracing Reality”. Months in the making, the gathering began in Hong Kong on Tuesday just two days after a forced takeover by rival UBS at the behest of regulators that ended its 167-year independent history.  “We must all continue to work as normal,” Credit Suisse’s chief executive Ulrich Körner and chair Axel Lehmann wrote in a memo to staff on Monday, the day after the sale. About 1,600 executives from asset managers, hedge funds, family offices and other investment groups arrived at Hong Kong’s five-star Conrad hotel to watch shell-shocked Credit Suisse executives attempt to follow that instruction.  The conference has been a fixture of the region’s financial calendar for more than a quarter of a century. This time around, the agenda included weighty topics such as US-China relations, the chip war and Russia’s war in Ukraine. After the weekend’s events, some of the financial panels — “Where has all the risk gone?” and “In a fast-changing, fragmented world, how can we create sustainable value?” — sounded out of place.  Still, on the event’s main stage, “it felt like business as usual”, said Mark Kwan, an executive director of the Singapore wealth manager Straits Asset Management. “If you didn’t read the news, you wouldn’t have thought anything had happened. Maybe it hasn’t sunk in yet.” Neil Hosie, head of global equities at Credit Suisse, speaks at the bank’s investment conference in Hong Kong  Wry humour peppered private conversations. That included jokes about whether attendees needed to pay for their own breakfast or whether the Swiss National Bank would pay, and whether bankers’ corporate credit cards were still working, according to one attendee.   Two people said, half in jest, that they were hoping to pick up merchandise that would mark the end of an era. Lehman Brothers-branded baseball caps sell for hundreds of dollars on eBay. A third said none was available, “not even any pens”.  There were some exceptions to the business-as-usual rule. Körner, Lehmann and Hong Kong’s chief executive John Lee cancelled plans to attend, in what a bank spokesperson described as minor changes to the schedule.  Journalists had their invitations rescinded at the eleventh hour. Several turned up anyway, though they were closely supervised by communications staff and kept out of the main event. “The AIC represents Credit Suisse at its best,” Neil Hosie, the bank’s global head of equities, said in a statement. “For 26 years, it has been our privilege to present powerful perspectives on the themes that matter most.” Hosie took Körner’s slot at the event.  Beneath the humour and sense of the absurd, there was sadness. In private conversations, clients offered to help Credit Suisse bankers find new jobs, according to a banker present. A reporter gave a Credit Suisse media relations executive — who was tasked with keeping the press out — a reassuring pat on the shoulder.  Several attendees said they felt they were intruding on private grief. One called it a “sad and nostalgic time”.   A Credit Suisse banker said they were disturbed by a reporter while they were trying to have a “sentimental conversation” with colleagues.  Credit Suisse staff “are absolutely gutted and shell-shocked”, said an adviser who held meetings with its bankers on the day of the event. “There’s a lot of upset and anger.”  “Things weren’t easy there,” said a former Credit Suisse banker as he reflected on the takeover on the eve of the conference. “But my God, I never expected it to end like this.” Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"FirstFT: US debt ceiling impasse pushes price of insuring against default to 11-year high","Also in today’s newsletter, FBI arrests junior military employee over leaks and Intel seeks to regain chips leadership","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  A political stalemate in Washington over raising the US debt ceiling has pushed the cost of buying insurance against a government default to its highest level in more than a decade, an early sign of market worries about the impasse. The price of five-year credit default swaps — the most widely traded form of debt insurance — reached its highest since 2012 this month, although at 46 basis points, it remains well below levels during the 2008-09 financial crisis. The new Republican leadership of the US House of Representatives is demanding deep budget cuts in exchange for raising the federal borrowing limit, but the White House has said it will not negotiate.  In 2011, a stand-off over the debt ceiling led to the US losing its top-notch triple A credit rating. While a default on US federal debt is still viewed as unlikely, investors are moving to protect against, or profit from, the possibility. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has warned that a default, which could theoretically come as early as June, would lead to “catastrophe”.

"Hedge funds caught off guard again in turmoil","Sharp moves after the implosion of SVB have left many in the red for the year","Hedge funds have hardly been covering themselves in glory during a tumultuous few weeks for markets. Sharp moves in the US government bond market and in bank stocks, driven by failures in the US regional banking sector and the fall of Credit Suisse, have left numerous funds in the red for the year. Many managers were found to be sitting in trades that seemed obvious at the time based on the perfectly rational belief that interest rates had to move higher to combat stubbornly high inflation. Unfortunately, this also meant that these trades became crowded, and therefore dangerous if funds all rushed to the door to reverse them.  Most painful were the bets run by macro and computer-driven funds against government bonds. A number of managers had made a fortune last year latching on to the huge sell-off in bonds and saw little reason to change their view. But when the collapse of SVB sent investors rushing into the safe haven of government debt and sent the US two-year Treasury yield tumbling at its fastest pace since 1987, funds suddenly found themselves in exactly the wrong position — betting against an asset that investors desperately wanted. Managers racing to unwind their bets only exacerbated the price move. One of the funds hit hard has been Said Haidar’s Haidar Capital, a standout performer last year when its bond bets helped it make nearly 200 per cent. But it lost 32 per cent from the start of March to the middle of the month, according to people familiar with the data. One of these people said this took losses this year to 44 per cent. And Chris Rokos’s Rokos Capital, which made more than 50 per cent last year, was also caught out, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission raising concerns after the fund faced margin calls — though counterparties contacted by the FT said they were not concerned about its ability to meet such calls. Computer-driven hedge funds were also hit. Many that try to profit from following market trends were running short positions in bonds prior to the turmoil and had to quickly cut them. Man Group’s AHL Evolution fund lost 11.3 per cent in March to the 28th of the month, while Progressive Capital Partner’s Tulip Trend dropped 26.3 per cent in March to the 24th. London-based Aspect Capital slashed its bets on bonds from nearly half of its Diversified fund’s budget for risk in bonds in early March to less than 8 per cent by the end of last week, according to investor documents seen by the Financial Times.  Meanwhile, many funds were also hurt by their bets on bank stocks. In a rising rate environment, owning banks — which would benefit from higher net interest income — seems like a logical move. Hedge funds’ exposure to the sector duly reached a 12-month high in early February, according to a Morgan Stanley client note, while they ran bets against other parts of the market likely to be hit by higher borrowing costs. That left them badly positioned for the ensuing banking sector shakeout.  Hedge funds were “not bearish the right things” in Europe, said Bernard Ahkong, co-chief investment officer at UBS hedge fund unit O’Connor. It was “a higher interest rate playbook”. Not every manager was on the wrong side of these moves. Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay, had closed his bet against government bonds prior to the turmoil and was then able to put on a short bet following the rally. Roy Niederhoffer’s Macro Diversified fund is up 10.3 per cent in March after benefiting from the market volatility and latching on to the bond rally. Nevertheless, hedge funds on average have now lost 1.7 per cent in March and are down 0.6 per cent this year up until March 28, according to data group HFR. Not a great look when the S&P 500 equity index was up about 3.4 per cent over the same period. It marks yet another disappointing episode for the hedge fund industry. After a decade of becalmed markets dominated by central bank stimulus, higher interest rates were meant to usher in a new, more favourable era for managers. Their ability to distinguish winning stocks from losing stocks and to predict major macro trends would supposedly once again pay off.  But the transition to higher rates has also meant a series of landmines and violent market moves that have caught many funds off guard, as discovered by managers holding overpriced technology stocks early last year. Trading conditions may slowly be turning more favourable, but there are likely to be plenty of dangers ahead too. laurence.fletcher@ft.com","04.04.2023"
"How ‘competitive’ would you like your bank regulation now? ","Unravelling of Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank gives whip hand to those in favour of tough oversight ","The UK regulatory pendulum has been halted in mid-swing. The direction of travel for bank regulation in recent years has clearly been in the financial services sector’s favour. Aided by a government eager to find benefits of post-Brexit regulatory freedom, there has been a sense of opportunity to tweak or modify, to strip off gold-plating or at least remove some of the shine.  This was epitomised by the return of “international competitiveness” as an objective for watchdogs, a concern that was struck from the regulatory remit after the last financial crisis. The comeback was limited to secondary status behind priorities such as consumer protection and safeguarding the system. But it reflected some loosening of the regulatory vice around the banking sector after the global financial crisis.   Not any more. The mayhem that started with Silicon Valley Bank in the US and resulted in this weekend’s forced sale of 167-year-old Credit Suisse to arch-rival UBS will put a stop to that shift. In good times, the idea of “competitiveness” of banking regulation is used to carp about domestic strictures hurting the industry compared with other markets. In bad times, that turns on a dime: a competitive banking jurisdiction is the one where institutions are left unsullied or still standing. Banks fail for a variety of reasons but are universally awful to deal with when they do. The interest rate shock that did for Silicon Valley Bank was compounded by the Trump-era loosening of regulations on banks with under $250bn in assets — a “huge error” in the words of one regulatory expert. The UK’s promised regime for smaller lenders, known as Strong and Simple, only includes domestically-focused banks with up to £20bn in assets. Still, the idea that small to midsized banks should get an easier ride is likely to meet renewed resistance. Credit Suisse, on the other hand, managed to scandalise itself out of existence, to die from embarrassment. It had lurched from one humiliating crisis to another, be it Greensill Capital, Archegos, “tuna bonds” or being forced to delay its results following a call from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In an environment where the market was looking to attack banking’s weakest link, its investors and customers just lost faith in the bank — operationally, culturally and managerially.  The bank had plenty of capital and liquidity, on current regulatory demands. But those who have long argued that banks by their very nature need much higher capital requirements still, like chair of the post-crisis Independent Commission on Banking John Vickers, may feel vindicated. Tools that give regulators leverage over banks’ internal processes and management, such as the UK’s senior managers and certification regime which is under review as part of the government’s Edinburgh reforms, won’t be given up or watered down without a fight. Reforms that rely on the idea that post-crisis adjustment has made big bank failures manageable feel rather doomed. No matter how much work has been done on bank resolution, when push comes to shove regulators and politicians have balked at the prospect.  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here Critics of the UK’s ringfencing regime, which legally separated domestic consumer deposits from riskier investment banking activities, have argued that progress on resolution had rendered it unnecessary (as well as that it created less diversified entities that are less resilient). The first looks at best unproven. And the second must overcome the idea that ringfencing still gives regulators and politicians more options when things go wrong. “You don’t have to be a big fan of ringfencing to recognise that it gives you rather more control over what happens in a crisis,” says one former regulator.   Ultimately, the power has shifted back towards regulators like the Prudential Regulation Authority, which last year was overruled on crucial insurance rules by a government wanting to plant its Brexit dividend flag. That will help it see off wailing about its by-the-book proposals for implementing Basel IV rules, as well as giving ample scope to move slowly on other reforms should it choose. Of course, rules can be tweaked and oversight made more effective without compromising high standards. But those who argue that robust and unyielding regulation is, through the cycle, a competitive advantage in banking now have the whip hand over detractors.  helen.thomas@ft.com@helentbiz","20.03.2023"
"Tanks: Rheinmetall will gain as German leopard changes its spots ","A technology dating from 1916 remains a sweet spot for defence group","Germany is yielding to pressure to permit the use of its Leopard tanks by Ukrainian forces. This should prove advantageous to Rheinmetall too. Germany’s main defence contractor could offload its stock of the weapons, refurbish those of clients, and sell valuable ammunition by the tank load.  Tanks epitomise new demand for old weapons following the grim revival of conventional warfare in Europe. A technology dating from 1916 remains a sweet spot for the likes of Rheinmetall and collaborator KMW, a private Franco-German group. Leopards have more going for them than the ironclads of the western front. They can reputedly hit targets 6km away, outgunning rival Russian T-90s, while depending on relatively plentiful ammunition and fuel types.   Many European nations have Leopard 2 tanks they could release. Rheinmetall has 139 tanks in its sights: 22 in its warehouse, 29 it is building for other customers and 88 older Leopard 1 tanks it might acquire.  A step-up in the tank trade could net Rheinmetall a tidy sum. Depending on its condition, a used Leopard 2 might fetch an additional €5mn-€10mn, implying a sale worth €100mn-€200mn for Rheinmetall’s 22 vehicles. The 88 Leopard 1 tanks might bring in the same again. Assuming a higher-than-average margin of 15 per cent, the lot might add some €30mn-€60mn to ebit. That compares with 2023 group ebit of €958mn, according to UBS forecasts.  Rheinmetall could also profit from refurbishing Leopards. But the real prize would be supply contracts for spare parts and ammunition. These typically fetch twice the revenues of the original sale, according to Alexander Wahl at Stifel. Each round of ammunition might cost €6,000-€7,000. Tanks carry 40-plus rounds. If every tank fired 20 rounds a day, monthly ebit would be around €1mn per vehicle, applying a 25 per cent margin. By this reckoning, a battalion of 100 Leopards would produce ebit of €100mn a month for suppliers. The cost would also be quantified in gruesome deaths and bereaved families. But plentiful finance and superior engineering determines conventional conflicts alongside casualties. Already, the cost of restocking Europe’s armed forces with 120mm shells could be €6.3bn, according to Sash Tusa at Agency Partners.  Rheinmetall will be joining Ukraine and much of Europe’s leadership in congratulating wary Germany for changing its spots and uncaging the Leopards.

"Get ready for the great unwinding","Darwinian pressures will change the finance sector","The writer is a financial journalist and author of ‘More: The 10,000-Year Rise of the World Economy’ The recent turmoil in financial markets is a sign of a longer term problem. More than a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation has proved to be far from transitory. That has meant government bond yields, while volatile, have shown no sign of dropping back to the historic lows reached in the past decade.  The knock-on effects have been seen in the past few weeks’ banking sector turmoil after losses on long-term bonds triggered the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The loss of confidence in the sector spread, leading to the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS and an emergency funding deal for First Republic. It seems as if the great speculative era has ended, and a new phase, the great unwinding, has begun.  Finance is a Darwinian world in which participants must adapt their strategies to survive. In the great speculative era, the cost of finance was generally low or falling, and the price of assets was generally rising. A strategy of borrowing money to buy assets was the best way to prosper; hardly surprising that investment vehicles such as private equity did so well. By the same token, high nominal returns meant that clients were relaxed about paying hedge-fund fees and venture capital groups could also flourish. It is true that this era was subject to the occasional cull such as the collapse of the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s and the financial crisis of 2007-08. But the speculative bug came back with a vengeance in the 2010s. Risk-taking just found new avenues to explore; cryptocurrencies and special purpose acquisition vehicles, the listed shell companies that raise funds and seek something to buy, are just a couple of examples. But all that will change if the great unwinding takes hold. Interest rates and bond yields will trend higher not lower. Just as low bond yields resulted in an upwards repricing of risky assets, higher yields will cause a shift in the opposite direction. Borrowing to buy assets will be an extremely dangerous bet. There was a massive example of a great unwinding between 1965 and late 1981 when the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds surged from 4.2 per cent to 15.8 per cent. The effect on risky assets was grim. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to break above 1,000 in 1972, but was still trading at near that level in 1981. It is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that the next unwinding will be as long-lasting as that era. But possible calamities include the breakdown of globalisation as relations between the US and China become increasingly hostile, a slowdown in growth as the global economy struggles to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and political division in the US. Even if those risks are avoided, we have seen signs of how a shift to the new era would be difficult for the financial sector. SVB had its own peculiarities, particularly its bet on long-dated bonds and its dependence on wholesale deposits. Credit Suisse, with its long history of scandal, was a particularly weak link among European banks. And it is hardly surprising that there has already been trouble among institutions exposed to cryptocurrencies, a sector that has seen more collapses than the towers in a game of Jenga.  Higher bond yields also will cause crises in many other places. In the autumn, British pension funds were caught out by their use of liability driven investment, an approach that on the surface sounded risk-averse but which in practice turned out to involve leveraged bets on the bond market. Longer term, the Darwinian forces as well as regulatory pressures will force institutions and investors to adapt to the great unwinding.  The world may even return to the days when a reputation for prudence was regarded as a commercial asset. If that does happen, then the numbers of bankers and fund managers who receive multimillion dollar bonuses will reduce. If risk-taking is seen as a vice, rather than a virtue, behaviour will have to change.  Just as the authorities had to rescue a bank based in the libertarian enclave of Silicon Valley, many in the finance sector are now counting on the central banks to change the direction of  monetary policy and allow the speculative era to have one last hurrah. It all depends on whether the US Federal Reserve perceives the need to avoid a financial crisis as greater than the need to bring inflation back down to target. In short, will Fed chair Jay Powell prove as steely an inflation fighter as his predecessor Paul Volcker? . ","11.04.2023"
"Who killed Credit Suisse?","The legality of liquidity versus solvency","Jerôme Legras is a managing partner and head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments Corporate finance used to be simple. In a bankruptcy, bondholders would get their money first, then subordinated bondholders, and eventually shareholders. But the 2008 crisis happened, and a lot of old-style corporate finance was thrown out of the window. The 2010 G20 summit in Washington created a new world order for bank failures, based on a few key principles: Avoid the use of taxpayer moneyImplement far-reaching crisis resolution tools to avoid contagionIn any case, treat all investors fairly and maintain the “no creditor worse off” principle, ie, no one should be worse off in a crisis resolution than in a bankruptcy This was all very nice, but quickly clashed with realpolitik. The no-creditor-worse-off principle, designed to protect investors, turned into a license to kill. An estimate that bankruptcy would give zero recovery was enough for regulators to be allowed to do anything. The goal-seek approach to resolution is how we ended up with the Portuguese authorities bailing in senior bonds based on their ISIN codes starting in XS instead of PT.  Another reason for this is that “bank failure” is now a fuzzy and moving legal concept, with multiple legal routes available to justify bondholder losses. Voluntary liquidation, bankruptcy, precautionary recapitalisation, resolution, restructuring, burden sharing, point of non-viability . . . they all mean the same thing: a bank is failing, something must be done, and for the greater good someone must lose money. Let us set aside legal geekery for now, and focus on the fact that the common-sense legal hierarchy was set aside. AT1 bondholders were wiped out while shareholders got Sfr3bn. Is this fair? Is this legal? Is this right? It is difficult to answer this without simply confirming your priors. Investors not owning the bonds will gleefully state that “it’s what they were created for, just read the docs!”, whereas bondholders will explain how unfair this has been and how Switzerland has turned into a banana republic. I will do my best to objectively explain what I think really happened and the issues this raises. Yes, AT1 bonds were created to absorb losses. That is fair and no investor will deny it. AT1 holders should not expect to be bailed out. But while Credit Suisse had a very long list of problems, where are the losses? UBS itself said they would recognize Sfr61bn of badwill and no one made any mention of any loss. Maybe litigations will cost more than what they have been provisioned for? But the smartest litigation analyst I know, Elliot Stein, estimates around Sfr1.2bn of extra costs. Even tripling that number would not significantly impair CS’s equity. The truth is that no one, and especially not the supervisor, suggested that Credit Suisse was facing losses that needed to be “absorbed”. We all know this was a liquidity crisis triggered by the most expensive couple of words in financial history: “absolutely not”. 

 Another headache comes from the decision to subordinate AT1 holders versus shareholders. Again, we should differentiate legalities and market expectations. Those were very clear: like it or not, when the FT broke the story that UBS planned to offer more than zero for CS equity, everyone believed AT1 bonds would be left untouched and prices soared.  Maybe AT1 investors are dumb, and they should be aware that they are junior to shareholders. But apparently, the ECB, the EBA, the SRB and the BOE disagree. They have all come up with a statement on Monday confirming that AT1 holders should expect to be senior to shareholders; In particular, common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would Additional Tier 1 be required to be written down. This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions. Marketing docs did add clarity to market expectations: I mean, who does not understand immediately who is senior and who is junior on this beautiful chart? © Credit Suisse But let us assume that marketing leaflets are not relevant and what matters is only the law and the documentation, which, unless you are a retail holder, is probably true.  What did the law say? Relevant Swiss legislations include the Banking Insolvency Ordinance and the Swiss Banking act. Both deal with bank bankruptcies and restructuring measures, and neither gives the impression that AT1 is junior to equity. For example, Article 30.b.5, dealing with recapitalisation measures within a restructuring, provides that debt can be written down only if equity is entirely wiped out.   The insolvency ordinance, which also deals with restructuring in Chapter 3, includes Article 47 and 48:   Note that Article 48.c explicitly says that Cocos or AT1 are debt instruments:  “Ah, but this is about conversion,” I hear you object. “AT1 were wiped out, not converted.” That’s where Article 50 comes to the rescue:  I am not a lawyer. There might be highly subtle legal loopholes. Nevertheless, there is more than enough here for the market to understand that a reduction in claims in AT1 bonds comes after wiping out shareholders —mostly because it is what is written. Blame AT1 holders for not looking for loopholes, maybe, but not for having the wrong expectations; and wrongfooting market expectations is a risky business.  But wait, there is ANOTHER possibility. What if Credit Suisse was not in a restructuring, not in a resolution, not in anything. What if all those articles were moot? Indeed, there are two words missing in the FINMA release: “resolution” and “restructuring”. If none of those articles apply, we would only have the contracts to rely on. Could it be that the prospectus was sufficient to trigger the write-down of the bonds? As the FT’s Robert Smith pointed out, there is indeed a provision in the risk factors that would suggest an inversion of the hierarchy is possible. Obviously, the fact that it comes three lines after a sentence that states the exact opposite does not make it any clearer, but at least it was in there, somehow:   Still, risk factors are not clauses, and this might not be what we are looking for: if there was no restructuring, a risk factor about restructuring is not hugely relevant. What matters more is the article on “write-down”, which if applied is the contractual basis for wiping out bondholders. It can be found in almost identical terms in all AT1 prospectuses. Write-downs can be triggered by a “Contingency event” or a “Viability event”.  Contingency events are easily dealt with: the CET1 ratio of CS did not change during the weekend and this was not triggered.  Viability events are trickier. Again, there are two branches. The first one is this:  Not an easy one to trigger: FINMA confirmed on Wednesday that CS was solvent and SNB gave it Sfr50bn of liquidity; no measure to improve capital seems to have been envisaged and Tier 2 instruments were not converted. Maybe this changed in two days, but it is not the easiest thing to prove. The second one is the one that is most often quoted as being the reason for the non-viability event:  But does it really hold? Nothing the government did improved CS’s capital adequacy — especially not a second loss guarantee on litigations that are not in the balance sheet. Again, not an easy thing to prove — which by no way means it cannot be argued in court. If the prospectus language is not strong enough to explain the wipeout, then what is? Looking carefully at the FINMA statement we get a hint of what I think happened.  If you are a supervisor, about to wipe out Sfr16bn of securities based on a complex interpretation of a prospectus and likely to face hundreds of lawsuits, why would you kill your strongest argument and say that Credit Suisse is solvent?! The reason is probably very simple: because the prospectus is not your legal basis for wiping out the bonds. And this is where we go back to the initial question: how did the Swiss do this, was it legal, could it be expected and was it fair? On March 16, after the statement of support for Credit Suisse was issued and the new liquidity line was decided, the Swiss passed a new law about emergency liquidity funding for systemic banks. This included two key elements: Article 4.c requires that the bank is solvent . . .   (Ah! Maybe the reason for that FINMA statement is clearer now!) And . . . Article 6 follows Article 5:  This may sound trivial, but suddenly, on Sunday evening, a new Article 5.a. appeared:  If your German is as rusty as mine, maybe your French is better?  In plain English, any such emergency liquidity can lead to a full write down of AT1 bonds. And this is where we finally find the legal basis of the write-down. Not the Swiss resolution regime, not the bond documentation, but a law that was passed immediately before, just to allow it. A law is legal, usually, unless a constitutional court or an international court disagrees, but bond investors are generally not too keen on emergency laws designed to wipe them out. At the end of this long exploration into AT1 shenanigans, I would like to stress that the most important lesson here might not be about AT1s!  For what appears to be the first time, a central bank facility has extremely harsh conditions attached. In our world of social media and digital banking, any measure that reduces the effectiveness of central bank liquidity is unlikely to set a global standard. Walter Bagehot must be turning in his grave.","21.03.2023"
"FirstFT: Janet Yellen’s olive branch to China","Also in today’s newsletter, Credit Suisse bondholders sue Swiss regulator and Tesla raises Model S and X prices ","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  Janet Yellen yesterday warned that any effort to decouple the economies of the US and China would be “disastrous” for both countries and destabilising for the world. In a major speech that called for a “constructive and fair” economic relationship between Washington and Beijing, Yellen said “we can find a way forward if China is also willing to play its part.” Relations between the two powers have reached their worst state in decades after efforts to ease tensions were derailed two months ago when a suspected Chinese spy balloon flew over the US.  Beijing maintains that Washington is trying to contain its rise by limiting its ability to develop a high-end semiconductor industry. Addressing that point, Yellen made clear that whenever US national security collided with economics, the former would always take priority. “The US will assert ourselves when our vital interests are at stake,” she said. But in an interview with the Financial Times before the speech, the treasury secretary sounded more emollient and made clear she wanted to visit China as soon as Xi Jinping had appointed her counterparts to their jobs. “I see myself as carrying on the agenda that Biden and Xi established at the G20 meeting in Bali [last November],” she said. “I was at that meeting. They were both very clear with one another that they wanted to have a productive economic relationship. There was a clear understanding that economic relations are not a zero-sum game and that we need to step up our interaction.” More news on China: Beijing is building sophisticated cyber weapons to “seize control” of enemy satellites, according to a leaked US intelligence report.

"The latest bank failures show the dangers of aiming too high","Both Credit Suisse and SVB fell victim to familiar pitfalls for ambitious lenders","The writer is the author of several books on the City and Wall Street To have one banking crisis might be regarded as misfortune, to have a second within 15 years looks distinctly careless. It may not be over yet, but already some lessons for the authorities and investors are emerging from the latest mishap.   The most obvious is that the bank run has changed, making banking, never an easy industry to manage, even harder. Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank and others were brought down by rapid, technology-enabled withdrawals of deposits, set off by falling share prices. News spread through social media, triggering a further fall in share prices and yet more withdrawals. Anxious customers no longer need to queue at the branch to get their cash, they simply press a button. The Victorian business model of joint-stock banks offering instant-access deposits and fixed-term loans needs proactive regulation and conservative management if it is to survive in the modern age.   There has been mixed evidence of the former. Capital, liquidity and leverage controls put in place after the 2008 global financial crisis helped and once the dam broke, central banks and regulators took decisive action. The brutal defenestration of Credit Suisse by the Swiss authorities, the seizure in effect of SVB by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the British regulator-managed sale of its UK subsidiary for £1 was effective crisis management. But the US authorities in particular have questions to answer about how the situation was allowed to develop. SVB’s rapid growth, its unhealthy concentration of both assets and liabilities and other risk-management issues led the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to issue several warnings to the bank’s management and a ban on acquisitions. The regulator had spotted the danger signals as far back as 2021 but not enough was done to act on them. The US Federal Reserve’s board, to which the regional Feds report, has ordered a fast-paced review and the answers will be of interest to regulators everywhere.  This includes Britain where the government’s intention appears to be to loosen bank regulation. Giving regulators a secondary mandate of facilitating growth and international competitiveness looks more dangerous by the day as the crisis plays out.  So too does a planned review of the UK’s rigorous regime by which senior managers are held to account. Shareholders and bondholders risk being wiped out by bank failures and are entitled to know that those responsible will indeed be held responsible. Going easy on management looks like bad regulation since the primary cause of the failure of both Credit Suisse and SVB was management failure. At Credit Suisse, a venerable Swiss institution schooled in credit-based balance sheet lending, the fundamental error was strategic and goes back a long way. It wanted to be a full-service universal bank, a big ask for anything other than an American institution, and it bought the Wall Street bulge bracket bank First Boston in stages between 1978 and 1996.  This set up a cultural mismatch between conservative Swiss bankers and go-getting Wall Streeters. There were periods of success but there were also plenty of danger signs, including a revolving door of American heavy hitters and regular fines, losses and scandals.  A $5.5bn trading loss in 2021 when its prime broking client Archegos Capital collapsed was a blow too many. In 2022 plans were announced to spin off a greatly downsized investment bank, reversing a strategy whose bequest was simply to leave the whole group vulnerable.  None of the European banks has ever looked comfortable owning and operating a full-scale investment bank including, incidentally, Credit Suisse’s rescuer UBS. Credit Suisse’s attempt wasn’t the worst but it was an ambitious strategy that became harder as the industry evolved. The saga shows that aligning strategy with managerial resources is the most important decision that a bank’s board has to take and probably the most difficult. SVB had a simpler strategy but fell victim to another pitfall for ambitious banks: groupthink. Banker of choice to tech start-ups, it over-concentrated deposits from customers in fixed-interest securities. When interest rates rose and bond prices sank, it was ruined. Where was the challenge from the board? It was a rerun of 2007-2008 when the banks followed each other into subprime mortgages, few thinking to challenge conventional wisdom.  This is the clearest lesson to emerge from this evolving crisis: there is safety in numbers — except when there isn’t.","27.03.2023"
"Will Canary Wharf become a financial ghost town?","Plus, a Chinese blockbuster IPO poses a $9bn dilemma for western banks and the succession question plaguing Italy’s fashion houses","Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: The great Canary Wharf migrationWestern banks’ Syngenta dilemmaItaly’s luxury brands grapple with succession Dealmakers ditch Canary Wharf The demise of London as a global financial centre may be grossly overstated. But the same may not be true of London’s iconic business district, Canary Wharf. On Monday, HSBC became the latest big tenant to announce plans to leave the east-end Docklands. The British bank told staff that it expected to move to the former office of telecoms group BT — near the FT’s headquarters — in the City of London in late 2026.  The exodus highlights a growing desire among the financial and professional services community to leave the Wharf. Several other banks, including Barclays, Citigroup and Société Générale, have been consolidating their operations in Canary Wharf, closing ancillary offices and subletting floors. That could spell trouble for its owners, Canadian investment giant Brookfield and sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority, which bought the site’s landlord Canary Wharf Group in a £2.6bn deal in 2015.  At the end of last year, just over half of the Wharf’s tenants were financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. That has come back to bite developers of the site as Brexit and a post-pandemic dealmaking drought have contributed to a growing appetite for downsizing. Canary Wharf has underperformed on revenue per available metre metrics since the pandemic, Lex notes, adding that trend is expected to continue. The area, which has been synonymous with Britain’s financial sector since Margaret Thatcher’s 1986 Big Bang financial reforms, is now scrambling to diversify. Canary Wharf Group said in its annual report that it was taking steps “wherever possible . . . to mitigate or avoid material consequences from this concentration”. This approach is likely to be prudent, as much of the legal community has already moved on to greener pastures.  US law firm Skadden Arps, a multi-decade tenant in the area, relocated to Bishopsgate in the City of London earlier this year. By moving there, it joined many of its peers including Allen & Overy, which left Canary Wharf in 2010. Clifford Chance, a UK magic circle firm, has announced it will be leaving the Docklands after its lease expires in 2028. Taking their place in the shadow of the skyscrapers are residential units and what promises to be “Europe’s biggest life sciences campus”. This shift has already begun. There are also plans to develop an affordable housing scheme. Brookfield and QIA are hoping that’ll be enough to make good on their investment. A ‘question mark’ for US banks on a $9bn Shanghai IPO For Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and other western groups that spent years building up often-unprofitable investment banking units in mainland China, the upcoming Shanghai initial public offering of Syngenta should be a dream come true. At $9bn, it could be one of China’s largest listings. More importantly, Syngenta, a Swiss-based producer of seeds and pesticides that operates in more than 90 countries, is one of the most international companies ever to list in China and has longstanding relationships with global banks. On its surface, it’s the perfect justification for their presence on the mainland. So it is no surprise that bankers at Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and HSBC — all of which have mainland investment banking businesses — have been lobbying for roles on the listing, according to multiple people with knowledge of the matter.  But even if they win roles, they might not be able to carry out the work. State-owned ChemChina, Syngenta’s owner for the past six years, is on a US government watchlist of companies with close ties to China’s military.  The banks are asking lawyers and political consultants if they can or should be part of the listing, yet most have no clear answer. That leaves the Asia-based bankers in a tough spot. “We do want to be a part” of the IPO, one told DD’s Kaye Wiggins. But “we always have the question mark — are we able to eventually work on this or not?” It comes at a time when some Asia-based bankers at western companies are questioning why they bother having mainland operations as geopolitical tensions rise and US banks, in particular, are being frozen out of Chinese listings. For now, the bankers seem to be in limbo. “Do we pitch it 100 per cent all in, or to 80 per cent of [our ability]?” one said. “You probably wouldn’t be all in.” The next trend in Italian luxury: consolidation Italy’s fashion houses are known for a few things, including expert craftsmanship and the visionary founders who still hold court over their kingdoms. But not even the industry’s most domineering personalities can withstand the test of time. The country’s luxury brands are facing a succession crisis, the FT’s Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli reports, as a lack of domestic investment makes them ripe for foreign takeovers. A model at the Prada Spring Summer 2024 show © AP French conglomerates have been making their way into Italy ever since Gucci narrowly dodged being wolfed up by LVMH in the late nineties. But its cashmere-clad billionaire founder Bernard Arnault is still on the hunt and private equity firms are also circling. Some brands have managed to stave off takeovers. Hong Kong-listed Prada, which announced this year that scion Lorenzo Bertelli is next in line, is still clinging to its empire in the shadow of swelling conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering. Privately owned Armani and Dolce & Gabbana are also holding tight. One solution, according to UBS’s Italy head Riccardo Mulone, is “consolidating cleverly” rather than trying to compete directly with French giants. Prada is often floated as the group that might lead a domestic consolidation effort as it is one of the largest in market capitalisation that has evaded being bought up. But the prospect is a long way off.

"State Street and Invesco eye listing of Japan active ETFs","The Tokyo Stock Exchange is expected to give the first such vehicles a green light later this year","Latest news on ETFsVisit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools Several global asset managers are considering listing active exchange traded funds in Japan as the country’s main bourse gears up to allow such vehicles, industry participants say. The Tokyo Stock Exchange plans to release in March or April final guidelines, which will require daily disclosures for active ETFs, and begin listings in June. Global asset managers as well as Japanese fund firms have expressed initial interest in the new product and are waiting for the exchange to finalise rules.  Invesco has no ETFs listed in Japan at present, but Alex Sato, Japan president and chief executive of Invesco, said the products could help the firm grow its retail business in the country. This article was previously published by Ignites Asia, a title owned by the FT Group. “We want to make sure that we’re not going to be late to the game,” he said. Just five global managers have established ETF businesses in Japan: BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, UBS Asset Management, Global X Japan and Samsung Asset Management. Meaghan Victor, Sydney-based head of SPDR ETF for Asia Pacific at State Street Global Advisors, said she would watch how Japan’s active ETF market developed.  She said that listing an active ETF would be an extension of the active funds SSGA already offers in the country. State Street has two ETFs listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and ABF Pan Asia Bond Index Fund.  It also has two active ETFs domiciled in the US that are available to Japanese investors — the SPDR Blackstone Senior Loan ETF and SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF. BlackRock is also among the global firms also believed to be looking into the benefits of Japan-listed active ETFs. BlackRock is the biggest global ETF manager in Japan, with nearly 30 listed funds. The firm’s iShares business in Japan also stands to benefit from the Bank of Japan’s ETF buying policy revised in October. BlackRock did not return a request for comment. Atsuo Urakabe, a researcher at the Nomura Research Institute who focuses on Japan’s asset management industry, said global managers might see active ETFs as a new opportunity to grow their business in Japan.  Globally, active ETFs are proving popular with investors. The products recorded net inflows of $122.64bn last year, bringing total assets to $488bn, up nearly 11 per cent from $441bn in December 2021, according to ETFGI. But market participants have expressed scepticism that active ETFs in Japan would instantly attract retail investors as the ETF market is less mature than those in other developed markets. Invesco’s Sato acknowledges that the overall appetite for ETFs has been slow in Japan compared with the rest of the world. Although retail and foreign investor participation in Japan’s ETF space has increased in the past decade, the Bank of Japan is still the dominant player with 63 per cent of fund assets as of July last year, according to data provider ETFGI. There were about 280 ETFs on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with $466bn in combined assets as of early August, according to Morningstar data. Nomura Research Institute’s Urakabe said he was sceptical of the business opportunity involving active ETFs. “I do not believe that the conditions are right for retail investors to use active ETFs for long-term asset building in Japan, partly because distributions, or dividends, from Japan-domiciled ETFs cannot be automatically reinvested,” he said. *Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

"VistaJet: get rich or fly trying","Plus, a chill descends on the biotech industry and Adani courts his bankers","Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter A deep look at VistaJetPharma execs react to FTC moveAdani’s charm offensive  Can Europe’s private jet maverick stay in flight? What’s a fair reward for ordering a flashy private jet that might turn out to be a white elephant? The question arises from Dan McCrum’s deep dive into the private airline VistaJet, its $4.4bn debt pile, and founder Thomas Flohr’s unusual relationship with Bombardier.  Flohr has spent 19 years building VistaJet into an exclusive club for the moneyed traveller. Hand over cash for one of its “Jet Cards” and you can be whisked across an ocean in a luxurious silver Global 7500, the world’s fastest business jet — VistaJet has 18 of them in its fleet of more than 300 aircraft. His capital-intensive strategy contrasts with market leader NetJets, which sells fractional ownership where customers pay for the jets. Charter firms typically manage aircraft for the super-rich, or buy second-hand ones.   So far the bond market, leasing companies and lenders that include the Canadian government have been willing to support lossmaking VistaJet’s strategy, even after auditor EY warned in its opinion on the 2022 accounts that “a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”.  They also helped fund a payday for Flohr, who has a side gig as an aircraft trader. He personally ordered the very fast jets from Bombardier in 2015, in effect acting as a middleman between the aircraft manufacturer and VistaJet. The group’s disclosures to bond investors indicate that for the 18 Global 7500s it paid approximately $1.1bn to Bombardier, and $224mn to Flohr, who owns 84 per cent of VistaJet.  Flohr told the FT that his stakeholders were happy with VistaJet’s financial performance, because the business was “transparent and predictable”, and that he ordered the aircraft at a time when VistaJet did not have the resources to do so.  He said he had never taken a salary or dividend, had reinvested every dollar of profit, and that “if the company bought an aeroplane from me, then they paid the market price for it . . . Whatever I have given the company or the company has given to me is never more than the difference between cost and market value.” Big pharma’s pipeline gets clogged News that the Federal Trade Commission was suing to block Amgen’s $28bn acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics has sent shockwaves throughout the corporate world. As we explained yesterday, FTC head Lina Khan and antitrust tsar Jonathan Kanter have — by many measures — been tough on dealmaking, but their decision to target Amgen/Horizon was unexpected because they weren’t thought to have much of an overlap. The move has left pharma bosses feeling like no one is immune. William Pao, Pfizer’s chief development officer, called it a “disaster” for the system of innovation that underpins the industry. Pao, of course, has a horse in this race. There is speculation that Pfizer’s proposed $43bn purchase of Seagen could be the FTC’s next target, though Pao said he remained confident it would be approved. Pharma executives are up in arms about the FTC’s decision to block Amgen’s acquisition of Horizon because it cuts at the heart of the business model pursued by large pharmaceutical groups: buy small or midsize biotech companies to replenish drug pipelines.  What the FTC is taking issue with here is something called pharmacy benefit managers, businesses that determine which drug prescriptions are eligible for health insurance reimbursements. As Lex explains, drugmakers fight to get PBMs to put their drugs on these lists and the bigger you are the more power you have. One person in the pharma industry who is siding with the FTC is Regeneron boss Leonard Schleifer. “I’m glad the FTC is looking at this,” he told the FT US pharma and biotech summit in New York. “In some respects, [it’s] the worst thing for our industry and we’ve got to shine a brighter light on it.” But Schleifer may be enjoying some schadenfreude. Regeneron is in a long-running legal dispute with Amgen over “bundling” of treatments. Adani prepares charm offensive  Four turbulent months since a bruising short seller attack, how does Indian billionaire Gautam Adani show his relationship bankers his appreciation? With a trip to see his unfinished airport near India’s financial capital of Mumbai. In fairness, that’s just one item on a three-day agenda, which also includes dinner with Adani Group leaders at a five-star hotel near the Mumbai international airport that Adani is already running and a trip to its remote logistics hub on the coast of Gujarat. The FT viewed an emailed invitation. Gautam Adani  © FT montage/Reuters/GVK/YouTube/AFP via Getty Images The trip will give Adani a chance to showcase his prized assets, while giving financiers face time with Adani’s top executives. The previously fast-growing group has been known for hosting elaborate trips for investors and bondholders — a person close to the company said similar events have been held for the past four years, albeit virtually during the pandemic. But this junket is the first since New York-based short seller Hindenburg Research released a scathing report on Adani, accusing the group of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation. Adani denied the allegations, but the group’s combined market valuation is still about $100bn down since the January short seller attack.

"Foreign investors start 2023 with record $21bn push into China stocks","Traders bet reopening rally for Chinese equities has further to run","Global investors have snapped up a record $21bn worth of Chinese equities this year, as robust economic data spurs traders to make larger bets that the reopening rally has further to run. Foreign buying of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed shares through Hong Kong’s Stock Connect programme has rocketed to Rmb141bn ($21bn) so far in 2023 — more than double the previous record for the same period in 2021. The Connect scheme, launched in 2014, allows investors with a presence in Hong Kong to access stock markets on the mainland.Alongside a sharp rise in US equities, Chinese stocks have posted substantial gains since the rally began last year. The country’s benchmark CSI 300 index of its biggest companies has risen more than 13 per cent since the end of October. Analysts said the recent surge in foreign demand for China stocks was driven by positive economic data published after the lunar new year holiday, which had helped reassure some investors who had remained skittish about the country’s growth outlook even after it began dropping President Xi Jinping’s economically disruptive zero-Covid policy.  “It’s spectacular compared to any other year since the launch of the connect,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Société Générale.  “Some foreign investors took a little bit more time to get clarification on the strength of the economic recovery and the policy support we were going to get this year,” he added. “The money has really come back in now that the market has got reassurance that 2023 will be all about growth.”  And while the CSI index is down about 1.6 per cent this week, the latest positive economic data — including the first growth in three months for Chinese manufacturing — has reinforced international investor confidence in China’s trajectory. “Economic data and developments in the past week have underscored our positive outlook on China,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for global wealth management at UBS, in a note this week.  On Tuesday rating agency Fitch upgraded its forecast for China’s economic growth this year to 5 per cent, from 4.1 per cent previously. “When everybody said they’d like to have a portfolio without China, that was the bottom,” said Alison Shimada at Allspring Global Investments. She said that Allspring was now “a little overweight” on Chinese equities after increasing its allocation on October 31 — a view that was “not popular at the time”.  Iain Cunningham, co-head of multi-asset growth at Ninety One, said more than a third of one $1.3bn fund at the asset manager had been allocated to equities, almost all of it in what he viewed as “exceptionally cheap” Chinese and Hong Kong-listed stocks.  Economists said China’s equity market could receive another boost when the country’s top policymakers gather in Beijing next month. “The first batch of allocation [to Chinese stocks] by global asset managers is almost done,” said Iris Pang, chief Greater China economist at ING. “But asset managers will think about their allocations again in March when China announces its [gross domestic product] and fiscal spending targets. Those numbers should begin another upcycle for China’s equity market.”","09.02.2023"
"Analysts pore over Ueda’s words for clues on Japanese bond policy ","New central bank governor uses a phrase that suggests yield curve control could end this year","In his inaugural press conference as Bank of Japan governor on April 10, the 71-year old academic Kazuo Ueda had to choose his words carefully. With Japanese consumer price inflation at a multi-decade high, and the gap between BoJ and other central bank policy now yawning, the arrival of a new helmsman would allow bond investors to let their imaginations run freely. They had been speculating that the BoJ would normalise its policy for some months. But their narrower, and more immediate concern, was whether, under new leadership, the BoJ would quickly abandon the yield curve control (YCC) regime it has deployed since 2016 to hold rates on the benchmark 10-year JGB at around zero per cent.    Based on the Ueda press conference, the ostensible answer appeared to be “no”. But, ahead of his first monetary policy meeting as governor, on April 27-28, some prominent economists wonder if this is a misreading. A number of them now argue that YCC could be scrapped later this month, or in an ad hoc announcement in mid-May — and will certainly be gone by June. But what supports this view? The stance of the previous regime would remain in place, Ueda assured the audience at his press conference. He also pointed out that it was hard to judge whether the conditions required for a theoretical normalisation — the BoJ’s 2 per cent inflation target — had yet been reached in a sustainable way.   When asked directly about the tenacity of the YCC regime, the new governor said: “In light of the current economic, price and financial conditions, it is appropriate to maintain the yield curve control for now.” Those comments, according to Bank of Singapore economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin, support the thesis that Ueda sees Japan’s current inflation as potentially transitory and are in line with the view that the market should not expect any immediate changes to the BoJ’s yield target, or to its negative deposit rate of -0.10 per cent.  And although UBS economist Masami Adachi still predicts that YCC will be abandoned in June or July, he says the press conference has lowered the conviction behind that call. In fact, he thinks an alternative path — in which the tolerance band of the YCC is expanded, or its focus moved to the shorter, 5 year, end of the yield curve — would be more consistent with Ueda’s comments at the press conference.  Following Ueda’s remarks, the temperature of market speculation over policy normalisation cooled. And, without the support of the normalisation updraft, the yen began to fall, sliding below previous multi-week lows in the ensuing days.  But Ueda’s wording, argues Nomura’s chief rates strategist Naka Matsuzawa, can be also be viewed as consistent with the theory that there are now serious plans to jettison YCC. He suggests that the more seriously the BoJ’s new leadership was considering policy changes, the less would be conveyed at the press conference. “In this respect, we could take . . . the press conference as an attempt to fool the market,” says Matsuzawa. Others note that a great deal hinges on how the phrase “for now” is understood. The Japanese words do not, by convention, imply the indefinite, open-ended timescale they suggest in English. On the contrary, says JPMorgan economist Ayako Fujita, the phrase offers only a very literal truth about how the speaker judges matters at that very moment. Economic conditions, she notes, can change tomorrow, next week or next month and the term “for now” provides no linguistic commitment to the status quo. © Richard A Brooks/AFP via Getty Images Fujita believes that scrapping the YCC has, in effect, become a pre-requisite for the new governor starting his job of governing. In her assessment, Ueda plans to normalise interest rate policy and, in order to do so, wants to restore a form of “normal” communication between the BoJ and the market that has not been possible with the central bank deploying unlimited resources to maintaining the YCC target.  In light of the current economic, price and financial conditions, it is appropriate to maintain the yield curve control for nowKazuo Ueda, Bank of Japan governor If Ueda’s words at the press conference are parsed correctly, claims Fujita, there is a subtle but distinct message: that he has now intellectually separated the YCC policy from the negative interest rate regime and the other pillars of the BoJ’s dovish monetary stance. For purely practical reasons, Fujita thinks the April meeting may prove a little too soon to pull out of YCC. So the favoured method may be to scrap it at an ad hoc event held shortly after Japan returns from its Golden Week national holidays, in early May.  But there is still a big difficulty to overcome, points out Nomura’s Matsuzawa: preparing the way for policy change with the government. Many members of the ruling LDP party are still strong advocates of the ultra-loose “Abenomics” policies that the BoJ under Haruhiko Kuroda supported with its own stance “There could be policy changes at the April meeting since the market is pricing in this possibility appropriately,” writes Matsuzawa in a note to clients. “But politics could be the biggest obstacle. There is also a risk that, as the BoJ lays the ground for changes, the government could leak the BoJ’s intention to change policy.”","17.04.2023"
"Banks crisis looks short but lessons must be more enduring","Markets have recovered from shocks in March but there is a new reality for investors ","Do you want the good news or the bad news? Luckily, it is the same either way: one month on, it seems the short, sharp banking crises on both sides of the Atlantic have fizzled out without causing an outright disaster. (Yet). No sensible investor wants to see a repeat of the 2008 crisis, and the IMF has reminded us that even the thin sliver of that possibility is something that keeps its officials awake at night. Its regular Global Financial Stability Report noted that financial risks had “increased rapidly” since the previous update in October. Tobias Adrian, director of the fund’s monetary and capital markets department, told the Financial Times that those risks were now “acute” and warned: “The financial system is being tested by the stresses that are being triggered by monetary policy tightening . . . The risk going forward is that the situation could create more stressors for the financial system.”  Sobering stuff. Even without any more blow-ups to add to the list, after Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US, as well as Credit Suisse in Europe, asset managers are nervous about what it all means for economic growth. It does not take a genius to figure out that banks are likely to tighten up further on household and commercial lending, potentially with alarming consequences.  The adverse treatment of some Credit Suisse bondholders also points to higher borrowing costs for banks, which is likely — on the margins at least — to constrain the economic recovery on the continent. Bank-reliant commercial real estate is in a tricky spot in both regions. And, yet, markets have recovered very nicely from the shocks of early March. Regulators assumed control of SVB on March 10. Since then, the S&P 500 has risen about 7 per cent — a nose ahead of global stocks and more than making up for the sell-off just before SVB’s demise. Calm before the storm? Maybe. We all remember that the crisis of 2008 did not happen in one day — it was a tragedy in several acts. But it does seem reasonable to conclude that the string of bank failures has passed without morphing in to something uglier. David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients that he had always been “sanguine” about the risks stemming from that period in early March, albeit with some “nail-biting moments” when bond market volatility exploded. Now, he is feeling vindicated. “Thus far, there seems to be nothing systemic in play,” he said. “I will therefore stick with my initial assessment: The road may be bumpy, but this is not [an] Armageddon moment.” So how can this be bad news, for equity investors at least? Here to spoil the party is Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS. He points out that a big reason why stocks have rebounded so healthily from the shock of multiple bank failures is precisely because at the time, bond markets responded with such horror. In part because of investors’ urge to find safety, and in part because some investors were saying that interest rates would stall and possibly even fall quickly to soften the blow of the bank failures, US government bonds rocketed in price, cramming down yields.  “Banking stress proved sufficient to quell the market’s number-one worry: rising rates,” wrote Baweja and colleagues in a note this week. Two-year US government debt yields — the tightest reflection of interest rate expectations — have dropped by more than a full percentage point since early March and other market metrics suggest that investors are anticipating as much as another full percentage point over the coming year. This increasingly feels like a big overreaction, and one that many investors believe has been exaggerated by unusually high levels of speculation from hedge funds and other quick-firing accounts that had been betting against shorter-dated debt.  As Baweja notes, it “sounds reasonable” that the US Federal Reserve might cut interest rates, until you consider that unemployment is much lower and inflation is much higher than at other points when rate-setters have gone into reverse.  The upshot is that any boost to equities that has come as a mechanical response to lower bond yields in the two asset classes’ tried-and-tested see-saw relationship, is on shaky ground. “Equities are running out of fixed income help here, and we believe it’s once again time to consider buying downside protection,” he said. This all underlines something that fund managers know, but often struggle to take on board: the game has changed.  “Inflation may fall, but the era of ultra-low inflation is behind us,” said Karen Ward, chief global strategist for Europe at JPMorgan Asset Management. That ties central bankers’ hands and makes it essentially impossible for them to cut rates to get out of spots of trouble, even if they wanted to. (Highly targeted responses to the UK bond market crisis last year, for instance, suggest they do not).  “I don’t think we are going back to the low inflation world we had in the past,” Ward said. “It’s really important for us as investors to recognise that.” If stocks do unravel from here, this whole episode will enter the textbooks as yet another example of the sometimes painful process of accepting this new reality.

"End of the line? Italy’s fashion houses face succession dilemmas","The personalities of visionary founders have shaped the country’s foremost brands. Can they prosper without them?","One of the biggest twists in the storied history of mergers and acquisitions between Europe’s fashion houses is the moment in 1999 when Gucci narrowly missed being swallowed by LVMH. The Italian couturier had gone through a rocky patch after the death in 1983 of Rodolfo Gucci, who co-led the company with his brother. Rodolfo’s son, Maurizio, inherited 50 per cent of Gucci, sparking years of bitter family acrimony, and as chief executive he steered the business towards near-bankruptcy. Domenico De Sole, the Gucci family’s former lawyer and head of its US business, was appointed CEO in 1993. With the help of lead designer Tom Ford, he transformed Gucci from a lossmaking company to a profitable group whose womenswear designs were global hits.   But by 1999, a power struggle that had been brewing for years spilled into the open. Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire founder of luxury group LVMH, had been quietly building a stake in Gucci and when he owned close to 35 per cent of the company he sought to take control. Desperate to avoid a takeover under LVMH’s terms, De Sole arranged talks with several other Italian fashion companies. He hoped to draw up an alternative investment plan. “But nobody stepped up,” De Sole tells the FT. “There was fierce competition [between the brands at the time] and no real attempt to create an Italian group.”  Designer Tom Ford, left, and former Gucci CEO Domenico De Sole at an Yves Saint Laurent show in 2004 © Diaz Enrique/ABACA/Shutterstock Eventually De Sole found a white knight investor in François-Henri Pinault, the French founder of what is now luxury group Kering. “Pinault was quick. We were introduced by Morgan Stanley bankers in London, I told him the story of the house of Gucci, we shook hands and it was done,” De Sole says. Pinault bought a 42 per cent stake for €3bn, diluting LVMH to around 20 per cent.  Decades on from Gucci’s succession drama and the fraught sale that paved the French conglomerates’ way into Italy, a number of Italian houses still dominated by their visionary founders are now facing succession dilemmas of their own.  While Hong Kong-listed Prada this year announced that scion Lorenzo Bertelli is due to take over, Armani and Dolce & Gabbana — the only two big Milanese names that are still privately owned — are holding on tight to their empires, for now. “In many cases these are first-generation fashion founders who are viscerally attached to their business,” says Marco De Benedetti, co-head of Europe at Carlyle, the private equity firm.   The personalities and creative vision of founders such as Giorgio Armani, Miuccia Prada and husband Patrizio Bertelli, and Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, have deeply shaped the aesthetics and public perception of their brands.  © Matteo Corner/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockInfo© Daniele Dal Zennaro/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockInfo Armani Founded: 1975, by Giorgio Armani and Sergio Galeotti in MilanPersonal luxury sales, 2022: $2.83bn The succession plan In 2016 Giorgio Armani created a charitable foundation which will eventually own an undisclosed stake in his fashion empire. Nieces Roberta and Silvana Armani work for the group, while Andrea Camerana, his nephew, is a board member. They will inherit the rest of the company and under the set up they will only be allowed to sell their stakes to the foundation. The degree to which the founders underpin the brands’ commercial and critical success is a consideration for investors and insiders who question whether the brands will be as popular once they are gone.  “It really varies from brand to brand, but a lot has to do with how prepared a company is for succession,” says De Sole. “The creative director role is critical for brands, but management is also key,” he adds.  But the questions of succession facing these firms also have industry-wide implications. While Italy is rich in heritage and craftsmanship, it has lacked domestic investors with the will and the financial power to protect its industry from foreign takeovers. “The mentality in Italy has always been that small is beautiful,” says De Benedetti.  Now, according to analysts and insiders, the biggest threat to Italian high fashion is that the remaining jewels could be bagged by French giants such as Kering and LVMH. Following its near-miss with Gucci, LVMH, which owns more than 70 luxury brands, has added multiple Italian companies to its portfolio, including Rome-based Fendi, Loro Piana, famous for using rare raw materials for its garments, and high-end jeweller Bulgari.  Gucci-owner Kering has been on a similar spree. It acquired accessories maker Bottega Veneta, known for its woven leather designs, in 2001, and it later bought formal menswear group Brioni and Pomellato, a luxury jewellery company.  “Traditionally, Italian fashion entrepreneurs were extremely competitive with their closest neighbours [in Italy] which ultimately meant they would rather sell to the French than to domestic competitors, which helped Kering and LVMH develop in scale,” says Riccardo Mulone, head of Italy at UBS. LVMH, Europe’s most valuable company, has a market capitalisation of €422bn, while Kering is valued at €63bn.  In contrast Prada and Moncler, Italy’s two largest luxury groups, are each worth between €18bn-€19bn.  In recent years there has been a dawning awareness among Italy’s political class of the benefits the fashion industry brings both to the domestic economy and the country’s soft power abroad. But retaining Italy’s most prized brands is not guaranteed, analysts say. To do so there will need to be a wholesale shift in the way historical rival brands deal with each other. “We must have the courage to imagine a future where Italian brands also own what they do,” said the late Giusi Ferré, a distinguished fashion writer, in an upcoming documentary, Milano: the Inside Story of Italian Fashion.  Ferré added: “Maybe Italy is too small or we aren’t bold enough?” Inside the lines Italy has a centuries-long tradition of being a hub for tanners, textile makers and artisans. In the 1950s, Italian alta moda, or high fashion, began to be perceived as a threat by French competitors, who had dominated the fashion scene since the 1800s.  France responded with a state-sponsored “couture plan” aimed at subsidising its textile companies and strengthening its ties with the domestic couture industry.  Italy had no such top-down help. However, an economic boom in the 1970s, along with expanding global markets and rising consumer demand, ultimately propelled the country’s luxury fashion industry on to the world stage.  Assistance came from endorsements when celebrities, from Sophia Loren to Sharon Stone, favoured Italian designers for film premieres and other public appearances. Stone once said her first ever fashion splurge was a “super expensive Armani suit” when she auditioned for the leading role in Basic Instinct in the early 1990s.  Today, 78 per cent of global luxury fashion is made in Italy, according to a Pambianco-PwC report. In 2021, in spite of the pandemic, Italy’s fashion and textile industry had a total turnover of €93bn. The sector is made up of more than 60,000 small and medium-sized businesses, according to Confindustria Moda, the trade body.  “Fashion is the country’s second-largest industry and it employs millions of people directly and indirectly,” says Carlo Capasa, the head of Italy’s national fashion chamber, Camera della Moda, the organiser of Milan Fashion Week.  © Robino Salvatore/Getty ImagesInfo© Matteo Bazzi/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockInfo Dolce & Gabbana Founded: 1985, by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, in Legnano Personal luxury sales, 2022: $1.38bn The succession plan Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce had originally planned to shutter their company once they retired. “Once we’re dead, we’re dead. I don’t want a Japanese designer to start designing Dolce & Gabbana,” Gabbana once told Italian daily Corriere della Sera. That plan was reversed in 2019 when the fashion power duo said they were going to leave the business to the Dolce family. In recent decades, growth has led to stock market listings. While some brands including Moncler, Ferragamo, Brunello Cucinelli and Tod’s went public in Milan, Prada opted for Hong Kong in 2013 as its Chinese market boomed, and Zegna listed in New York in 2021.  De Sole says that going public changes the nature of the business, with executives and founders suddenly having to cater to investors’ interests. For Italy’s fashion houses, there has been an advantage. “This has pressured the groups to come up with succession plans and be more rigorous in running their companies,” he says.  Milan-based Prada Group, for example, appointed a new management team to supervise the generational transition that will see Lorenzo Bertelli eventually take over the company from his parents Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli.  Belgian designer Raf Simons, who is Miuccia’s co-creative director, shut down his own brand a few months ago to devote himself entirely to Prada — a sign he is likely to take the creative helm of the label once Miuccia retires.  Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana recently updated their succession plans, which originally envisaged Dolce & Gabbana shutting down after their departure. Now they want the Dolce family to take over instead.  Giorgio Armani, who at 88 is still the chief executive and creative director of his eponymous company, intends to transfer part of his empire to his charitable foundation in an effort to prevent takeovers or break-ups of the group.  “The future of the [company] Giorgio Armani is linked to me and I know I am not eternal,” said Armani in a rare on-screen appearance in the documentary Milano. “But my commitment is to manage the company for as long as I have left to live.”  A reluctance to open to outside investment has held back Italy’s fashion houses, Carlye’s De Benedetti believes. “It’s largely been a cultural thing, because the funds and willing investors were there,” he says. “But if the founder wants to keep control of the business at all costs, it doesn’t work out.”  Being part of a larger group has benefits. It gives companies opportunities to invest in technology and attract outside talent, which can lead to a brand’s revitalisation. Fendi, for example, is currently one of the most profitable brands in LVMH’s portfolio. When the fashion designer Valentino Garavani retired in 2007 following the sale of his company to London-based private equity group Permira, he anticipated “things would change”. But he hoped Valentino’s creative team would “do [him] proud”. Maria Grazia Chiuri (who has since moved on to Dior) and Pierpaolo Piccioli, the brand’s current creative director, are considered two of the most visionary minds in the modern fashion industry; Valentino was the fastest growing luxury company from 2013 to 2018. Since Pinault bought Gucci, funds have flown into Italy’s luxury sector from around the world, with conglomerates and private equity companies buying dozens of brands and suppliers. Analysts say such investments have ultimately been beneficial to the domestic industry.  Brands such as Valentino, now owned by the Qatari royal family, Michael Kors’ Versace, Gucci and Fendi continue to be strongly associated with Italy and their founders’ heritage in spite of their foreign ownership.  Beyond the scale of the luxury conglomerates, the “revolution” brought by owners such as Kering and LVMH has been the shift in the balance of power away from the founding families and on to the creative directors, says Sofia Gnoli, a fashion professor at Milan’s IULM University. “To sell a brand doesn’t mean it will automatically decline. If you get the creative directors choice right, a brand can thrive,” she says. Bottega Veneta’s autumn 2023 ready to wear show in Milan in February. The accessories maker was acquired by Kering in 2001 © Swan Gallet/WWD via Getty Images Creative directors are typically tasked with reinterpreting the heritage of each brand for modern customers, Gnoli adds. “When you can sell a €3,000 handbag by emphasising the brand’s glorious past, what investors do is buy a piece of history rather than spend money to create new brands.” Creative directors Tom Ford and Alessandro Michele, both formerly at Gucci, were among those who revamped a brand this way.  Ford, who recently sold his eponymous brand and retired from fashion, led Gucci’s successful turnround in the 1990s, rejuvenating its classic designs, such as the leather bucket handbag with the double G monogram logo, and expanding from accessories into womenswear. Michele, who succeeded Frida Giannini in 2015, transformed the brand’s aesthetic through his androgynous collections that revived Gucci’s popularity among younger consumers. He left the maison last year.  ‘Consolidating cleverly’ Analysts believe it won’t be as easy for foreign buyers to pounce on flagship Italian brands in the future.  Though most agree it is now too late for Italy’s industry to build a group that can compete with the French conglomerates in terms of size, experts see the Italian industry working more closely together — what UBS’s Mulone calls “consolidating cleverly”.  The mentality among fashion families is shifting. “Founders now wear their competitors’ brands, they go to each other’s fashion shows, they consult over important issues,” says Mulone.  Younger generations are likely to take the challenge of consolidation into their own hands, analysts say. Beyond the young Bertelli, the children of Zegna, Cucinelli and Florence-based Ferragamo, as well as Tod’s Diego Della Valle and Moncler’s Remo Ruffini, all work for the fashion houses controlled by their families. Prada is often floated as the group that might lead a consolidation effort as it is the largest in market cap alongside Moncler. But heir Lorenzo Bertelli told an FT conference last month: “Let’s see what is left to buy when the time comes.”  A degree of consolidation is already occurring in one critical arena: supply chains. “When it comes to luxury products, supply chain traceability is key, so there’s a push by big names to buy out their suppliers in order to secure the craftsmanship of their products,” says Mulone.  While the Covid pandemic accelerated the trend, several Italian groups, like their French competitors, have been vertically integrating their supply chains for years in order to secure the best raw materials and streamline production.  Zegna and Bertelli of Prada, for example, are on a self-proclaimed “mission” to protect “Made In Italy”, a merchandise mark that indicates that a product is entirely manufactured in Italy, from its design to its packaging. The Zegna and Prada groups announced this month a co-investment in high-end knitwear manufacturer Fedeli, where they acquired a combined 30 per cent stake. In 2021, the two groups bought a majority stake in wool and cashmere supplier Filati Biagioli.  © Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesInfo© Piaggesi/ROPI/Zuma Press/eyevineInfo Prada Founded: 1913 as Fratelli Prada, a leather accessories specialist, by Mario and Martino Prada in Milan Personal luxury sales, 2022: $4.75bn The succession plan Earlier this year the Prada Group announced that Lorenzo, the eldest of Patrizio Bertelli’s and Miuccia Prada’s two children, would eventually be taking over the helm of the group. To manage the transition, former Luxottica executive Andrea Guerra was brought in as group CEO and Gianfranco D’Attis was appointed as the first-ever CEO of the Prada brand.  In May, OTB, the Veneto-based group that includes brands like jeans maker Diesel, Jil Sander and Marni, announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Frassineti, a longtime supplier for Jil Sander’s accessories line.  These investments are unlikely to pave the way to broader consolidation of brands, says Citi’s head of global luxury Roberto Costa. “But at the same time we will see partnerships increasing between brands, leading to co-investments in supply companies, which also means acquiring their vital knowhow,” he adds.  De Sole, who sits on Zegna’s board with UBS chief Sergio Ermotti, says the €2.6bn group, like Prada, has the vision to spearhead the creation of Italy’s luxury hub. Some insiders, however, believe the industry and Italian institutions must be bolder in shielding the country’s fashion houses and its craftsmanship from foreign interest.

Fondo Strategico Italiano took a 40 per cent stake in the fashion house in 2018 for €70mn   © Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images The minister for businesses and Made in Italy, Adolfo Urso, has publicly stated that the government will be guided by “national interest” when assessing foreign investments in Italian companies. However, previous governments have stopped short from including the fashion industry and its suppliers in the list of strategic sectors, such as tech, transport and telecommunications, where it has the powers to veto foreign investments. “What is strategic for Italy if not the fashion industry?” says Capasa. “It’s what we’re known for throughout the world and younger generations want a future in fashion.” Capasa is putting together a “master plan” for the industry that will be presented to the Italian government in the autumn. Public institutions have recently stepped up their support of the industry. Italy’s Fondo Strategico Italiano, the publicly backed investment fund, for example, acquired a 40 per cent stake in fashion house Missoni, known for its bright and colourful high end knitwear, in 2018 for €70mn. The government is now mulling the idea of launching a national fund to invest in “Made in Italy”. But critics say domestic investments have been limited and Italian businesses and governments have lacked the vision to do what the French did to safeguard their flagship industry and historic domestic couturiers.  One industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity believes Italy “must ramp up its involvement in the fashion industry”.  A report by economic research institute Censis shows that €6bn in public investment in the sector over the next three years would spur production and increase revenues by €20bn.  “If we don’t do anything, the private equities and the foreign conglomerates will,” says the executive.

"A very Swiss identity crisis","The country’s sense of self as a haven for the world’s money and a beacon of neutrality is being shaken","“No one becomes a murderer more easily than a fatherland,” wrote Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Switzerland’s national playwright. Last weekend, the country killed one of its own. At a hastily convened press conference in the capital Bern on Sunday evening, the government and regulators announced Credit Suisse’s 167-year run as one of the pillars of Swiss society was over. The huge bank, the locomotive of Switzerland’s industrial miracle, weakened by years of scandal, was to be folded into its bigger rival UBS. The talk was of staving off an unthinkable financial collapse. There was little time for sentiment. The government “regrets Credit Suisse wasn’t able to master its own difficulties,” said Karin Keller-Sutter, Switzerland’s finance minister.  At the home of the deceased, a single candle flickered in the dawn breeze on Monday morning with a small bunch of flowers beside it — tokens of mourning placed to one side of the entrance to the Lichthof, Credit Suisse’s grand headquarters on Paradeplatz in Zurich. Over the previous 72 hours, technocrats, bankers and regulators in the capital had shuttled in and out of the Bernerhof — the office of the finance ministry, high on an escarpment above the river Aare — to finesse a solution. But they were working within a strict brief: the state was not going to use taxpayer money to preserve the bank’s independence. The deal shocked many around the world and raised questions about the stability the Swiss system sells itself on.  Normally in times of international economic stress, Switzerland is a haven: however, as gold and the Japanese yen rose against other assets this week, currency traders ditched the franc at the fastest pace in two years.

For months now, Switzerland’s neighbours and closest economic partners have been increasing the pressure on Bern over its steadfast refusal to be a part of any military help for Kyiv. The lobbying is becoming rancorous. “Neutrality has helped the Swiss for centuries on this war-torn continent. But it doesn’t work anymore,” says Thomas Borer, the former Swiss diplomat who wrote the country’s current neutrality policy. Switzerland is now surrounded by friends, he says, and deeply enmeshed with them economically.  “If you are neutral, it’s like going to a funeral, everyone is crying and you are standing around saying what’s the issue? No one likes you.” With two of the key facets of Swiss identity — its role as the world’s banker, reinforced by its geopolitical impartiality — in question, “We are in a perfect storm,” Borer says. “We have a lot of soul searching to do.” Centre of banking Even as the crisis on Paradeplatz reverberates, there is so far little evidence to suggest that Switzerland’s other top-tier banks — which cater to the world’s super-rich — will suffer.  Quite the contrary: many are now eagerly picking over the bones of their rival, looking to hire talented employees and poach lucrative clients. Julius Baer, formerly Switzerland’s third-largest bank by assets, and now its second, saw its share price rise 13 per cent this week. “This is a very unfortunate situation, there is no doubt about it. But from my perspective, it’s not so pessimistic,” says Hubert Keller, the senior managing partner of Lombard Odier, one of Switzerland’s oldest lenders.  “The strength of Switzerland as a financial place in the world has been built over decades and centuries. We are still the number one centre for cross-border wealth management.” We have to recognise that the liberal mainstream thesis of rational financial markets has been again proven to be rubbish Keller points to the doubts many had about Switzerland’s future when its banking secrecy was challenged after the financial crash of 2008. (Swiss banks now share skeleton information on foreign clients’ assets with foreign regulators, to prevent tax fraud). “Competitors abroad thought Swiss banking would not last after that, but they were proved wrong.”  For Keller, and many others in Switzerland, Credit Suisse’s problems ultimately stemmed from it becoming less “Swiss” — its push abroad and failed embrace of a foreign banking culture, emulating rivals on Wall Street by pursuing higher risks and higher returns. “Credit Suisse found itself playing in a different league and sometimes they played very badly,” says Mark Pieth, a legal scholar and founder of the Basel Institute on Governance. “In investment banking they were amateurs.” But concerns overseas may not be the sole worry for the banking sector. Credit Suisse is a part of Switzerland’s modern national identity story. And with general elections in October, the banking industry has become a political concern. For the rightwing populist Swiss People’s Party (SVP) — the largest in the country’s federal assembly — the bank’s decline, and the to-them-scandalous rescue that collapses it into UBS, are symptoms of subservience to foreign interests. Members of the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party protest in front of the headquarters of Credit Suisse this week © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images But for the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SP), the second largest, it is a tale of inadequate regulation and greed. “We have been trying to have clear and stricter regulations for years, but the rightwing liberal majority in parliament has always refused that,” says Cédric Wermuth, the party’s co-president. “In general we have to recognise that the liberal mainstream thesis of rational financial markets has been again proven to be rubbish.” The collapse of Credit Suisse could be a turning point, he suggests. “We are witnessing the moment where the financial sector that has been a huge benefit to Switzerland has become a huge liability. In the past, global crises have helped Switzerland strengthen its model — we were a safe haven. War or crisis, whatever happened, you could bring your money here. That didn’t change in 2008, but maybe it has changed this [week] at a very fundamental level.” The question of neutrality Banking is not the only area where long-established Swiss values are suddenly in question.  Switzerland’s doctrine of neutrality has been the cornerstone of its foreign policy for centuries, and it has not participated in a war since 1815. But that position has become harder to maintain in an era of European unification and economic interdependency. “The question over just what neutrality means was always there, in the background,” says Michael Ambühl, former state secretary of foreign affairs. “But it has come out to the forefront due to this war in Ukraine — and it’s obvious both to the political class and society that we need to clarify it.” At the sharp end of the issue is a question over arms deliveries: Swiss-made weapons exported to neighbours years ago now require permission from Bern to be re-exported.  A demonstration this month against the Russian invasion of Ukraine outside the House of Parliament in Bern. The war has called into question Swiss neutrality © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images For months, Bern has refused to allow countries such as Germany to send its mothballed stockpiles of Swiss ammunition to Kyiv. Berlin’s frustration has grown, and other Nato members have ratcheted up the pressure. The message from US ambassador Miller earlier this month was the strongest signal to Switzerland yet. Polls show a majority of Swiss — 55 per cent — support the re-export of arms. But politicians are sharply divided. And by constitutional design, nothing in Switzerland changes without consensus. The SVP is campaigning hard on the issue as a matter that goes to the core of what it means to be Swiss. What makes matters peculiar, however, is that Bern has so far matched all of the EU’s economic sanctions against Russia. Indeed, Switzerland was one of the first countries Moscow put on its official list of “unfriendly” nations last year. Bankers meanwhile warn that clients from certain countries — China foremost among them — are increasingly nervous about leaving their assets in Switzerland. That leaves the country with all the downsides of neutrality and fewer and fewer of the upsides, says one.  “Neutrality is in our books and in our genes, but that doesn’t mean we mustn’t adapt,” says Borer. “We have to.” Adapt or decline Those worried about the national character eroding have no shortage of metaphors to point to.  Earlier this month, Switzerland lost an appeal in US courts to give its iconic Gruyère cheese — from the valley of the same name in canton Fribourg — protected geographical status.  Bars of Toblerone chocolate will no longer display the Matterhorn on its packaging after Mondelez, the global food company, announced it would move the manufacture of them from Switzerland to Slovakia. Even the cherished national sport is suffering. This winter the Swiss Alps had some of the thinnest snowfall on record, with some of its slopes covered in mud and dead grass in the middle of January.  As with Credit Suisse, and as with neutrality, the common thread may be one of how “Swissness” either accommodates a rapidly changing world, or loses its purchase. Switzerland this month lost a legal battle to give Gruyère cheese protected geographical status — another blow to the country’s national identity © Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images Credit Suisse was one point of fracture, but there may be others, says Pieth. He points to the huge number of secretive commodity traders based in Switzerland that seem to operate as laws unto themselves. “Switzerland cannot go on operating under the radar,” he believes.  And yet over years of fierce independence, the country and its model have proved nothing if not resilient.  “The media and [its] contemporaries tend to overestimate the news,” says the Swiss historian Thomas Maissen. “In the autumn of 2001, we had 9/11, a rampage in Zug with 14 politicians murdered, a fire disaster in the Gotthard car tunnel, the crash of a Crossair plane and the grounding of Swissair.” The airline’s bankruptcy that October “was interpreted as the symbolic end of an era — of peaceful and successful Switzerland”.  Breathless features pondered the demise or slow decline of the nation. The opposite proved true. Switzerland’s freedom and safety endured, and its wealth grew: the Swiss economy, with a GDP of over $800bn annually, is more than twice as large now as it was then.  But if there’s a lesson in the debate surrounding the Ukraine war, says Ambühl, it’s that clinging to old certainties while the world is changing risks leaving Switzerland behind. “We have to adapt to new realities.”  Letters in response to this article: Swiss neutrality was ignoble then and is again / From Michael Romberg, London W1, UK William Tell could not have put it better / From Bijan Khezri, Khezri Capital Research International, Baar, Switzerland Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"South Korean battery groups’ domination of EV market in US faces China challenge","Ford’s deal with Chinese company CATL offers alternative model for carmakers","A plan by General Motors and Samsung SDI to spend $3bn on a new US battery plant makes clear South Korean companies’ dominance of the North American EV battery supply chain even in the face of a challenge by their biggest rival, China’s CATL. Aided by tax credits under US president Joe Biden’s flagship climate legislation, South Korea’s three leading battery companies have made themselves integral to EV manufacturing in the US. Of 22 EV models that the US said this month would qualify for the credits, 17 will receive supplies from LG Energy Solution, SK On or Samsung SDI. All three South Korean groups have set up joint ventures with US carmakers to produce batteries in North America. CATL, on the other hand, has struck a different kind of deal with Ford, which said in February that it planned to license technology from the Chinese battery maker for a proposed $3.5bn factory in Michigan.  While this will mean foregoing some subsidies available under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the carmaker will benefit from generous state-level subsidies while securing a supply of relatively low-cost batteries — a deal that could reshape the US battery market and undercut some of the ways that South Korean companies have made inroads. “Through Ford, the Chinese have forced their way back into the US market,” said Tim Bush, a Seoul-based EV battery analyst for UBS. The Ford-CATL deal “is a really negative development for the Koreans”, he said.  The IRA offers billions of dollars in subsidies for batteries that do not rely on Chinese minerals and components. Until February, its provisions appeared in effect to have eliminated Chinese battery makers from the race to take advantage of an expected explosion in demand for EVs in North America over the coming decade. All three South Korean companies have expertise in so-called nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, which are more expensive but have better range and performance than the cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in which Chinese battery makers specialise. Experts have said this makes NMC better suited to the US, where the average consumer is wealthier and more likely to drive further than in China.  However Ford’s decision to license LFP technology from CATL suggests a willingness to risk the wrath of policymakers in Washington in order to secure a supply of low-cost batteries for mass-market models.  The Michigan-based company will also benefit from part of the legislation that allows vehicles sold through leasing schemes — as opposed to being sold directly to customers — to circumvent some of its requirements. Ford had “fallen far behind General Motors in terms of securing IRA-compliant battery materials”, said Bush. “So instead it has found a workaround that allows it to bypass the requirements.” South Korean manufacturers are familiar with LFP technology. Last month LG Energy Solution, the world’s second-largest producer of EV batteries behind CATL, announced a $5.5bn investment in a manufacturing complex in Arizona, $2.3bn of which will be allocated to a plant producing LFP batteries. LGES has said it is in “active discussions” to supply Tesla. Although the LFP part of LGES’s investment is to make batteries for energy storage, experts said it also gave the company the option to produce LFP batteries for EVs in the US. Yet pivoting to the mass production of LFP in the US is not straightforward. “China has honed its LFP skills for decades,” said Sun Yang-kook, professor of energy engineering at Hanyang University in Seoul. “Korea will now have to go through trials and errors with LFP production.”  It remains unclear whether the Ford-CATL deal will come to fruition. Last month, Republican US senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation designed to prevent Ford from receiving any IRA tax credits for vehicles produced using Chinese technology.  But if it is successful, the emergence of a rival model to the joint ventures preferred by the South Korean groups — and Japan’s Panasonic — threatens to undermine the leverage of non-Chinese companies when negotiating with carmakers tempted by licensing arrangements for cheaper batteries. Analysts stress that the South Korean battery makers remain well-placed for rapid growth in western EV markets. This week, on the eve of a visit to the US by South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, Hyundai announced that it would invest $5bn in a US battery plant with SK On. “Korean battery makers have strong technologies, big capacity in major markets to secure scale, and well-established relationships with global car manufacturers,” said Hwang Kyung-in, a research fellow at the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics & Trade.  South Korean battery makers must also contend with lingering uncertainties surrounding the IRA’s implementation. Last month, the US Treasury issued guidelines that will make it easier for South Korean companies to source critical minerals for batteries from a wider range of countries, and to produce more components in South Korea itself. Washington is yet to spell out how it will define the “foreign entities of concern” that it wants phased out of the US battery supply chain — a thinly veiled reference to China that will determine South Korean companies’ ability to work with Chinese partners. Last week, LGES’s parent company LG Chem announced a memorandum of understanding with China’s Huayou Cobalt to set up a joint venture for a Won1.2tn ($915mn) plant in South Korea to produce precursors, a material used to make battery cathodes. “The question is what level of equity stake in these kinds of partnerships constitutes Chinese ownership or control in the eyes of the US government,” said Bush. “We don’t yet have an answer, but it will have implications throughout the supply chain.” Climate CapitalWhere climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here.Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets here","26.04.2023"
"Next Bank of Japan head Kazuo Ueda calls for ‘creative’ monetary policy","Academic says central bank should sustain easing measures until 2% inflation target in sight","The Bank of Japan should be “creative” with its monetary policy and pursue interest rate normalisation if it appears able to sustain its 2 per cent inflation target, the central bank’s expected next governor Kazuo Ueda has said. Addressing Japan’s Diet on Friday for the first time since his nomination this month, the 71-year-old economist signalled that he was in no rush to change Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy, explaining that future decisions would hinge on the inflation outlook. In comments that appeared to be intended to avoid disruption to financial markets, Ueda acknowledged that it would take time for Japan’s price growth to be maintained at the BoJ’s target level. He warned that tightening monetary policy under current conditions could slow the economy, as current inflation was not driven by underlying strong demand.  “There have been various side effects, but in light of the economic and price conditions, the methods have been necessary as well as appropriate to sustainably achieve the 2 per cent inflation target,” Ueda said, referring to the BoJ’s adoption of negative rates and yield curve control under incumbent governor Haruhiko Kuroda. “I believe it is appropriate to continue monetary easing measures while being creative in line with the situation,” Ueda added. Currency markets were little moved following Ueda’s comments, while Japan’s benchmark Topix was up 0.7 per cent and 10-year Japanese government bond yields fell slightly. Global investors had eagerly awaited Ueda’s parliamentary hearing after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida broke with precedent by nominating an academic for central bank chief, a role that historically rotated between officials from the BoJ and finance ministry. Many economists expect Ueda to gradually exit from two decades of quantitative and qualitative easing that has swollen the central bank’s balance sheet with massive purchases of ETFs and Japanese government bonds to keep yields low. The BoJ is also the last major central bank still holding on to negative interest rates, currently at minus 0.1 per cent. Ueda is known as neither a monetary policy dove nor a hawk. Analysts said his comments confirmed the view that he would take a pragmatic approach to decision-making that drew on market and economic conditions rather than ideology.  Addressing whether the BoJ would shift towards normalisation or maintain easing measures, Ueda said: “My biggest mission is to make sure that I do not make a mistake in making the decision in response to economic developments.” “It was a very balanced testimony,” said Masamichi Adachi, chief Japan economist at UBS. “He made it clear that if the price trend does not improve, then the BoJ would continue with easing measures while reducing their side effects.” Ueda spoke after government data showed on Friday that Japan’s core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food prices, climbed to a new 41-year high of 4.2 per cent in January on the back of rising costs of commodity imports. Core inflation has exceeded the BoJ’s target for nine straight months, but Ueda suggested the January figure was probably “the peak”, echoing the BoJ’s forecast that price growth would slow this year. In December, the BoJ surprised investors by announcing it would allow 10-year Japanese government bond yields to fluctuate by 0.5 percentage points above or below its target of zero, widening the previous band of 0.25 percentage points. It has since protected its target ceiling, but the bonds have come under renewed selling pressure as investors increase their bets that the central bank will abandon the yield cap on 10-year bonds under Ueda.  “The challenge for the BoJ is not to review the monetary easing policy because there are side effects but how it can be creative in effectively maintaining the easing stance,” Shinichi Uchida, a BoJ executive and nominee for deputy governor, told parliament. Both Ueda and the two deputy governor nominees are expected to be confirmed by parliament in March. Additional reporting by Eri Sugiura in Tokyo","24.02.2023"
"Investors join opposition to SEC stock market reforms","Fund managers doubt retail traders will benefit from changes aimed at improving transparency and pricing ","Several big investors have joined opposition to an ambitious stock market overhaul proposed by US regulators to improve transparency and pricing for smaller retail traders. The criticisms point to deep concern about elements of plans published in December by the Securities and Exchange Commission and promoted by chair Gary Gensler which amount to the biggest reform of equity trading in two decades. The regulator’s focus on the innards of stock trading follows the explosion in consumer interest during pandemic lockdowns. That produced the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy which collapsed in acrimony after overwhelmed brokers limited trading in several companies.   The SEC’s proposals to increase the data brokers publish and to shrink trading increments has gathered some support, albeit with suggested changes. The increments or “tick size” rule would allow stock prices to move up and down by less than a penny and in theory would improve pricing for the most in-demand stocks.  But more controversial is a plan to introduce its own “best execution” regime — mandating brokers to make all efforts to find the best price for investors — on top of similar standards that are already in place. The SEC also wants to force brokers to auction retail investor orders to a wider group of trading venues in a rebuff to the practice of “payment for order flow”. PFOF enables retail-focused brokers such as Robinhood to offer “free” trading to customers as market makers like Citadel Securities pay them to execute their orders.  The SEC’s ideas have stirred fierce debate among market participants over their potential impact. Comments on the proposals were due on Friday.  While retail brokers and market makers were expected to resist the proposals, which could threaten their current business models, several big fund managers are also sceptical that end users of the markets would benefit as the regulator intended.  Kenneth Bentsen, head of finance industry association Sifma, called on the SEC to study the extra data that would be collected under the most broadly supported proposal before deciding whether its more ambitious plans would benefit investors.   “We respect the SEC’s role as a policy and rulemaker, but it is acting very rapidly and largely on theory — and that could bring risk into the system,” he said. “Congress has looked at equity markets pretty closely in the last two years and its recommendations didn’t come close to what the SEC is proposing.”  Sifma’s asset management arm has submitted a separate letter that also questions the value of the auction rule and of adding another best execution rule. Others to have raised issues include Fidelity, BlackRock. State Street Global Advisors, T Rowe Price and UBS Securities. “We are concerned with the prescriptive nature of the proposal and believe that it does not clearly benefit retail investors and may disadvantage them,” said Fidelity. The fund manager is not involved in PFOF.   Retail trading reached record levels earlier this year, accounting for almost a quarter of all market activity on some days in late January according to JPMorgan analysts. The orders are considered particularly valuable. The largest stock exchange groups have also raised concerns despite being the intended beneficiaries of some of the proposals. Exchanges have lost substantial market share to less heavily regulated groups such as Citadel Securities over the past decade, and Gensler has been vocal about his desire to reverse the trend.  Yet in its response to the SEC’s plans, the New York Stock Exchange teamed up with Citadel to voice its concerns. Although they are competitors, Citadel Securities is also a key client of the NYSE and its parent group Intercontinental Exchange.   In a letter that was also cosigned by Charles Schwab, the largest retail brokerage, the NYSE and Citadel Securities urged the regulator to withdraw the auction and best execution proposals, and to significantly water down the others. They also requested the commission reconsider some previously agreed changes that were designed to increase transparency and would have been sped up under the most recent proposals. NYSE rival Nasdaq was less critical, but also called for a more “incremental and pragmatic” approach. It said the regulator’s focus on auctions to improve competition for retail investors was risky, and warned there was “no silver bullet solution.”  Its most vigorous criticism was targeted at the SEC’s plans to cut the fees that exchanges can charge for trading against their quotes. Nasdaq and NYSE use the fees to pay for rebates to other market makers and increase liquidity. Nasdaq said “it would be arbitrary and capricious for the commission to proceed with the proposal in the absence of evidence that the current fee cap is actually harmful”. However, not all exchanges were opposed. Brad Katsuyama, chief executive of IEX — which does not rely on rebates — said: “It has been nearly 20 years since the last major regulatory change in the stock market, making it hard to argue that modernising outdated rules will be bad for investors.”  The SEC is expected to take time to review the comments before deciding what amendments, if any, to make.

"Bundesbank chief says rate-setters must be ‘more stubborn’ in inflation fight","Joachim Nagel backs more rate rises as central banks on both sides of Atlantic wrestle with recent financial sector turmoil","Germany’s central bank boss said the eurozone must be “stubborn” and keep raising borrowing costs to tackle inflation, as rate-setters on both sides of the Atlantic wrestle with the recent turmoil in the financial sector. “Our fight against inflation is not over,” Joachim Nagel, Bundesbank president, told the Financial Times after he and other members of the European Central Bank’s governing council stuck to plans to increase interest rates by half a percentage point last week. He was speaking ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s own rate-setting decision on Wednesday.   “There’s certainly no mistaking that price pressures are strong and broad-based across the economy,” Nagel said of the eurozone. “If we are to tame this stubborn inflation, we will have to be even more stubborn.” The Fed is set to decide whether to continue raising interest rates, despite the collapse of US lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. Analysts largely expect it to raise US borrowing costs by a quarter point.  Following the rescue-takeover of Credit Suisse on Sunday, Nagel said it was possible banks would become “more cautious” in lending. However, he added that it was too early to draw the conclusion that the region was heading for a credit crunch that would choke demand.  Nagel, who became Bundesbank president at the start of last year, downplayed the risk of contagion to the eurozone’s “resilient” banking system. “We are not facing a repeat of the financial crisis we saw in 2008,” he said. “We can manage this.” Joachim Nagel said it was possible banks would become ‘more cautious’ in lending following the market jitters © Ben Kilb/FT Nagel displayed little sympathy for owners of SFr16bn ($17bn) of additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds in Credit Suisse, which were wiped out by Swiss authorities as part of the UBS rescue-takeover.  “Those who profit from opportunities should also take their share when risks materialise,” he said. “This was one of the takeaways from the global financial crisis.” But he confirmed that the eurozone would not follow the Swiss decision to bail in AT1s before a bank’s equity was wiped out.  Markets increasingly expect the ECB to pause its rate increases in May as financial conditions worsen.  However, Nagel said eurozone inflation had to drop “significantly and sustainably” from 8.5 per cent — more than four times the ECB’s 2 per cent target — before the bank would stop raising borrowing costs. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, would also have to “decline sufficiently” after it hit a record of 5.6 per cent last month, he said.  “There’s still some way to go, but we are approaching restrictive territory,” he said, adding that once the ECB stopped raising rates it would then have to resist calls to cut them. Doing so would enable “inflation to flare up again”, as it did after the oil supply shocks of the 1970s. Nagel is determined to maintain the German institution’s traditional “hawkish” stance. As the biggest shareholder in the ECB, the Bundesbank has an important influence on policy, though Nagel’s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, was often isolated in his resistance to more dovish monetary policy.  Nagel will visit the UK this week, including the House of Lords where he will make the first appearance by a Bundesbank president since Hans Tietmeyer in 1998.  He maintained a bullish outlook for the German and eurozone economies, saying: “I still envision a soft landing.”  His optimism on growth — and anxiety over inflation — was largely down to the eurozone’s “extraordinarily robust” labour market. Unemployment remains at record lows despite the ECB raising interest rates by an unprecedented 3.5 percentage points since last summer.  “This is a very exceptional cycle,” he said, adding that raising rates in the past had led to significant job losses.  Another difference was that the banking system remains awash with €4tn of excess liquidity, stemming from years of vast bond purchases and ultra-cheap lending by the ECB.  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here The bank this month started to shrink its bond holdings by not replacing €15bn of the securities that mature each month in its €3.2tn asset purchase programme.  But Nagel, whose first job at the Bundesbank involved calculating excess liquidity levels, wanted to go faster. “We should do more,” he said, when the council reviews the strategy in July.  He added that “at a later stage” the ECB could also consider shrinking a separate €1.7tn pandemic emergency purchase programme, launched in 2020 to counter the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. While he praised ECB president Christine Lagarde’s ability to “bring people with different views together”, the consensus on the ECB council could soon be tested. “It’s when the going gets tough that you find out how good a team really is,” he said.","22.03.2023"
"Credit Suisse fallout threatens to halt issuance of risky bank debt ","Some of Asia’s largest lenders may pause sales of additional tier 1 bonds after $17bn wipeout at Swiss bank ","The wipeout of $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds has thrown into question further issuance in the market for risky bank debt, with some of Asia’s biggest banks considering pausing sales.  Major banks in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong are placing new additional tier 1 (AT1) bond deals on hold until market conditions stabilise, according to people familiar with the plans. The hiatus follows three days of turmoil triggered by the decision to write down the value of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bond to zero as part of the bank’s takeover by Swiss rival UBS, while shareholders received $3.25bn. AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet.  Regulators in the eurozone, UK and Hong Kong have stressed that they will not follow Swiss authorities in upsetting the usual hierarchy of bank creditors.  Even so, prices in the $260bn AT1 market have tumbled this week. Analysts and investors have warned that buyers are likely to demand substantially higher borrowing costs, potentially creating a “zombie market” where banks are reluctant to issue fresh debt to refinance older bonds. “There is no point for Asian banks to issue at such elevated yield levels, but I do expect the fundamentally stronger ones to come back to issue AT1s when the market stabilises,” said Nicholas Yap, head of Asia credit desk analysts at Nomura.  MUFG and SMFG, two of the three banks responsible for the lion’s share of AT1 issuance, were expected to issue AT1 bonds in April and were already sounding out investor appetite when the crisis at Credit Suisse erupted.  People with knowledge of the planned sales say the banks may now have to adjust their terms or pause the issuance depending on how badly investor sentiment has been hurt by the wipeout at the Swiss bank. Bond traders said the pipeline for new AT1 issuance in Hong Kong was now empty, and was unlikely to restart until the second half of the year.  The fallout from the Credit Suisse deal “changes the whole nature of the [AT1] market, and I think the ability to issue going forward is probably close to zero”, said Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer of PGIM Fixed Income. “Basically, it’s a zombie market going forward in my mind.” AT1s were designed in the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis as a way for bondholders to shoulder a greater portion of the losses at failing banks and avoid taxpayer-funded bailouts. The bonds are perpetual and have no pre-determined maturity, although they are typically repaid once an initial “non-call” period expires and refinanced with fresh issuance. Investors value the flexibility of getting their money back and choosing whether to buy new bonds. Part of the reason for the fall in prices is that investors are factoring the “extension risk” of banks not calling their bonds, according to Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist at Goldman Sachs. UniCredit, Crédit Agricole and Barclays are among the European banks with “call” dates this year. But looking at the broader AT1 market, “2023 is relatively on the benign side”, said Karoui, with “no imminent refinancing needs”. “I would probably expect issuers to act rationally and wait for funding costs to come down” before rolling over their AT1s, he said, adding that roughly 60 per cent of the current stock of European AT1s would hit their first call dates before the year-end 2026. At least one Singapore-based bank has stopped issuance, said one person familiar with the market.  DBS, Singapore’s biggest bank, said it had no AT1 issuance plans. The bank assured investors it was well capitalised and its exposure to Credit Suisse was “insignificant”. DBS has issued a number of AT1 securities in the past.   OCBC, another top Singapore bank, did not respond to a request for comment.  Most analysts argue that the decision by Swiss authorities to wipe out AT1 holders should not be seen as a precedent for other jurisdictions. Still, it has led to nervousness across the global market for bank bonds. The risk officer at one Chinese state bank said the lender would be more cautious in valuing the writedown risks on AT1s, and would no longer “blindly believe” that a Swiss-style 100 per cent writedown could never materialise. One Hong Kong-based wealth manager with a large China presence said the global market for AT1 bonds was effectively “dead” for the short term. “Any bank planning new issuance will have to offer an impossibly high premium to have a hope of attracting investors after this.” Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"Lex hits and misses: banking on rates, fumbling on fund managers","Irish and Spanish banks have been some of the biggest beneficiaries","Working for a financial publication does not grant you special powers when it comes to predicting the machinations of money markets. Economist JK Galbraith had a point when he divided forecasters into two groups: those who do not know and those who do not know they do not know. Nonetheless, the prospect of higher interest rates gave us confidence in hailing a turnround in the European banking sector’s fortunes.  Lex was broadly correct in forecasting that revenues would rise, with the caveat that fees would be put at risk. The biggest gainers were the Irish and Spanish banks which have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of higher rates. Lex tipped AIB when Ireland’s government announced it would start reducing its holding at the start of the year. The bank is also benefiting from NatWest’s exit from the Irish market, reducing competition.  NatWest has itself outperformed. The bailed-out British bank has been buying back shares from the government, reducing the share count and overhang.   Consolidation and larger amounts of variable rate lending are aiding bank earnings in Spain too. Nimble operator Bankinter caught our eye in January because of its focus on wealthier customers.   Our predictions concerning Ukraine were accurate, regrettably. We thought UniCredit was wise to swerve a deal for Otkritie to boost its Russian exposure in January. For Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank, holding 20 per cent of its equity in the region was an obvious risk.  Rising rates have not helped everyone. We misjudged the impact on asset managers. Morgan Stanley and Amundi have been successful at asset-gathering. But that did not stop fees, earnings and share prices all drifting lower with the value of managed assets. Alternatives groups such as Blackstone and EQT have had a great run providing yield-generating assets to pension funds. But higher bond yields make that proposition far less sturdy.  Fund manager readers should not write us off just yet though. We thought UBS was wildly overpaying for robo adviser Wealthfront at $1.4bn in January. A reversal in September shows that we were probably right.  Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

"Global banking is now inside Schrödinger’s box","Investors must trust in the system but confidence is wobbling and there may be more toxicity to come","The writer is an FT contributing editor The famous quantum mechanics thought experiment posits that if a cat is sealed in a box with a deadly substance, you can’t know whether it is still alive until you open said box. In the meantime, it is simultaneously alive and dead. And so it is with banking today: we can’t know if the past week was a series of idiosyncratic, containable issues or the start of a 2008-style banking crisis. At the moment it is both. Investors and depositors must not only believe that banks have good capital ratios, ample access to liquidity and behave responsibly, but also that the supervisory and regulatory architecture put in place after 2008 to save the system works. In the short term, there can be gradations of confidence in all of this. But when we finally look in the box, investors must either trust all of these things or none. It is a binary outcome: the cat can’t be a little bit dead.  Reason points to the recent banking instability being a series of containable issues, mostly based on supervisory and management issues. Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank were unusually exposed to interest rate risk through both their clientele (itself a phenomenon of a low-rate environment) and their assets (long-term bonds that had to be sold at a huge loss to redeem deposits). First Republic, with a wealthy depositor base that might largely be uninsured, has also been caught up in concerns about liquidity. Credit Suisse, in trouble many times before for a litany of reasons, is now dealing with both confidence and liquidity concerns.  The good news is a lot has changed since 2008. Banks are far better capitalised and regulated than before the global financial crisis. And as awful as that period was, we learnt many lessons from it, among them the importance of swift, decisive action to stem contagion.  Central banks immediately dusted off the playbook for addressing a liquidity crisis and stepped in as lenders of last resort. The US Federal Reserve, Treasury and FDIC guaranteed all deposits for SVB and Signature Bank, and the Fed created a new lending programme, the Bank Term Funding Program, for banks with underwater securities on the books to access at par. The Swiss National Bank extended a credit line of up to SFr50bn ($54bn) to Credit Suisse. The bad news is that so far trust in the banking sector has not been restored. A week after the US programmes were announced, First Republic remains under pressure — even after receiving $30bn in deposits from larger banks. Its shares fell 33 per cent on Friday. All of the banks in the KRE banking ETF were down; the index closed off by 6 per cent. Fed data showed it loaned $11.9bn through its new facility in the week up until last Thursday and a record high of $152.9bn through its usually stigmatised discount window. Clearly, liquidity is a concern across the US system. And the new credit line was not enough to save Credit Suisse: the Swiss authorities organised a weekend sale of the bank to rival UBS. Central banks and regulators must do more to restore confidence. Fundamental trust in the banking system is wobbling. And I worry more toxic things might still be added to Schrödinger’s box. Commercial real estate loans account for about 28 per cent of small banks’ loans in the US (relative to 8 per cent for the largest banks). Some of these are underwater given high interest rates and the pandemic shift to working from home. If even a few small banks have to write down assets, solvency questions will become contagious. Another risk lies in private markets. They do not have to mark to market, and have booked much smaller paper losses than public markets over the past year. They may delay crystallising losses in the hopes that asset values reflate in the meantime. If assets continue to fall, however, the losses could be staggering. Private markets could undermine financial stability.  We shouldn’t assume the cat is dead and a banking crisis is upon us, but we will keep hitting pockets of market dislocation as central banks continue to withdraw liquidity by raising rates and shrinking balance sheets. This is the third time in two decades we’ve had banking issues, after the financial crisis and eurozone crisis. More needs to be done to rebuild and maintain confidence in the system. Even if the cat is alive this time, we can’t assume it has nine lives.","19.03.2023"
"Should Lazard go private?","Plus, Alibaba names its newest leader and EU antitrust cops set their sights on Adobe’s $20bn takeover of Figma","One scoop to start: JPMorgan Chase is aiming to recover millions of dollars from an insurance policy that protected the US bank against fraud after its botched $175mn acquisition of financial aid start-up Frank, according to people familiar with the matter.  Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter:   Lazard’s deal talk with Abu DhabiThe shake-up at AlibabaAdobe’s $20bn headache  Lazard must decide its future This week Lazard’s senior leadership gathered in Paris to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the storied boutique investment bank. If things played out differently, however, the festivities could have been a closing ceremony on something else: Lazard’s time as an independent, publicly traded company. ​ Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, left, and outgoing Lazard chief executive Ken Jacobs © FT montage/Reuters/Bloomberg Yesterday, your friends over at DD revealed that Lazard held detailed talks earlier this year with Abu Dhabi state fund ADQ about a deal to take the advisory and asset management firm private.  The talks, which are no longer active, underscored the ambitions of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, the powerful brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, who has had a tilt at various financial services companies over the past 12 months including Standard Chartered.  For Lazard, which is preparing for a leadership transition and a strategy refresh later this year, the revelation of the talks raise an intriguing question: is the company, with a $3.7bn market capitalisation and $1bn of net debt, better off going private? Lex points out that Lazard’s mix of volatile or out-of-favour businesses is not a great fit for the mutual funds that dominate public stock markets. Going private may be best but there is no easy way to achieve that given that Lazard’s public shareholders will want a hefty premium to be bought out. And there is no single large Lazard shareholder able to be an anchor rollover investor or financing source. At the same time, a buyer will be wary about overpaying for a talent-driven business where the best assets can walk out the door at any time. Still, across Wall Street and Europe, Lazard’s multiple peers are finding ways to move away from public markets. Earlier this year, Alexandre de Rothschild told the FT: “You can’t be half pregnant,” as he unveiled a €3.7bn deal to take Lazard’s longtime Anglo-French rival Rothschild private.  Meanwhile, Greenhill, the struggling boutique advisory firm, which was once at the vanguard of a new generation of upstarts on Wall Street when it listed in 2004, decided to sell itself to Japan’s Mizuho for $550mn.   As Lazard’s top brass decide what to do next after their France soirée, they can take comfort from the fact that the firm has survived on its own through all sorts of internal and external upheaval for nearly two centuries, outlasting and outsmarting plenty of rivals and naysayers who were certain of its demise. Alibaba’s latest management shake-up  Alibaba’s longtime chief executive Daniel Zhang, who led the company through Beijing’s turbulent regulatory crackdown, will be replaced by a loyalist to co-founder Jack Ma. Eddie Yongming Wu is stepping up as Alibaba’s chief in September as the internet giant breaks up its sprawling empire and returns to its roots as an ecommerce company. As part of the shake-up, Joseph Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba, will replace Zhang as chair of the board. While Tsai is one of the most prominent executives straddling the fraught economic relationship between China and the US and owns the National Basketball Association’s Brooklyn Nets, Wu carries a far-lower profile.  Quiet and analytical, Wu grew up in the Alibaba professional ecosystem.  A graduate of a nearby university in Hangzhou, he joined Ma’s first internet venture China Pages, before becoming a founding member of Alibaba in 1999. The pair grew close after Ma was impressed by Wu’s technical capabilities and appointed him as his special assistant between 2014 and 2019. That was a year before Ma’s dramatic fall from grace. Just weeks before Alibaba’s sister group Ant Group was set for a blockbuster IPO in December 2020, Ma launched a public tirade against the financial regulators, accusing them of stifling innovation.  It set off a cascade of events culminating in the IPO’s cancellation and a regulatory crackdown on China’s big internet groups that wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off their collective market value.  Alibaba has emerged from the wreckage of that campaign seeking to re-establish itself as the undisputed king of ecommerce in China. Its flagship online shopping sites Taobao and Tmall have ceded territory to new upstarts Pinduoduo and Douyin. Wu drove the launch of the Taobao shopping app, which quickly became a critical part of Chinese consumers’ daily shopping habits. He will continue to serve as chair of the wholly owned Tmall and Taobao subsidiary. The question is whether Wu’s appointment will mean Ma, who has spent much of the past two years out of China, working on his philanthropic endeavours, will also play a more active role in the company he founded 24 years ago. EU put Adobe’s $20bn deal for Figma at risk When it comes to tech deals, companies should be bracing themselves for deeper scrutiny. The latest victim of antitrust regulators is Adobe, whose $20bn proposed acquisition of cloud-based design tool Figma is in the crosshairs of EU officials. Their concern? That the transaction will, in effect, eliminate one of Adobe’s serious competitors from the market. As a result, the transaction is likely to head to a full probe later this year, several people familiar with the EU’s thinking told DD. Regulators have become increasingly concerned that the deal may be a “killer acquisition”, in which a big company acquires a smaller rival to eliminate competition. “Adobe is trying to buy a credible competitor,” one of these people said. “It’s bad.” But Brussels is not alone in their worries. Last month, the UK opened an initial probe into the deal, and the US Department of Justice is reportedly preparing a lawsuit to prevent the transaction from proceeding. Don’t write off this merger just yet. According to several sources familiar with Adobe’s defence, the company is prepared to argue that the two businesses operate in separate markets. Internal research conducted by Adobe revealed that only 10 per cent of Photoshop users also used Figma, highlighting the minimal overlap in users. Good luck to them. They are going to need it.

"Pierre Salanitro: The gem-setter trusted by the big watch brands","The Genevan is expanding his creative reputation, built on supplying industry players, to launch his own luxury marque","A few days before the horological world descended on Geneva for the annual Watches and Wonders fair last March, the city’s Bailly Gallery was hosting an evening party. But this was no ordinary vernissage — it was a gathering of some of the most influential figures in the watch industry. A relaxed-looking Thierry Stern, president of Patek Philippe, was accompanied by several of his top managers, including Laurent Bernasconi, Jérôme Pernici, and Patrick Cremers. FP Journe founder François-Paul Journe and auction supremo Aurel Bacs were photographed with Tiffany & Co watch boss Nicolas Beau.  Then, there were guests from afar, such as retailers Michael Tay of The Hour Glass in Singapore and Ahmed Seddiqi of Dubai and Nasser Al Majed of Qatar, along with leading distributors and other retailers in some of the fastest-growing markets for watches. They had gathered to celebrate the launch of a new luxury goods marque, S by Salanitro, which was presenting its first objets de luxe, alongside works by Pablo Picasso and Pierre Soulages. There was a sculpture in gold and precious stones inspired by a Mesoamerican mask from 1,500 years ago; a “vanitas” mirror decorated with a huge skull made from 1,277 precious and semi-precious stones; and a backgammon board set with black diamonds and blue sapphires. Their creator, Pierre Salanitro, an engaging 57-year-old Genevan of Italian descent, describes them as “objects to make you dream”. Salanitro, owner of the brand, was the reason for the high-level horological executives in attendance. His name had meant little outside the world of watch industry suppliers until last September, when Patek Philippe announced that it was investing in the business. Thierry Stern, president of Patek Philippe (left), acquired a stake in Pierre Salanitro’s gem-setting business.  © point-of-views.ch But, within the industry, Salanitro is recognised as one of the leading gem-setters there is. He employs 230 people, has invested SFr50mn-SFr60mn ($56mn-$67mn) over the past 30 years, and puts the value of his company at between SFr70mn and SFr100mn. Stern is full of praise for Salanitro’s creativity. “When we talk together, we talk about creation. For example, he said we should do diamonds on dome clocks. And he’s right — it’s beautiful,” Stern says. “He also has great ideas for designing watches and has the same aesthetic as I have in terms of watches. That means that, when he creates a diamond watch, it has to be ‘aggressive’ for men and not just bling bling.” He adds with a chuckle: “The only thing with him is that he can go off like a firework. He is a very creative guy and sometimes you have to bring him down to earth.” The brand’s diamond and sapphire backgammon set © Aurélien Poncet It is to harness that excess creativity that S by Salanitro was launched. “I have so many ideas in my head, and I have wanted to do this for many years,” Salanitro says. He insists that this new venture is neither a hobby nor an indulgence, but a business fulfilling a need, albeit a rarefied one at the top of the market: the backgammon set, for example, starts at SFr70,000-SFr80,000 ($78,000-$89,000.) When Pierre creates a diamond watch, it has to be ‘aggressive’ for men and not just bling blingThierry Stern, Patek Philippe “I was convinced that there was demand when I went to Bangkok to have a meeting with a client,” Salanitro says. “They wanted unique things and were prepared to pay anything to have something different.” Commissions that have come in following the launch appear to have added further validation.  Salanitro began his working life at Swiss Bank Corporation, which became part of UBS, but it was only when he visited the gem-setting atelier belonging to the father of a friend that the former investment banker experienced a coup de foudre. “I like making things with my hands and seeing the results, especially when you are working with noble materials,” he says. He asked for a job and, for a few punishing months, worked at the jeweller’s bench for three hours in the morning before going into the bank — then returning for a further three hours of stone-setting at the end of the day. His friend’s father took him on in 1987 when demand for gem-set pieces fell, but Salanitro found himself out of work. Undaunted, he set up a workshop at home and carried out repairs for local jewellers. His break into the watch industry came, when he did some work for Piaget. “When I started working for Rolex and Patek Philippe, doors opened to me,” says Salanitro. “Because their quality standards are so high, everyone trusts you.” An S by Salanitro sculpture inspired by a Mesoamerican mask  He opened his first workshops, taking on 12 employees, in the Acacias district of Geneva, near Rolex’s headquarters. “The big brands wanted to deal with one partner and not with many different suppliers. As a result, some of the smaller businesses were using subcontractors,” he explains. Salanitro saw an opportunity to establish a one-stop-shop, offering prototyping, case fabrication, bracelet-making and polishing services with a single standard of quality, under one roof. He began acquiring smaller workshops.  “I first purchased Serti Concept, because the proprietor wanted to retire — that cost about SFr900,000 ($1mn) — then a small polishing business called Polifer, which had seven people, for about SFr300,000 ($334,000),” he recalls. Salanitro’s biggest investment was in Sertis Créations, which employed 50 staff. “They were my main competition, but they got into trouble,” he says. “It was an investment of SFr6mn ($6.7mn), but it also brought me two clients with whom I was not yet working.” In addition to Richemont, Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, Salanitro also works for LVMH. “I have a great working relationship with Alexandre, Frédéric and Jean Arnault,” he says, referring to the sons of LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault who are, respectively, executive vice-president at Tiffany & Co, Tag Heuer chief executive, and head of Louis Vuitton’s watch marketing and product development. “And I have the highest respect for Stéphane Bianchi [head of LVMH’s watch and jewellery division], who is a true gentleman,” Salanitro continues. As for Patek’s investment in the Salanitro brand, “Pierre is still in charge”, says Stern. “I didn’t buy the whole company; I just bought a certain percentage. We don’t say how much and it’s not really that huge, but it’s enough to guarantee me the capacity. The jewellery side of Patek Philippe is increasing, not only for ladies but also for men.” But, for Stern, the deal was about more than securing capacity for gem-setting. “It was a little bit like my grandfather in the old days: we just shook hands, and we knew it was done,” he says. “But it’s not only about business, it was also about friendship. We met just after we had left school.” Stern, who is four years younger than Salanitro, adds: “He grew up in his business. I grew up with Patek. We trust each other. I would say we have the same philosophy, and the same friends.”","12.05.2023"

Sign up here to get it sent straight to your inbox every Monday. Does the format, content and tone work for you? Let me know: harriet.agnew@ft.com  The diverging fortunes of Lansdowne Partners and Marshall Wace Born a year apart a quarter of a century ago, Lansdowne Partners and Marshall Wace struck out on the same path, using fundamental analysis to buy and sell European equities.  Now the London hedge funds are very different animals. Lansdowne has struggled to diversify beyond its flagship fund, hamstrung by a static ownership structure that limits incentives for new hires. Assets under management have plunged by two-thirds from a 2015 peak of $21bn and it has shifted from high-margin hedge funds to a long-only business commanding a fraction of the fees.   Marshall Wace, meanwhile, has carved out a position as Europe’s answer to US industry giants Citadel or Millennium Management. Turbocharged by an investment from private equity giant KKR eight years ago, assets under management have swelled to a record $63bn, an anomaly among the region’s equities hedge funds that have largely retrenched. And a dynamic partnership structure has ensured retiring partners make way for the next generation.

			 For this deep dive, I spoke to more than a dozen top insiders, investors and rivals about how the firms’ fortunes came to diverge in a Darwinian tale of performance, succession and strategy.  Their trajectories provide a microcosm of the hedge fund sector’s evolution from a cottage industry of boutique managers to a handful of big names running diversified, sophisticated and technologically driven businesses. They also serve as case studies on the need to keep innovating, on whether hedge funds can or should outlast their founders — and on how past performance is no guarantee of future success.   “Like a lot of fund managers, people might be clever and good at investing,” said one investor. “But they’re not always good at getting the strategy of their own firm right.”  Read the full story here  The unravelling of Odey Asset Management It has taken just a week for Odey Asset Management to unravel following the Financial Times investigation into its founder, Crispin Odey.  The investigation uncovered alleged sexual assaults spanning decades from 13 women, which Odey strenuously denies. But the fallout has been sizeable and rapid, writes Emma Dunkley in London. In the seven days following the investigation, prime brokers moved to cut ties with OAM. Morgan Stanley, Exane and Goldman Sachs were among the first movers, followed by JPMorgan, which also serves as custodian for the fund manager’s assets, and UBS. Rival fund managers with investments in Odey’s funds also reviewed their holdings, with Schroders offloading its remaining stake in the Odey Swan product. Just two days after the investigation, the partners at OAM ousted the founder and his company, Odey Asset Management Limited, as members of the firm. Management of Odey’s funds were also handed to other partners, including James Hanbury. As investors withdrew their money, OAM had little choice but to halt redemption requests. The firm also decided to close the Swan fund, which managed €117mn. Other funds that were suspended include the Brook Developed Markets, LF Odey Portfolio and Brook Absolute Return. OAM is now being broken up. It said on Thursday it was in “advanced discussions” about rehousing funds and managers with rival fund groups — although the names of groups involved in the talks have yet to emerge.  The Financial Conduct Authority has also become embroiled in the scandal. MPs have written to the watchdog demanding to know what action it took after receiving a report from OAM detailing inappropriate behaviour by the founder.  In this explainer, we consider what lies ahead for the hedge fund in the wake of sexual assault claims against its founder. Read all about Odey’s fall from grace in this deep dive: The week the City ditched Crispin Odey. Then as columnist Helen Thomas points out in this opinion piece, when it comes to harassment, the City must stop protecting its wallet. And deputy editor Patrick Jenkins argues that Odey’s collapse is only partial justice: the founder of the firm is still walking away with the spoils of an investing career made while allegedly abusing employees along the way. Chart of the week  The S&P 500 index, which measures the performance of US blue-chip stocks and sets the tone for investors around the world, is on track for one of its best half-years in two decades. But this is a rally standing on top of some very slender stilts, write my colleagues Katie Martin and Nicholas Megaw in this Big Read. Strip out just a tiny clutch of companies, all tech heavy hitters, and the index is going nowhere. “Typically with things like this, when only a small number of stocks are doing well, you get overvaluation and speculative behaviour — everyone pumps money into these stocks, and we have another tech bubble like we did in the late 90s and early 2000s,” says Remi Olu-Pitan, multi-asset portfolio manager at Schroders. “You can argue that maybe we’re sowing the seeds of that.” Top-heaviness, particularly in US markets, is not new — think of the oil companies in the past, or the so-called Nifty 50 stocks in the 1960s. But by many measures, it has now reached striking extremes, masking a humdrum performance from the vast majority of stocks and complicating investment decisions both for those who pick stocks and those who prefer to track indices.  Some warn it is unsustainable or a sign of treacherous market conditions ahead. The performance of the S&P 500 index is now the most concentrated it has been since the 1970s. Seven of the biggest constituents — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — have ripped higher, gaining between 40 per cent and 180 per cent this year. The remaining 493 companies are, in aggregate, flat. Meanwhile in Europe, strategists at Goldman Sachs have termed 11 stocks with strong balance sheets that are driving the markets as ‘GRANOLAS’: GSK, Roche, ASML, Nestlé, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L’Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP, Sanofi. Read the full story here Five unmissable stories this week BlackRock founder Larry Fink has predicted “transformative opportunities” in artificial intelligence could solve the productivity crisis he blames for persistently high inflation. Meanwhile the world’s largest asset manager pushed further into cryptocurrencies by filing an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund. Billionaire investor Ken Griffin, founder of US hedge fund Citadel, said China could prop up the global economy this year, helping avert an “ugly” slowdown in growth if the US suffers a recession. Calpers, the biggest public pension scheme in the US, is planning a multibillion-dollar push into international venture capital as the $442bn fund tilts towards riskier asset classes in a hunt for higher returns after a “lost decade”. FTSE 100 insurer Legal & General has appointed António Simões as its new chief executive to replace Sir Nigel Wilson, who is retiring after more than a decade in the job. Simões joins from Spain’s Santander, where he has been regional head of Europe since 2020. Fidelity International is expanding into European business lending as asset managers seek to exploit gaps in the market after rule changes since the financial crisis and the recent banking turmoil. It is launching a fund that will make secured loans to midsized European corporates with annual earnings of around €5mn to €30mn. And finally  The National Portrait Gallery is reopening this week following a major transformation project. To celebrate this, the enchanting Daniel Katz Gallery has put together a feast of portraiture its Mayfair premises, including works by artists already held in the National Portrait Galleries collection.

"How to be a better leader in the new workplace","Research tells us what works — and what doesn’t — in terms of engaging staff, at home and in person ","Grace Lordan is author of ‘Think Big’, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and founding director of The Inclusion Initiative  The evolution of the role of the office in the future of work is still a hot topic — and rightly so. We are seeing a gradual reimagining of where, when and how we work. My research as a behavioural scientist has found much of that shift is being driven by employees. Research I published on behalf of Women in Banking & Finance, an organisation for financial services professionals, shows some City staff are ignoring leaders’ orders to come into the office on a set number of days per week. They are instead focusing on a “remote first” approach, working in the office when it is beneficial to them, in terms of productivity and in meeting the company’s operational needs.  This study was conducted by my team at the London School of Economics in The Inclusion Initiative, a unit that uses data and evidence-based research to show what works (and what does not) to make workplaces more inclusive and promote gender equality. We interviewed 100 staff members at different seniority levels in financial services companies, 70 of whom were women. Employers included Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schroders and UBS.  We then came up with a wider blueprint that offered a vision for the future of work in the financial services sector that was effective, inclusive, and applicable for other organisations and sectors. We called it, optimistically, the Utopia Framework.  We approached the research with open minds and allowed the respondents to discuss the future of work without input from ourselves.  The majority of respondents spoke of the importance of reducing stress and illness in the sector, with a focus on making sure managers and HR departments dealt promptly and empathetically with problems of isolation, bullying and burnout. Strikingly, no one mentioned it was employers’ responsibility to improve staff happiness at work.  Our interviewees repeatedly pointed to the importance of prioritising psychological safety. This meant building a work culture where employees felt secure and had the freedom to bring their own perspectives. This can be challenging for leaders — sometimes staff tell them what they don’t want to hear — but it is particularly beneficial for roles that require risk assessment or innovation, where having diverse teams that can be honest allows for better outcomes.  Interviewees said functions and teams should define locally when they should be in the office in terms of satisfying operations, and maximising productivity We were surprised by how much attention our interviewees gave to the role of flexible work in their post-pandemic lives. It has surfaced as a critical matter for leaders and managers to get right.  Many managers we spoke to articulated a view of “what’s the point of showing up at the office for the sake of it?” “Sometimes I’m told: ‘You really should be in on this Thursday or it will look bad,’ and actually I didn’t want to be in on this Thursday because I’ve got just Zooms,” said one interviewee. We did not find coercion or sanctions being applied to get people back to the office. More common were positive incentives to draw people to the office. Offers ranged from talks by big-name inspirational speakers, to social events and free food. Our wider research suggests mandating fixed days in the office is already outdated and is not going to get the best from a workforce, especially in organisations where improving all measures of diversity and inclusion is a priority.  Our research found near-unanimous agreement that there was no “one size fits all” when it came to optimal working, and that functions and teams should define locally when they should be in the office. One interviewee in a senior management role said: “We get a lot more from our people when they feel trusted to make their own decisions . . . we used to hear people saying, ‘I had to throw [the kids] at the nanny and get into the office for 9am.’ One of the things I’m always saying to people is, ‘I’d rather have you here for six hours where you’re really productive than for ten hours when you’re really stressed.’” How much productivity are leaders losing by forcing employees to bend their optimal working style to match what employers are demanding? Unless you are on an assembly line, the amount of time you work hasn’t been shown to link to your outputs. And this is the key point for the financial services sector. A focus on output over hours will mean colleagues see the point of being in the office on the days they are asked versus working autonomously. Some leaders may worry that employees will take advantage of remote work and will not perform well. Reassuringly, there is good evidence that when employees are allowed to work with heightened autonomy, it improves engagement without compromising performance.  There is also evidence that giving flexibility increases trust and psychological safety from team members towards their manager. Overall, financial and professional companies that value productivity should choose a future of work that blends autonomous working and being on-site in a way that maximises their organisation’s productivity and operational needs.  Taking this approach will allow companies to recruit, promote and retain more diverse pools of talented people, since those with parenting and caring responsibilities, as well as those with disabilities, particularly benefit from flexible working patterns. Six leadership goals for 20231. Trust your team: Let go of wanting to know what your team is doing every second. Have an open-door policy for colleagues to bring problems and mistakes to you. Otherwise, let them get on with their jobs. 2. Have clear rules of engagement: Successful “remote first working” rules might include virtual huddles, deep-dive lengthy team strategy meetings and expectations around when the entire team needs to be on-site. 3. Define and quantify output: Measure added value or productivity rather than hours worked. Delineate what employees are expected to produce within a given timeframe. Employ feedback to better define output per work week. 4. Use storytelling to define the ‘why’ to your team members: Make sure every team member is connected to the overall purpose of the team’s mission to encourage high performance. 5. Leave no one behind: Give every person in your team equal opportunities, visibility and voice. 6. Manage poor performance: One of the easiest ways to lower the performance in your team is to let a colleague who isn’t adding value go unchecked. Deal with their performance issues in a timely manner.","11.04.2023"
"Investors pile into bonds","Plus, the UK’s pension reforms, semiconductors surge, and al-Azzawi at the Ashmolean museum","Hello, I’m Emma Dunkley covering for Harriet Agnew this week.  Investors are piling back into bonds following a “cataclysmic” period for the asset class.  Bond prices tumbled last year after steep increases in US interest rates. But yields on Treasury notes are now higher than they have been for most of the past decade, providing an attractive income for asset managers.  With the Federal Reserve nearing the end of its tightening cycle, institutional and retail investors are heading back into fixed income, as Madison Derbyshire and Harriet Agnew report. T Rowe Price, which oversees more than $1tn in assets, said bonds are finally “exciting again, for the first time in a long time”. Sebastien Page, chief investment officer of T Rowe Price global multi-asset strategy, said: “It’s very simple — yields are much higher than they were and it just means you have higher expected returns.” More than $100bn has poured into actively managed fixed income funds in the US during the first four months of this year, according to data site Morningstar. This follows outflows of more than $332bn last year. Investors say the rotation back into bonds is sizeable. “We’re seeing enormous moves into fixed income,” said Yie-Hsin Hung, the chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. “It feels like the beginning stages of what happened in equities, moving much more into passive.” It is not just US investors who are returning to the asset class. In the UK, retail investors have also flocked to gilts and fixed income products, according to execution-only platform AJ Bell.  Michael Summersgill, chief executive of the investment site, said that customers on the platform had increased their investments in UK government bonds by a “meaningful” amount. “I’ve been here for 16 years, I have not seen gilts and fixed-income products being bought with anything like the volume that we’ve seen,” he said. UK government bond yields, which move inversely to prices, rose on Wednesday to the highest level since former prime minister Liz Truss’s “mini” Budget, after inflation was higher than expected. Gilt yields jumped again on Thursday, as traders bet interest rates would peak at 5.5 per cent by the end of the year. UK plans pension changes to boost business Pension fund reform is on the cards in the UK, as the government attempts to unlock billions of pounds to support domestic businesses. Ministers are considering plans to reform the government-backed Pension Protection Fund so that it can take on struggling companies’ defined benefit pension plans, in addition to schemes where the employer fails. The aim of the proposals, which are being examined by chancellor Jeremy Hunt, is to free-up billions of pounds held in defined benefit schemes which can be funnelled into UK start-ups and fast-growing businesses.   Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP, said if struggling schemes could be moved to the PPF without failing first, it could lead to “tens of billions of assets” being transferred. As Josephine Cumbo, George Parker, and Chris Flood report, the initiative is one of a range being considered by the government to support investment into UK businesses. Pension reform has come under the spotlight as research by Ondra Partners shows holdings of UK-listed companies by British pension and insurance funds have plunged from about half of their portfolios to 4 per cent over the past two decades. The Tony Blair Institute, a think-tank, has suggested pooling thousands of public and private sector pension plans into giant “GB superfunds” of up to £500bn in size, as another way to unleash billions of pounds for UK business growth. The proposals come as a string of companies have shunned the London Stock Exchange in favour of New York, owing to a range of factors, from potentially higher valuations in the US to bigger executive pay packets. Analysis by Patrick Mathurin and Anne-Sylvaine Chassany shows London is the European stock exchange most at risk of losing large listings to the US.  The FT examined 111 European companies, each with a market capitalisation of at least $10bn and each with their shares trading at a discount to US rivals, to see which groups have the strongest case for shifting to New York. London-listed groups represented half of the top 10 and 18 of the top 50. London-listed Irish construction group CRH, which will put its decision to move its primary listing to New York to shareholders on June 8, tops the league table. It is followed by cigarette maker British American Tobacco and drugmaker GSK. Dutch medical devices group Philips ranks fifth. Chart of the week  Shares in the world’s largest semiconductor makers surged after Nvidia’s bumper earnings. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index this week rose to its highest level in 14 months, writes George Steer in London.  Nvidia’s market value soared by more than $184bn this week to near $1tn after it projected $11bn worth of sales over the next three months, nearly $4bn ahead of consensus expectations. “This is the largest raise we have seen in our coverage”, said analysts at Bank of America. Companies such as AMD, Marvell Technology and Applied Materials have also soared this year, up around 95 per cent, 70 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. “Nvidia is the clear leader, but two-thirds of [the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s] components are outperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date and more than a third are up triple the rate of the S&P 500,” noted analysts at Bespoke Investment Group in New York. Across various industries there is “unsatiated demand” for Nvidia’s latest H100 data centre chips, said Abhinav Davuluri, equity strategist at Morningstar.  However, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, warned that the rally in AI-related companies in particular “has raised concerns that this segment is now in a bubble.”  Five unmissable stories this week Pete Briger, co-founder of Fortress Investment Group, believes that a sharp credit contraction caused by the banking crisis and rising interest rates will fuel a wave of defaults. This will create the best opportunity for distressed asset investors since 2008, he said. Kensington and Chelsea council’s pension fund is pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into commercial property in a controversial bet just as many global retirement funds offload or write down their real estate holdings.  GAM’s senior fund managers made a rare intervention by publicly supporting the proposed sale of the Swiss group to UK-listed Liontrust. In an open letter to GAM’s board, fund managers at the Swiss company said that there was a “cultural alignment between GAM and Liontrust”.  Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK’s largest execution-only investment site, sounded the alarm over Lindsell Train’s risk management. Hargreaves warned that the fund group was not “sufficiently” assessing its investment decisions and found shortcomings in the “capabilities and resource”. Investment advisers are job-hopping in the US, sparked by a series of mergers and the recent banking turmoil. More than 26,000 advisers switched firms in 2022, according to Cerulli Associates, representing 9.2 per cent of the US total. Industry executives say they expect the number to grow this year.

"Chocolatiers: seeking a sweet spot to balance demand and prices ","Demand elasticity for sweet treats shows how inflation is hitting disposable incomes","It is Easter weekend and chocolate is on the menu. Most of us have a favourite: Cadbury, Hershey or Lindt to name a few. The Belgian-Swiss Barry Callebaut is unlikely to be on the list even though its chocolate is found in treats such as Unilever’s Magnum ice creams.  The reason is that Barry Callebaut is the world’s largest business-to-business chocolatier, a status that limits brand recognition. This week it told investors that hot inflation is continuing to soften sales volumes. That appears to conflict with the widely-held idea that demand for chocolate is inelastic. Elasticity of demand — or the lack of it — is an important concept in investment. In theory, a rationally greedy business would increase prices as long as demand stayed high. This usually applies to chocolate. It is hard to substitute with other foods. It triggers human pleasure responses in unique ways. People buy it as a treat even if they are economising on ordinary groceries.  Barry Callebaut delivered over 1mn tons of chocolate and ingredients in the six months to February, 3 per cent less than last year. Shutdowns at its Wieze plant in Belgium, the largest chocolate factory in the world, were partly responsible.  The problem is that cocoa prices are soaring and are now close to five-year highs. The corresponding increase in retail chocolate prices has been sharp enough to crimp normally inelastic consumer demand. At the same time, food manufacturers have cut proportions of chocolate as an ingredient in their wares.  Even though the company expects full year volumes to be flat, shareholders have a few reasons to stay sweet. Sales in Swiss francs rose almost 4 per cent year on year and recurring operating profits were up 10 per cent. A strategy to move upmarket, put in place by Peter Boone who recently departed as chief executive, should continue to drive profit growth.  “Innovations like vegan and ruby chocolate are helping drive a higher margin mix that should translate into sustainably higher profits at Barry Callebaut,” says Alex Sloane, an analyst at Barclays.  Discerning chocolate lovers — and investors — might prefer Swiss peer Lindt & Sprüngli. Shares in the famous chocolate brand trade at a pricey 40 times multiple of forward earnings, about twice that of Barry Callebaut. Lindt grew volumes by 2.6 per cent last year, slower than the 7 per cent it managed in 2021. The company managed to offset lower volume growth with higher prices and more profitable sales; operating margins of 15 per cent were the highest on record.   Demand elasticity for sweet treats shows quite how hard inflation is hitting disposable incomes. Researchers at UBS found that consumers are less willing to pay steep prices for chocolate. Global inflation has yet to show signs of a sustained slowdown. That is bad news for chocolate producers. It is becoming harder for them to pass on high input prices. Chocolate sales this weekend may be a little subdued relative to other years, despite the sugar rush engendered by the product. Rathbones/Investec: call of duty Managing money in the UK is tougher than ever. Markets are weak. Fees are low. Businesses are subscale. All three drivers are reflected in the latest wealth management tie-up. Rathbones is bringing Investec’s UK wealth business into its fold.  Lex’s broad view is that fund managers — of which wealth managers are a subset — need to go big, go specialist or go home. Traditional stock pickers are under heavy pressure from passive giants.  The combination of Rathbones and Investec looks defensive in this context. Competition is just one side of the coin.  A “consumer duty” imposed on UK financial businesses this July may be a further reason for an all-share deal valuing the Investec unit at £839mn. The new duty will be avowedly “outcomes based”. For a discretionary manager such as Rathbones, that may sound ominously retrospective. Investments do not always work out as advisers and clients hope.   Critics fear the consumer duty will spur litigation and dent City competitiveness. The new rules will also boost rapidly developing passive investment managers.  Greater scale should be some help to Rathbones. Combined funds under management of £100bn remain small compared with the client assets of passive giants such as BlackRock and Amundi. But the figure is roughly double assets at Brewin Dolphin, which was acquired by Royal Bank of Canada for £1.6bn this time last year.  The deal will leave Investec shareholders with a 41.3 per cent economic stake and 29.9 per cent of the votes in the combined business. Rathbones is paying a price equivalent to 2.1 per cent of Investec’s assets under management (AUM). That is a third below some comparable deals, notably RBC’s purchase of Brewin Dolphin and Rathbones’ acquisition of Saunderson House in 2021. On a standalone basis, Rathbones’ shares trade at about 1.9 per cent of AUM. The stock has fallen about 10 per cent since the start of 2020. That reflects tough operating conditions and rising IT investment. The latter shaved almost 4 percentage points from operating margins that last year hit a multi-decade low of 21.3 per cent.  Margins were expected to bounce back to the high 20s by 2024. The new consumer duty may make that target harder to hit. Much depends on whether politicians support rigorous enforcement.

"Investors pour record sums into high-grade corporate bonds","Higher yields and worries about riskier debt fuel stampede into investment-grade market","Investors are piling into high-quality corporate bonds this year at a record rate, reflecting their enthusiasm for an asset class that is typically seen as relatively low risk but now offers the best returns in years. A total of $19bn has poured into funds which buy investment grade corporate debt around the world since the start of 2023, the most ever at this point in the year, according to data from fund flow tracker EPFR. The cash flooding into the asset class underlines investors’ eagerness to lock in historically high yields provided by the safest corporate debt after a bruising sell-off last year, and the fact that they no longer need to push into riskier corners of the credit market in search of decent returns.  “People basically think that fixed income in general looks a lot more attractive than it has in prior years,” according to Matt Mish, head of credit strategy at UBS. “The euphoria around investment grade is basically more broadly this euphoria around yields,” he added. “At least relative to last year and really relative to most of the last decade, [high-grade corporate debt] is offering yields that are considerably higher.” Average US investment grade yields have climbed to 5.45 per cent from 3.1 per cent a year ago, having late last year touched their highest level since 2009. The bulk of that rise reflected a broad fixed income sell-off over the past year as the Federal Reserve — like other big central banks — rapidly lifted interest rates in a bid to snuff out sky-high inflation. Yields have also leapt on more speculative junk-rated debt, but many fund managers say they prefer to stick with debt issued by companies better-placed to weather a potential economic downturn as higher interest rates slow the economy. “Clients are looking at investment-grade first,” said Christian Hantel, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. “They are pretty cautious after having their fingers burnt last year.” “They like to allocate to more risky assets but they are not ready to go all-in,” he added.   The current environment means “we don’t need to challenge ourselves in liquidity or on credit quality” according to Henrietta Pacquement, head of global fixed income at Allspring Global Investments.  Conditions so far this year have created a window for companies to launch a borrowing spree, with more than $182bn in proceeds from US investment-grade deals alone, according to data from Refinitiv. Just this week, pharmaceuticals giant Amgen tapped the market with a $24bn sale to fund the buyout of Horizon Therapeutics. By comparison, December US investment-grade issuance stood at just under $7bn — with the number of new deals sliding by a third in the second half of the year. In Europe, high-grade issuance has reached $246bn so far in 2023 — the best start to the year since 2012. Still, a recent run of strong economic data in the US, along with signs that inflation is still stubbornly high, could stifle the recent enthusiasm as investors brace for further tightening from the Fed. UBS’s Mish said the widespread assumption that bond markets had hit “peak yields” has been challenged in recent days. Futures markets are now reflecting bets of fewer than one US interest rate cut in 2023, having previously predicted that the Fed would lower borrowing costs twice by December after a peak in the summer. Goldman Sachs has already turned “slightly bearish on high-quality US corporate bonds,” analysts at the bank wrote this week, pointing to the “re-emergence of cash as a competing and rewarding alternative.”   “The easy money has already been made,” said chief credit strategist Lotfi Karoui.

"Credit Suisse shares rally after $54bn lifeline from Swiss central bank","Troubled lender taps emergency funding following sell-off that shook global financial sector","Credit Suisse shares rebounded sharply on Thursday after the lender revealed plans to borrow up to SFr50bn ($54bn) from the Swiss central bank and buy back about SFr3bn of its debt in an attempt to boost liquidity and calm investors. The Swiss National Bank had said on Wednesday it was willing to provide a liquidity backstop following a plunge of as much as 30 per cent in the troubled lender’s stock. That sell-off came after the chair of Saudi National Bank, a major Credit Suisse shareholder, ruled out any further investment. It also followed turbulent trade in global banking stocks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse.  In a statement on Thursday, Credit Suisse said it had taken the decision “to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity” by borrowing the funds from the Swiss central bank under a loan facility and short-term liquidity facility. Credit Suisse shares opened up more than 20 per cent in Zurich, although they had given up some of those gains by the early afternoon and were 17 per cent higher.  The bank plans to make a cash tender offer for 10 US dollar-denominated senior debt securities worth up to $2.5bn and four euro-denominated senior debt securities worth up to €500mn. The offers will expire on March 22. Chief executive Ulrich Körner said the measures “demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation”. Körner’s restructuring has included selling off a part of Credit Suisse’s investment bank and cutting thousands of jobs. “My team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,” added Körner, who was appointed chief executive in July. Yields on the bank’s bonds dropped slightly on the news, while spreads on its five-year credit default swaps — which indicate investor bearishness — fell from 980 basis points to 898 bps, having started the month at 350 bps.   Credit Suisse’s dollar bond due in 2027 gave up early gains to fall by about 8c to 64 cents on the dollar. It had traded at around 78 cents on Tuesday, before the latest crisis erupted. UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he and Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey were following the situation “very closely”. “The news we’ve heard from the Swiss authorities this morning is encouraging,” he told Sky News. RBC analyst Anke Reingen said Credit Suisse’s stronger liquidity position along with the backstop provided by the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority would help the bank regain trust from its investors. The “measures taken should provide some comfort that a spillover to the sector could be contained, but the situation remains uncertain”, she added. Analysts at JPMorgan said the latest developments at the scandal-plagued Credit Suisse meant the “status quo was no longer an option”. “We see a resolution scenario as most unlikely in our view and more likely an intervention with the . . . option of a takeover as the most likely scenario especially by UBS,” wrote Kian Abouhossein.   The move is the latest attempt by Credit Suisse to regain investor confidence after a series of scandals and setbacks rocked the Swiss bank and pushed its stock price to a record low. Credit Suisse shares closed down 24.2 per cent on Wednesday, pushing its market value below SFr7bn. Shares in the bank, which raised SFr4bn of capital just a few months ago, are down 39 per cent this year and 85 per cent over the past two years. Wednesday’s sell-off came as banks in Europe and the US were still reeling from the closure of SVB, the biggest US bank failure since 2008. Its implosion came after long-dated Treasury bonds it had invested in collapsed in value. Investors said Credit Suisse’s problems were a reminder that Europe’s banks also had large bond portfolios, the paper value of which has been hammered by rising interest rates. For Credit Suisse, the share price drop added to what has already been a challenging week. On Tuesday, the bank revealed that its auditor, PwC, had identified “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls, leading to the delay of the publication of its annual report. On Wednesday, Saudi National Bank chair Ammar Alkhudairy said “the answer is absolutely not” when asked if SNB would be open to providing capital to Credit Suisse. SNB bought a 10 per cent stake in Credit Suisse last year. He said owning a large share of the bank would result in unwanted regulatory requirements, though he added he supported Credit Suisse’s restructuring plan and did not think it needed more capital.

"Generative AI is sowing the seeds of doubt in serious science","Researchers have already developed a bot that could help tell the difference between synthetic and human-generated text","The writer is a science commentator Large language models like ChatGPT are purveyors of plausibility. The chatbots, many based on so-called generative AI, are trained to respond to user questions by scraping the internet for relevant information and assembling coherent answers, churning out convincing student essays, authoritative legal documents and believable news stories.  But, because publicly available data contains misinformation and disinformation, some machine-generated texts might not be accurate or true. That has triggered a scramble to develop tools to identify whether text has been drafted by human or machine. Science is also struggling to adjust to this new era, with live discussions over whether chatbots should be allowed to write scientific papers or even generate new hypotheses.   The importance of distinguishing artificial from human intelligence is growing by the day. This month, UBS analysts revealed ChatGPT was the fastest-growing web app in history, garnering 100mn monthly active users in January. Some sectors have decided there is no point bolting the stable door: on Monday, the International Baccalaureate said pupils would be allowed to use ChatGPT to write essays, provided they referenced it.   In fairness, the tech’s creator is upfront about its limitations. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, warned in December that ChatGPT was “good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness . . . we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.” The company is developing a cryptographic watermark for its output, a secret machine-readable sequence of punctuation, spellings and word order; and is honing a “classifier” to tell the difference between synthetic and human-generated text, using examples of both to train it.  Eric Mitchell, a graduate student at Stanford University, figured a classifier would take a lot of training data. Along with colleagues, he came up with DetectGPT, a “zero-shot” approach to spotting the difference, meaning the method requires no prior learning. Instead, the method turns a chatbot on itself, to sniff out its own output.  It works like this: DetectGPT asks a chatbot how much it “likes” a sample text, with the “liking” a shorthand for how similar the sample is to its own creations. DetectGPT then goes one step further — it “perturbs” the text, slightly altering the wording. The assumption is that a chatbot is more variable in its “likes” of altered human-generated text than altered machine text. In early tests, the researchers claim, the method correctly distinguished between human and machine authorship 95 per cent of the time.  There are caveats: the results are not yet peer-reviewed; the method, while better than random guessing, did not work equally reliably across all generative AI models. DetectGPT could be fooled by making human tweaks to synthetic text. What does all this mean for science? Scientific publishing is the lifeblood of research, injecting ideas, hypotheses, arguments and evidence into the global scientific canon. Some have been quick to alight on ChatGPT as a research assistant, with a handful of papers controversially listing the AI as a co-author.   Meta even launched a science-specific text generator called Galactica. It was withdrawn three days later. Among the howlers it produced was a fictitious history of bears travelling in space.  Professor Michael Black of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen tweeted at the time that he was “troubled” by Galactica’s answers to multiple inquiries about his own research field, including attributing bogus papers to real researchers. “In all cases, [Galactica] was wrong or biased but sounded right and authoritative. I think it’s dangerous.”  The peril comes from plausible text slipping into real scientific submissions, peppering the literature with fake citations and forever distorting the canon. The journal Science now bans generated text outright; Nature permits its use if declared but forbids crediting it as co-author.   Then again, most people don’t consult high-end journals to guide their scientific thinking. Should the devious be so inclined, these chatbots can spew an on-demand stream of citation-heavy pseudoscience on why vaccination doesn’t work, or why global warming is a hoax. That misleading material, posted online, can then be swallowed by future generative AI to produce a new iteration of falsehoods that further pollutes public discourse.  The merchants of doubt must be rubbing their hands.","01.03.2023"
"JPMorgan’s Dimon and BlackRock’s Fink warn of ‘higher for longer’ rates","Prominent Wall Street executives at odds with market pricing suggesting Fed will cut this year","Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink have warned investors to brace for the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for a longer period of time, bucking the view that the central bank will cut rates later in 2023. The comments from two of Wall Street’s most prominent executives made the case that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and broader struggles among regional US banks will not be enough to deter the Fed from keeping rates elevated in its battle to curb inflation. Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, on Friday said there could be consequences for investors and companies which do not prepare for the risk of an extended period of tighter monetary policy.   “They saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people’s expectations. You had the gilt problem in London,” Dimon told analysts on Friday during a call to discuss his bank’s first-quarter results. He was referring to the sell-off of UK government debt last year following a botched budget.  “You had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer,” he added.  Separately, BlackRock CEO Fink said in an interview this week: “Inflation is going to be stickier for longer so the Fed may need to continue to increase 50 or 75 basis points more . . . There’s a lot of stress in the market.”  Results from JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, as well as Citigroup and Wells Fargo, underscored how the largest lenders are benefiting from higher interest rates by charging more for loans without passing on significantly higher savings rates for depositors. But higher rates for longer could prolong the pain for some of the US regional banks, including many due to report earnings next week. They have come under pressure following SVB’s collapse as investors focus on their holdings of long-dated US Treasuries and the loans they made when interest rates were lower. These assets are now worth less because the Fed rapidly lifted rates over the past 12 months. After three banks failed in a week last month, some customers have pulled money from smaller banks over fears that they may struggle to honour deposits if they have to sell these assets at a loss. If the Fed starts cutting rates, some of those paper losses could be clawed back before assets have to be sold.  The regional banks reporting next week include Comerica, Western Alliance and Zions Bank, all of which had their share prices fall sharply during the turmoil in March. At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed raised its benchmark policy rate by a quarter-point to 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent. Several Fed officials considered forgoing a rate rise because of the recent stresses in the banking system, which also included Credit Suisse being taken over by local rival UBS.  Markets have for months bet that the Fed will be forced to pump the brakes far sooner than the central bank expects. In the futures market, traders are currently betting the Fed will cut rates to 4.5 per cent by year-end. That implies two rate cuts in the latter half of this year if the central bank raises again in May as expected. For Wall Street financiers, the key concern is that higher rates for longer, and the stresses at regional banks that lend to many small and local businesses, will constrain lending and do further damage the US economy. Dimon said there will be “a little bit of tightening” but that he “wouldn’t use the word credit crunch” to describe what will happen to bank lending.  “I just look at that as a kind of a thumb on the scale . . . the financial conditions will be a little bit tighter,” Dimon said. Despite his warnings, the current consensus for a rate cut later this year led JPMorgan to increase its outlook for earnings from lending, known as net interest income, by almost 10 per cent to about $81bn for 2023.   JPMorgan’s rosier forecast is predicated on the fact that a rate cut would reduce the need for it to lift rates for depositors in order to stop them transferring cash to higher-yielding products such as money market funds. Dimon’s personal view of the trajectory of inflation is in effect at odds with the bank’s forecast, which is based on market pricing. First-quarter results from the banks on Friday underscored the underlying strength of the US economy and provided another data point that might mean the Fed does not need to lower rates this year.  Citi said its credit card customers spent 7 per cent more in the first three months of 2023 than they did in the first three months of last year. The bank’s fees from corporate transactions increased 13 per cent from the year-ago period as well, suggesting a continued increase in economic activity. Wells Fargo also reported a continued increase in consumer spending in its credit card business. Not all Wall Street executives are predicting the Fed will hold firm on rates. Citi chief financial officer Mark Mason told analysts the bank is expecting rates to “flatten” after the second quarter and then trend down towards the end of 2023 to about 4.5 per cent. Wells CFO Michael Santomassimo said on the bank’s earnings call that, while markets are currently pricing in an interest-rate cut later this year, “I do think that you need to be prepared that that’s not going to happen.

"Can Morgan Stanley pull off a bloodless succession?","Longtime chief executive seeks to buck ‘horrific’ Wall Street record for handing over top jobs","Over an Italian dinner at Elio’s on New York’s Upper East Side two years ago, Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein promised each other that a brewing succession battle at Morgan Stanley would not devolve into the kind of back-stabbing common at other banks. Colleagues for 15 years, they had just been promoted to co-presidents, marking them out as leading contenders to eventually take over one of Wall Street’s biggest jobs from long-serving chief executive James Gorman. They knew a good relationship was important to their boss — Gorman had warned privately that internal politicking was one sure-fire way to disqualify a candidate from the CEO job.   And now, after Gorman announced last week that he planned to step down within 12 months, their fraternity will be put to the test as Morgan Stanley’s board tries to pull off a Wall Street rarity: a bloodless succession.  “[Gorman] mentions it all the time that Wall Street has been absolutely horrific on succession and that he was the one who was going to change that,” said one former Morgan Stanley executive.  Gorman, 64, said at Morgan Stanley’s annual meeting that the bank’s board of directors had identified “three very strong senior internal candidates for consideration as the next CEO”, referring to Pick, Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz, another top executive.  “In terms of who takes over, I don’t envy who has to make that decision,” said Christian Bolu, banking analyst at Autonomous Research. “What you don’t want is for the other person to leave. That would be bad for the stock.”  The three candidates have been at pains to show the world that any ambitions to be chief executive will not spill over into their work. They meet clients together. Pick, Saperstein and Simkowitz have also interviewed each other at corporate events.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment.   Wall Street history is littered with bitter succession battles, including at Goldman Sachs where David Solomon won out over co-president Harvey Schwartz to take over from Lloyd Blankfein in 2018.  Two decades ago, Morgan Stanley was roiled by infighting during the turbulent leadership of Philip Purcell. And early on in Gorman’s tenure as chief, Paul Taubman left the bank following a fractious relationship with his internal rival Colm Kelleher. Taubman now runs boutique investment bank PJT Partners while Kelleher is chair at Swiss lender UBS.  Gorman has been focused on a smooth leadership transition since he got the job in 2010. Just three weeks into his tenure he presented a succession plan to the board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter.  Whoever wins will face the daunting task of taking over from a widely praised and well-liked leader in Gorman, whose strategy to grow in wealth and asset management has been cheered by investors. Morgan Stanley is now worth more than Goldman, its perennial rival in investment banking and trading.   “Filling the shoes of James is hard because he’s done so well. He nailed strategy and execution,” said one executive who has worked with all three candidates.  In his remarks last week, Gorman left some wriggle room around his plans, telling shareholders that his succession would happen so long as economic conditions remained stable. He plans to stay on as executive chair for a period of time after handing over his responsibilities.   Pick, Saperstein and Simkowitz all have a chance of taking over, but Pick is considered the frontrunner, according to people familiar with the succession process.  In addition to their co-president titles, Pick is head of Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities division, which houses the investment bank and trading operations, while Saperstein leads wealth management. Simkowitz runs the investment management division and is co-head of strategy along with Pick.  Pick, 54, and Saperstein, 56, oversee operations that last year generated 90 per cent of Morgan Stanley’s $53.7bn in revenues.  Ted Pick  After graduating from Middlebury College and gaining an MBA from Harvard Business School, Pick started at Morgan Stanley in 1990 as a capital markets investment banker. He moved over to Morgan Stanley’s trading business where he engineered a turnround of the fixed-income division.  “The decision to reduce costs and staffing in fixed income . . . and then to see it prosper is a feather in anyone’s cap,” said one person with knowledge of the succession planning.  Pick benefits from his experience running trading and investment banking, the riskiest parts of the bank, which can generate enormous losses when managed poorly. He is viewed as having done a solid job but his record is not without blemishes — Morgan Stanley lost $911mn during the collapse of Archegos, a family office.  In investment banking, Morgan Stanley has struggled to break JPMorgan Chase and Goldman’s stranglehold as the top fee-earning firms. Pick’s old capital markets team is also at the centre of a US government investigation into its block trading business. The bank said this month it was in talks about settling the case. Andy Saperstein  Saperstein, who still speaks with the distinctive accent of the Staten Island borough of New York City, has the background most similar to Gorman’s.  After graduating with degrees from Harvard Law School and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Gorman and Saperstein worked together at McKinsey, the consultancy.  Saperstein followed Gorman first to Merrill Lynch and again to Morgan Stanley in 2006, where he became head of US wealth management in 2009.  While he still has only limited experience in Morgan Stanley’s trading business, his assured running of wealth management has pushed him into contention. He has helmed the overall wealth management division since 2019 and it has become a critical driver for Morgan Stanley’s stock, responsible for about 45 per cent of revenues with $4.5tn in client assets.  Although Saperstein was “much closer to James”, Pick had built up his relationship with Gorman in recent years, according to another executive who has worked with all three of the men.  Dan Simkowitz  Simkowitz, 58, started at Morgan Stanley in 1990, the same year as Pick, and is seen by some as the most polished candidate of the three.  “He’s somebody I can see in front of a congressional hearing,” said another person who had worked with all three men.  He joined the bank after graduating from Harvard and gaining an MBA from Columbia University. Like Pick, he has a capital markets background and also worked with the US Treasury and Federal Reserve in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He had a stint in Asia before returning to New York.    “James obviously rates his intellect very highly, he was a very good capital markets banker,” said one former colleague.  Simkowitz runs the smallest of Morgan Stanley’s three businesses — investment management makes up about 10 per cent of the bank’s revenues — but the bank’s recent purchase of Eaton Vance has given him a further opportunity to impress.  No matter which of the three does get the job, one glaring issue with Morgan Stanley’s otherwise orderly succession process will remain: the all-male line-up. The initial slate of four leading candidates, which included Morgan Stanley veteran Jonathan Pruzan before his departure earlier this year, was referred to internally as the “four horsemen”.  With up-and-coming female executives such as chief financial officer Sharon Yeshaya and Emea head Clare Woodman, it will be up to whoever takes over from Gorman to ensure that the next succession race is more diverse. ","25.05.2023"
"Thirty AI-generated imaginings of what banks might look like","¯\_(ツ)_/¯","In these circumstances it’s best to be upfront. This is a stupid post. Keep reading only if you’re fine with that. What happened was that one afternoon, while half-listening to an earnings call, we began feeding bank names at random into an AI image generator. Nothing newsworthy came out of the call so rather than waste the hour completely, we’re showing you the images instead. All pictures below were made by Midjourney. Each prompt was a bank’s name and nothing more. There were no cues given for style or context, no rerolls, no variations and no edits. The output might be thought of as a sort of Jungian word-association test for how the algorithm thinks about global finance. Maybe it’ll reveal something useful for the upcoming beauty parade of potential bookrunners to an AI bubble IPO rush, or maybe it’s just some pretty pictures. You decide.  The most common result when feeding a bank name into Midjourney is dark architecture. The examples below are Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas: “Deutsche Bank”  “BNP Paribas”  Citi’s dark architecture involves more of a suburban Unabomber’s cabin mood: “Citi”  While Santander, Bank of America and Société Générale all stay local and cast back to some imaginary past: “Santander”  “Bank of America”  “Societe Generale”  Architecture turns surreal with Commerzbank and China CITIC Bank: “Commerzbank”  “China CITIC Bank”  When there’s no “bank” in the name, the algo often falls back on marketing composites and alien corporate logos. Presenting along those lines are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered: “Morgan Stanley”  “JPMorgan Chase”  “Standard Chartered”  Another recurring theme is animals. There’s an on-brand sturdy horse for Lloyds and, for Wells Fargo, a cowboy horse in an unusual hat: “Lloyds”  “Wells Fargo”  The choice of animal sometimes strays quite far off brand. Goldman Sachs has a fish: “Goldman Sachs”  UBS has some kind of ox, bull, or possibly shaved yak: “UBS”  Barclays has a furious parrot: “Barclays”  And Swedbank has a disturbing pig: “Swedbank”  The child above also turns up for HSBC, this time loitering in a council estate’s open-air launderette: “HSBC”  If a bank’s name is just too vague to work as an image prompt the machine has a fever dream. That’s what happened with ING: “ING”  Prompts can also be overly specific in unhelpful ways, such as with BONY Mellon: “BONY Mellon”  After a few dozen of these it became difficult to avoid reading meanings into each vision. What does it suggest, for instance, that Credit Suisse is an antique loot box? “Credit Suisse”  Or that Nordea is a pack of playing cards half-buried in barren flatlands?  “Nordea”  Or that Peel Hunt is a travelling medicine man’s miracle elixir? “Peel Hunt”  Airbrushed steampunk hyper-realism is Midjourney’s favoured style, but not uniformly. Asking it to imagine Numis, for example, delivered a Pixar cartoon about a boy and his oversized bread bin: “Numis”  Nomura? Anime coffee: “Nomura”  Liberum? A perfume ad, or possibly a limited-pressing 12” of fey electronica: “Liberum”  Natwest? A made-for-Netflix movie starring Matthew Perry: “Natwest”  As for the dead banks, outputs for Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns proved unimaginative in strikingly different ways: “Lehman Brothers”  “Bear Stearns”  So in summary, though nothing has been learned, it involved AI so was pointless in a modern way.

"Credit Suisse ‘merch’ and the rush to buy history","From hats to pendants, branded products from troubled institutions have a curious appeal","As shares of Credit Suisse hover under $1, the price of its memorabilia is on the rise. When the storied Swiss bank ceased to exist practically overnight, rescued in a $3.25bn deal by rival UBS, baseball caps, ski hats and other items bearing its logos were posted on auction sites and racked up bids, as collectors tried to grab pieces of fashion, and financial, history. Credit Suisse knit hats with red, blue and white block stripes like a summer Popsicle are appearing on eBay and Swiss reseller websites such as Ricardo.ch. The retro, skiwear-like hats are being listed for more than $100, a phenomenon first reported by Reuters. A branded gold pendant was listed on eBay and sold for $250 within hours.  The appetite for clothes and accessories bearing the insignia of bygone corporations has been growing for years. Lehman Brothers tote bags, Bear Stearns hats and Bernard Madoff paperweights have long fetched high prices on resale sites, as brand-savvy millennials have become a dominant demographic in finance.   Wall Street has a long history of spectacular rises, and even more breathtaking falls from grace. These collapses become legend, and the items of merchandise tell a story. Wearers of Credit Suisse items can signal that they have both a handle on the history of financial calamity and a highly developed sense of irony. (Although, at a time of banking turmoil, many might not see the funny side.) “What is tasteless to one is a treasure to another, and what makes items collectible is not always a known science,” says Darren Julien, president and chief executive of Julien’s Auctions in Beverly Hills, which specialises in entertainment memorabilia. “The market is not just full of fans or people wanting to obtain something because they like the company, but also as an investment. Failed brands or things associated with tragedy can quickly make themselves famous by being in the news and that often creates a new fan base of collectors looking for the next sought-after treasure.” A protestor outside a branch of UBS in Bern, Switzerland, in a T-shirt referring to a history of banking crises © Bloomberg In recent years, Credit Suisse was beset by scandal, and some spectacular and inventive risk-taking that cost it billions. Silicon Valley Bank, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, was backfooted when rising interest rates caused long-duration fixed income investments to lose value, frightening depositors and leading to a run on the bank. Fear of further banking collapses shook the sector and helped catalyse Credit Suisse’s takeover. The rising popularity in fallen-company merchandise has been aided and abetted by popular “fin meme” accounts such as Litquidity and Arbitrage Andy. Both make memes that satirise finance culture, and sell merchandise for fans to get in on the joke.  The anonymous person behind the Litquidity account told the FT: “It’s about wearing something funny and making a statement . . . I have had conversations with people in their fifties and sixties who say, ‘I love your Bear Stearns merch, or Drexel because I worked there back in the day and it brings back fond memories’ . . . or maybe not fond memories, but it was certainly an interesting time.”  Litquidity launched “Debit Suisse” merchandise following the Archegos calamity, when Credit Suisse lost billions; sales of these items, which include a Debit Suisse Dad Hat for $35, have spiked in the past few days as the bank has dominated the headlines.  “When there is very big market news, that’s when people are rushing to buy it, because it’s relevant, it’s fresh,” says Litquidity’s founder. “Right before this was Silicon Valley Bank, which saw a big spike in sales as well. And that was a spectacular failure — it went from a niche bank to a mainstream name that everyone knows about.” He says he has been asked if there is “any discount for an affected Credit Suisse member?”. But for those who don’t work in banking, or can’t relate to financial black humour, there is an extra fashion layer to all this. Corporate swag, both real and spoof, has been in the fashion spotlight since 2015, when cult label Vetements produced a £185 DHL T-shirt that went viral (the courier group’s chief executive also began wearing one). Anya Hindmarch has created Kellogg’s cereal-branded bags and boots stamped with the logo of UK pharmacy chain Boots. For its autumn/winter 2017 menswear show Balenciaga retooled its logo on sweatshirts to look like the generic insignia of a big corporation, and put the name of its parent company, Kering, on a hoodie. More recently, London-based publisher and bookseller Idea Books has offered hats with wry slogans in corporate-style fonts. Popular with hipsters, the range includes the “All England Gardening Club” cap, and even a hat that would be appropriate for anyone at SVB (and possibly Credit Suisse, given the expected tens of thousands of job cuts). It reads: “I don’t work here.”  Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","23.03.2023"
"Deutsche Bank weighs on bank shares ","German lender falls 8% as concerns linger over impact of interest rate rises while US stocks close day higher","Bank stocks took a hit on Friday, led by Germany’s Deutsche Bank, as policymakers struggled to calm nerves after failures on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe’s Stoxx 600 banks index, which comprises the region’s biggest lenders, fell 3.8 per cent, outstripping weakness in broad national indices, led by an 8.5 per cent drop in Deutsche shares. Shares in Commerzbank fell 5.5 per cent as jitters over the wider sector persisted following the collapse of two regional US institutions and a rescue deal for Credit Suisse in recent weeks. Bigger US banks were also under pressure, with JPMorgan down 1.5 per cent and Morgan Stanley closing 2.2 per cent lower. Goldman Sachs and Citi lost 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.  Troubled regional lender First Republic Bank swung between losses and gains before ending the day down 1.4 per cent. However, a better session for peers including Zion took the KBW regional banking index 2.9 per cent higher on the day. “Clearly the main question is: What will be the next shoe to drop?” said Kevin Thozet, investment committee member at Carmignac. “What we are seeing is that market participants are trying to test where the next weak link in the banking sector is.” Downbeat sentiment in the banking sector and fears about contagion kept gains in check in broader markets. The US’s benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.6 per cent higher after more muted moves earlier in the session, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent. Meanwhile, Europe’s overall Stoxx 600 gauge closed 1.4 per cent lower.   Bank stocks have had a turbulent March as traders fret over the blow to lenders from central banks’ aggressive interest rate rises over the past year. “Europe is very tilted towards banks, which have been in the eye of the storm,” said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. “There are bank-specific issues to worry about like regulation and deposit safety.”  Deutsche’s slide came after a surge this week in the cost of insuring the lender’s debt against default.  The price of the bank’s five-year credit default swaps — derivatives that act like insurance and pay out if a company defaults on its payments — climbed from below 150 basis points on Wednesday to 200bp on Friday, according to data from Refinitiv. Global authorities have tried to assuage investors’ concerns after the failure of several US regional banks, and last weekend’s hasty takeover of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS. “Deutsche Bank has fundamentally modernised and reorganised its business and is a very profitable bank,” Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Friday, after being asked if the lender was the “new Credit Suisse”. “There is no reason to be concerned about it.”  European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde told a eurozone summit in Brussels that the banking sector was “strong” and that the ECB was fully equipped to provide liquidity to the euro area financial system if needed, according to an EU official. She insisted there was “no trade-off” between controlling inflation and fostering financial stability. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday said regulators were “prepared to take additional actions if warranted” to ensure the safety of bank deposits. But efforts to stem the selling have had only fleeting effects.  Central banks in the eurozone, US and UK have all pushed ahead with interest rate rises to fight stubbornly high inflation this month, despite the banking sector turmoil, which itself is partly the result of rapidly increasing borrowing costs over the past year. Fed officials on Friday doubled down on their decision to deliver a quarter-point rate rise despite the stress in the banking sector.  “There’s still a nagging question amongst market participants over whether the turmoil in the banking sector is over or if there will be wider contagion,” said Mobeen Tahir, director of macroeconomic research and tactical solutions at WisdomTree Europe.  “It is also now evident from central banks that the turmoil is not going to put a hard brake on their monetary policy actions — that’s sending jitters through markets because it might exacerbate or expose new vulnerabilities in the banking sector.” Dirk Willer, strategist at Citigroup, said it was “too early to tell” whether banking sector stress would have an impact on the wider US economy. But he added the Federal Reserve and the ECB had “become more cautious” about tightening monetary policy. He predicted the US was likely to enter a recession this year, noting that “the banking stress tightens credit”. Economists are now anticipating the Fed will pause its rate-raising cycle, keeping rates on hold at its next meeting in May before cutting in September, while anticipating a 0.25 percentage point rise from the ECB meeting and no cuts in 2023.

"Glencore profits hit record $34bn driven by soaring coal demand","Miner and commodity trader to return $7.1bn to shareholders after energy crisis boosts earnings","Glencore has reported record full-year earnings driven by high energy prices and the Ukraine war, highlighting how trading houses have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the energy crisis. The Switzerland-based miner and commodity trader’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 60 per cent to $34bn last year, the company said on Wednesday, triggering a record $7.1bn return to shareholders.  More than half of those earnings came from its coal-mining business, where ebitda more than tripled to $17.9bn.   One of the world’s largest trading houses, Glencore has profited from surging prices for the commodities it produces and from extreme volatility in commodities markets, which propelled its trading division’s profits to a record high.  However, coal prices have dropped recently as a mild European winter and high stockpiles lead to reduced demand. Chief executive Gary Nagle acknowledged weakness in the coal market but said the current prices were still high relative to historic norms.  “We have seen a year where people were desperate for energy, and we helped supply them, and have given them comfort that they would have the energy sources,” he said.  “Some of the tightness in the market [last year] was because of panic in the market, and Europe buying coal going into winter,” which had now eased, he added.  The powerful commodity trading houses that move raw materials around the world have reaped huge profits from the volatile energy prices triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago.   Glencore’s rival Trafigura also generated a record $7.1bn in net profit last year.  Last week, Trafigura reported a writedown of more than half a billion dollars relating to an alleged nickel trading fraud.  Nagle said on Wednesday that Glencore had no exposure to the companies allegedly involved, and that he was confident a similar incident could not happen at Glencore because of the company’s checks and controls. While traditional energy companies such as oil and gas producers have been subjected to windfall taxes in several European countries, including the UK, the trading houses have largely avoided similar treatment.  Nagle said Glencore had been hit with “material” windfall taxes on its coal production in Australia and Colombia, and that higher coal prices meant higher royalty payments to governments.  However, earnings from Glencore’s extensive trading operations, which generated $6.4bn in earnings before interest and tax last year, have been largely unaffected.  The company said its 2023 earnings would be significantly lower than last year’s, largely because of lower coal prices.   “Clearly, the cash returns going forward will diminish if the power crisis in Europe is over, and coal prices are structurally lower,” said Myles Allsop, analyst at UBS.  “Clearly, 2022 was peak for coal prices, a peak for Glencore’s earnings and now the debate is, how quickly will earnings and cash flow normalise,” he added.  Glencore’s coal business has also been the subject of questions from some of its shareholders, who filed a resolution last month asking for more clarity on how its production lined up with its climate goals. The group said on Wednesday that it planned to return $5.6bn in cash dividends to shareholders, along with a $1.5bn share buyback.  Glencore shares, which have climbed about 20 per cent over the past 12 months, rose 2 per cent in early London trading on Wednesday.  Last year, Glencore paid more than $1.6bn in penalties and pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and market manipulation, following a co-ordinated investigation by authorities in the US, UK and Brazil. Similar investigations are under way in Switzerland and the Netherlands.","15.02.2023"
"Banker accountability is easier to demand than deliver","Better financial conditions made it possible to believe that problems had been fixed — until the last two weeks","Hours after Swiss authorities pushed Credit Suisse into merging with its local rival UBS, CS leaders emailed staff. Don’t worry, previously scheduled bonuses and raises will go ahead, chair Axel Lehmann and chief executive Ulrich Körner wrote.  This comes on top of news that Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker sold nearly $30mn in shares over the past two years, including a $3.6mn chunk just days before the bank sparked a deposit run by revealing big losses on securities sales. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had to bail out the California lender. Cue the usual outrage. President Joe Biden and members of Congress from both parties rushed to propose legislation that would make it easier to claw back bonuses or stock sale proceeds from executives at failed banks of all sizes and ban them from the industry. “No one is above the law — and strengthening accountability is an important deterrent to prevent mismanagement in the future,” Biden said.  But accountability is a lot easier to demand than deliver. After the 2008 financial crisis, politicians and regulators promised to rewrite the incentive structure for banking. No longer, they said, would it be possible for executives to reap the upside of risky bets while counting on taxpayers to absorb the losses when the markets turned. Everyone agreed that pay must be tied more closely to long-term results through deferral periods and clawbacks if losses developed later. The 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law directed US regulators to come up with formal rules to this effect, and the EU wrote them into its laws along with a bonus cap. Yet scandals continued. A dozen global lenders were caught up in rate-rigging of Libor and foreign exchange rates in the 2010s. Wells Fargo shelled out billions in fines for aggressive sales targets that led employees to open millions of fake accounts. And JPMorgan Chase is fighting claims from women who allege the bank “benefited” from sex trafficking by convicted offender Jeffrey Epstein. However, benign financial conditions made it possible to believe that changes to pay and accountability had made banks safer if not actually nicer or culturally improved. Now we know better.  SVB executives were warned more than a year ago by their own consultants and supervisors at the San Francisco Federal Reserve about the bank’s inability to monitor and manage interest rate risks in its securities portfolio. Yet it fatally undermined depositor and investor confidence by racking up big losses on those holdings as rates rose. Credit Suisse made a series of bad calls on risky dealings with Archegos and Greensill Capital, and further unsettled the market last week by admitting to “material weaknesses” in its financial controls. That bank did build both deferrals and clawbacks into its pay plans, and Swiss authorities said on Tuesday they had blocked CS from paying out the SFr1.25bn in deferred pay already on its books. But they stopped short of blocking this year’s cash bonuses, to “avoid impacting employees who did not themselves cause the crisis.” But the US never finished writing those rules on pay and accountability. Two different drafts, one in 2011 and one in 2016, were put forward but not finalised, partly because there were profound disagreements about how best to make them work.   Dennis Kelleher, of the consumer group Better Markets, argues that pay rules can only do so much and authorities should make more use of their criminal powers when overseeing the sector: “Put a couple of them in jail and you’ll be surprised by much compliance you get.”  But prosecutors have largely failed to bring charges that stick, particularly against senior management. CEOs rarely send emails about specific operational decisions. The UK toyed with reversing the burden of proof for senior bank managers and requiring them to show they had not caused a regulatory breach but dropped the idea in 2015. Nearly eight years after Wells Fargo’s misbehaviour was made public, US prosecutors brought their first prosecution. Carrie Tolstedt, once retail banking head, agreed to plead guilty last week to obstructing a bank examination by leaving statistics about employee firings out of a 2015 memo. No one has been charged over the high pressure sales targets that led employees to misbehave in the first place. For all the stormy rhetoric about accountability now, the reality is likely to be somewhat different. The more lenders that wobble, the easier it is for their leaders to claim that no one could have expected the problems, and the harder it is to prove criminal negligence.  brooke.masters@ft.com Follow Brooke Masters with myFT and on Twitter Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"First Republic rallies as Yellen says US prepared to give more support","Treasury secretary defends ‘decisive and forceful actions’ by regulators to avert broader crisis","Shares of First Republic and other regional US banks rallied on Tuesday after Janet Yellen said the government stood ready to provide further support for smaller lenders if needed.  In an intervention designed to shore up confidence in the banking system after more than a week of turmoil, the US Treasury secretary said guarantees offered to depositors in the failed Silicon Valley Bank could be replicated at other institutions.  “The steps we took were not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks,” Yellen said in a speech to the American Bankers Association on Tuesday, which marked her most extensive comments yet on the banking turmoil.  “Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader US banking system,” she added. “And similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion.” Shares of First Republic, which have fallen about 85 per cent this month, rose almost 30 per cent to close at $15.77 a share in New York, leading a broader rally in US lenders. US Bancorp, KeyCorp and Zions rose between 7 and 9 per cent. The KBW Bank Index gained 5 per cent.  Casey Haire, US banks analyst at Jefferies, said Yellen’s public remarks had reassured investors. “Having the Treasury secretary comment that they would step in as necessary is the clearest sign yet regulators could act.”  The Treasury worked with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide guarantees for all deposits at failed SVB and Signature Bank, including those higher than the $250,000 threshold that are not covered by government insurance. In addition, the Fed announced a new facility to boost liquidity for struggling banks. While Yellen defended the “decisive” and “forceful” steps taken by regulators to avert a broader banking crisis in the US, the problems afflicting smaller institutions are far from resolved. A $30bn lifeline put together by Wall Street bank chief executives — and cheered by the US government — had initially failed to arrest the previous sharp sell-off in the shares of First Republic Bank.  In Europe, the turmoil that followed SVB’s collapse contributed to the collapse of Credit Suisse, which UBS has agreed to buy in a deal wiping out $17bn of bonds.  Since SVB’s crisis was brought to a head by the impact of interest rate rises on the bank’s bond portfolio, the problems afflicting the sector are also weighing on central banks. The Fed’s open market committee meets on Wednesday to decide whether to press ahead with a quarter-point rate rise or forgo an increase to help stabilise the financial system. Yellen suggested concerns in the US had been eased to some extent by market developments in recent days. “The situation is stabilising. And the US banking system remains sound,” she said. “Aggregate deposit outflows from regional banks have stabilised.” “We are squarely focused on doing our job,” she added. “And you should rest assured that we will remain vigilant.” Yellen stressed the current turmoil was different to that of the global financial crisis. “Back then many financial institutions came under stress due to their holdings of subprime assets. We do not see that situation in the banking system today,” she said. “Our financial system is also significantly stronger than it was 15 years ago. This is in large part due to post-crisis reforms that provided stronger capital standards, among other important improvements.” Yellen pointed to the importance of small and midsized banks to the US economy. A concern in recent days has been that the current crisis would strengthen larger financial institutions at the expense of smaller ones. “Large banks play an important role in our economy, but so do small and midsized banks,” she said. “These banks are heavily engaged in traditional banking services that provide vital credit and financial support to families and small businesses. They also increase competition in the banking sector, and often have specialised knowledge and expertise in the communities they invest in.”  As well as aiding individual bank depositors, US officials are also debating whether they need to take additional steps to restore confidence, including increasing or removing the $250,000 cap for deposits insured by the FDIC. Congressional support would be required for such a step unless Biden administration officials find a way to adopt the measure by executive action. In her speech, Yellen nodded to the potential for new banking reforms to strengthen regulation in the sector. “We are currently focused on the situation at hand. But we will need to re-examine our current regulatory and supervisory regimes and consider whether they are appropriate for the risks that banks face today,” she said. “We all share an interest in ensuring that the United States remains the strongest and safest financial system in the world.” Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.

"Investors in limbo land as trust in market rules wavers","The scrambled changing of the ‘waterfall’ structure at Credit Suisse could create long-term problems","A dozen years ago, I went to the London office of Credit Suisse for a tutorial about so-called “cocos” — or the contingent convertible bonds introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, in a bid to enable banks to absorb losses in a crisis.  The CS financiers duly presented a neat PowerPoint, complete with arrows and charts, which explained that cocos lay second from bottom in the capital structure. Thus if a bank went bust, its equity would be wiped out first, followed by the cocos, in order to protect senior creditors. In exchange for this risk, those bonds paid a high (ish) return to investors, reflecting the normal rules of financial capitalism. No longer. As the dust settles (or, more accurately, floats in mid-air) from the Credit Suisse drama, many astonishing details about this weekend’s acquisition of the bank by UBS are tumbling out. But the most striking detail to my mind is the Swiss National Bank’s decision to let CS equity holders keep $3bn of value, but wipe out the $17bn in AT1s (or “additional tier one” bonds), which are a variant of cocos.   This has sparked unusual criticism from European regulators. It may still spark legal action from bondholders, which include pension funds, insurance companies and other wealthy investors. “In my eyes, this is against the law,” Patrik Kauffmann, a fund manager at Aquila Asset Management, told the FT.  And while it is unclear how any court might respond (SNB appears to think the move is permitted), the real issue is about something more fundamental than legal niceties: trust in capitalist logic. A key tenet of free market theory, as any economics student knows, is that it rests on clear-cut laws about property ownership. And one corollary is that companies or investment funds operate with predictable “waterfall” structures that define how the assets of an entity are paid out if it collapses. Hence those neat CS banker presentations. But Sunday’s announcement has changed that waterfall structure. This, unsurprisingly, has caused the price of AT1 bonds issued by other banks to tumble. But it could also contribute to an insidious sense of investor doubt about the degree to which neutral laws will continue to underpin capital markets more widely. It is hard to escape the suspicion that the Swiss authorities decided to make (modest) payments to the equity holders — but not to bond investors — because the former included a powerful Saudi shareholder (that Bern did not want to offend). The interests of CS employees might have also played a role. Protectionism, geopolitical self-interest and state intervention, in other words, seem to have over-ruled free-market principles.  And while a cynic might argue that this always happens in a banking crisis, what makes the CS saga doubly pernicious is that it comes amid uncertainty about the legal structures surrounding US finance too.   More specifically, a key issue hurting sentiment around America’s regional banks and the Silicon Valley Bank disaster is that no one currently knows for sure how far the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s protection extends. Before last month, the FDIC mandate implied that protection was only given for the first $250,000 of deposits when institutions were not deemed to be systemically important (ie not monstrously large).   But when SVB and Signature failed, the protection was extended to all depositors. That could be invoked again if another bank wobbles: what the SVB saga has certainly shown is that it is ridiculous to define “systemic” purely by the size of an institution’s assets — panic can become systemically contagious even when small entities fail.  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here However, the Biden government has hitherto resisted extending FDIC insurance in a blanket manner, in spite of political pressure. Thus, it is not known how other institutions might be treated down the line. This creates the impression that capricious policies — rather than predictable capitalist principles — rule the day.  The net result, then, is that investors are in limbo land. They don’t know whether capital market laws will be a predictable pillar of faith for finance in the future, but they also don’t know whether US and European governments have the desire (or means) to stand behind all banks, and thus act as an alternative pillar of faith. No wonder fear abounds; moral hazard is rife, but in a deeply unpredictable manner.  Let us hope that governments can rectify this. If not, the scrambled CS solution may store up yet more long-term problems, even if it creates a sense of short-term reassurance. When “credit” — or “trust” in the Latin sense of the word — is shattered, it is painfully hard to restore; and not just at “Credit” Suisse.  gillian.tett@ft.com Letter in response to this comment:  It’s a myth that capitalism is run on free-market rules / From Pritam Singh, Emeritus Professor in Economics, Oxford Brookes Business School, Oxford, UK","20.03.2023"
"US stocks lose ground ahead of interest rate decisions","Fed expected to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this week","US stocks slipped, with investors hunkering down ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to raise interest rates to their highest since the 2008 financial crisis. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 finished 1.3 per cent lower on Monday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2 per cent. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, continuing to scale back the size of its increases. Early data have shown that the US central bank’s aggressive efforts to combat inflation are bearing fruit, but chair Jay Powell could yet buck expectations that the Fed will stop raising rates and cut them later in the year.  “A key uncertainty going into the meeting will be how Powell judges the evolution of financial conditions,” Pictet Wealth Management senior US economist Thomas Costerg wrote in a note. “The main hawkish risk in this meeting is that Powell expresses his uneasiness with the recent loosening in financial conditions, and the sharp run-up in equity prices so far this year.” Investors are also looking ahead to Apple and Alphabet’s fourth-quarter earnings in what is a busy week for corporate results. “We retain a least-preferred stance on US equities and the technology sector,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote on Monday. “We do not see much scope for US markets to rally in the near term, especially given our outlook for continued pressure on corporate profit growth.” The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six peers, gained 0.3 per cent, while 10-year Treasury yields rose 0.03 percentage points to 3.55 per cent. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 traded 0.2 per cent lower after fresh data showed a surprise 0.2 per cent drop in fourth-quarter German gross domestic product, just as Spain’s inflation rate rose 5.8 per cent in the year to January, up from 5.5 per cent in December. The UK’s FTSE 100 finished the session up 0.3 per cent. Equity markets have rallied this year on growing optimism that global growth will be less anaemic than feared, helped by falling energy prices in Europe and China’s abrupt reversal of zero-Covid measures in place since early 2020. Yet higher equity prices are thought to raise consumer spending — exactly what central banks, which are determined to drag down inflation, are trying to prevent.  Financial conditions have been further loosened by a weaker dollar, declining Treasury yields and tighter credit spreads, according to analysts at ING, “and it may feel that any further loosening, fuelled by talk of potential policy easing in the second half of the year, could undermine [the Fed’s] current actions in fighting inflation”.  The main question for the Bank of England, meanwhile, is whether it acknowledges its work is nearly complete. “We suspect it’s more likely to keep its options open,” the analysts said, adding that market expectations of European Central Bank rate cuts in 2024 were “premature”. Prices for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, settled 2 per cent lower to $84.90 a barrel, following a 1.1 per cent drop last week. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 2.2 per cent after shedding 2 per cent in the previous week. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.7 per cent, dragged lower by a 6 per cent decline for Alibaba. China’s CSI 300 gained roughly 0.5 per cent.","30.01.2023"

"Wall Street warns of riskiest US debt limit showdown since 2011","JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs fear repeat of confrontation that resulted in downgrade of country’s credit rating","Wall Street banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are warning that Washington is heading for the riskiest debt ceiling confrontation since 2011, when the US lost its risk-free credit rating. The fight over the debt ceiling could be the most important issue facing the US economy in 2023, according to a JPMorgan note to clients on Friday. Congress has had many tussles over the lifting of its borrowing limit in recent years and has never defaulted on its debt. But given the particularly fractious state of the legislative body, a deal to stop the world’s biggest economy from defaulting on its debt may be harder to seal this time, said JPMorgan’s chief US economist Michael Feroli.  The implications of a default were hard to predict, added Feroli, but could plausibly result in a “severe recession”.  “Even the best case will probably see the sort of brinkmanship that occurred in the 2011 debt ceiling crisis,” he said. The US Treasury bond market is the bedrock of the global financial system and a haven for central banks and investors globally. A debt default would in all likelihood have cascading implications across multiple asset classes and geographies. The government last week started taking “extraordinary measures” to meet its obligations after the country hit its $31.4tn borrowing limit. The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has demanded deep budget cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. The White House and Democratic majority in the Senate say that is not an option. In recent decades, the debt ceiling has regularly devolved into a partisan battle in Washington when government is divided. But some pundits think the looming showdown will be particularly difficult to resolve because Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy secured election in part by promising to play hardball with Democrats.  McCarthy was elected following 15 rounds of voting after a hardline minority refused to back his speakership, suggesting a fractured Republican caucus that may be unwilling to vote for a deal even if a compromise is reached.  “We have the most risk of debt limit problems since 2011,” said Alec Phillips, Goldman Sachs’ chief political economist, adding that this time round the US has more debt and higher interest rates. Pablo Villanueva, senior US economist at UBS, said “this is a bit of a different debt ceiling episode” because the Fed is engaged in quantitative tightening and “very rapidly” removing cash from the economy after years of monetary stimulus. “That’s why I think the debt ceiling is particularly important this time around,” he added. For now, US government and corporate bonds have started the year on an upbeat note, buoyed by signs of easing inflation and hopes the Fed will soften its stated intention of continuing to ratchet up interest rates. However, some market participants warn that investors are not pricing in the high-stakes confrontation, with many anticipating that Congress will capitulate. “In the past Congress has acted before the ‘X’ date,” said Villanueva. “So I think the market is assigning a very high probability of Congress acting again.”  Meghan Graper, global co-head of investment grade syndicate at Barclays, said: “The debt ceiling is not impacting our market now. But I’d expect any implications to be a second-half phenomenon.” Maureen O’Connor, global head of high-grade debt syndicate at Wells Fargo, said: “The debt ceiling this year smacks a little different than some of the debt ceiling drama we’ve dealt with in the last couple of years. “When we talk about Black Swan events, this is one of those,” she added.","27.01.2023"
"GSK struggles to make investors believe its growth story ","Industry watchers say UK-listed rival AstraZeneca has a stronger pipeline and benefits from its oncology expertise","The UK’s two biggest listed drugmakers both celebrated a strong start to 2023 this week and confirmed their forecasts for the rest of the year.  But while AstraZeneca’s growth story is well established, Emma Walmsley, GSK’s chief executive, is still trying to convince investors that she is delivering a “new chapter of growth” after many years of underperformance.  GSK shares are down 3 per cent over the past five years while AstraZeneca’s have soared more than 125 per cent. AstraZeneca shareholders are willing to pay 20 times forward core earnings per share for 2023, GSK’s are paying just 10 times.   Michael Leuchten, a UBS analyst, said investors were still waiting for GSK to show progress in its pipeline of drugs to help address patent expiries later in the decade. “The big difference between AstraZeneca and GSK is that one has a pipeline, the other one, not so much,” he said. Gareth Powell, head of healthcare at specialist fund manager Polar Capital, said AstraZeneca’s success in oncology had been particularly important. The company had created “really big drugs”, he added. “If you look at GSK, the mega blockbusters are few and far between.”  But Walmsley believes GSK is changing. Last year it completed its biggest restructuring for 20 years, spinning off its consumer health division, which sells over-the-counter medicines, as Haleon. It is using a £7bn dividend from the split to make acquisitions to fill its pipeline, including agreeing a $2bn deal in April to buy Canadian biotech Bellus Health.  GSK’s vaccine division has developed the first ever vaccine for the common infection respiratory syncytial virus, which it believes presents a similar sized market opportunity as its shingles vaccine, which generated £833mn of sales in the first quarter. Walmsley said this week that she believes the vaccine is just “days away” from regulatory approval.  Dani Saurymper, a portfolio manager at Pacific Asset Management, said Walmsley, who took over six years ago, was dealt “an incredibly challenging hand” and is not given enough credit for the changes she has made.  “GSK is a supertanker and invariably when you are trying to turn the ship, it takes a bit of time,” he said.  Heartburn hangover In the summer of 2021, US hedge fund Elliott Management urged the GSK board to consider a sale of its consumer health joint venture with Pfizer. By Christmas, Unilever had offered £50bn. GSK and Pfizer turned them down, hoping for £60bn.  Now, after the spin-off in July 2022, Haleon shares are up 14 per cent, though with a £32bn market capitalisation, and about £10bn in net debt at the end of last year, its enterprise value of £42bn is still significantly below the rejected bid. Some GSK shareholders are pleased with the split. Powell said it was a “super smart” way to allocate capital. One healthcare investor said it made strategic sense — but was overshadowed by worries about legal liabilities related to claims, which drugmakers deny, that heartburn drug Zantac, causes cancer. The saga has wiped billions off GSK’s stock, and that of other pharma companies that have owned it. “The unfortunate thing for them was that within weeks of the spin, they suffered from the Zantac explosion,” the investor said. “Sadly that means they don’t get the full value for any of their underlying business.”  Despite a victory last December that dismissed thousands of lawsuits claiming Zantac causes cancer, GSK still trades about 17 per cent lower than when the worries about Zantac emerged in August last year. GSK said it will contest the cases vigorously but with court dates set into 2024, the hangover is likely to persist.  Investors are now focused on how GSK spends its Haleon dividend. It must choose wisely because it has less firepower than many of its rivals, including Pfizer, which is buying oncology biotech Seagen for $43bn, and Amgen, which is set to acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $28.3bn.    Some shareholders questioned why it chose to re-enter oncology, a market Walmsley’s predecessor Andrew Witty had left, which is lucrative but very competitive.  Leuchten said GSK’s strategic direction in oncology is in question, after its Ovarian cancer drug Zejula suffered a setback, limiting its use in some patients because of safety concerns. It is also waiting for more results for its bone marrow cancer drug Blenrep, after one study showed it did not outperform a rival drug. The healthcare investor said AstraZeneca had benefited from “very fortuitous” timing, investing in oncology as the science made great leaps forward over the past decade, whereas GSK, coming later, had a “high-risk/high-reward strategy”.  AstraZeneca then built on its success, the investor added, so it now has a pipeline with drugs based on every current promising approach to cancer. Big gap to fill GSK itself acknowledges that it will limit its bets in a competitive field. On the company’s first-quarter earnings call this week, Walmsley said oncology was a “small but emerging” part of the business, and stressed the company’s leadership in infectious diseases, which account for two-thirds of the drugs in its pipeline target.  “It feels like they are pivoting back slightly into their historic therapeutic areas of success,” the healthcare investor said.  Chief commercial officer Luke Miels told the Financial Times at the end of last year that he was looking for bolt-on deals that can help fill the gap when GSK’s HIV medicine dolutegravir loses market exclusivity later in the decade.  It is a big hole to fill: products using dolutegravir generated £1.3bn in the quarter, about 19 per cent of total revenues of £7bn.  Leuchten said he believed the company was “too bullish” about its ability to replace revenues with its newer HIV drug. “I am worried about it because that is a very, very, very profitable part of their business,” he said.  But Saurymper said he thinks the company is being cautious about publicising its progress in HIV, because of fierce competition from US biotech Gilead.  The deals GSK has done so far will not on their own fill the gap left by dolutegravir but Andrew Baum, an analyst at Citi, said there was “clearly upside” to the Bellus deal, which gives GSK a specialist medicine to treat a debilitating condition called refractory chronic cough that affects 10mn people. But even though the healthcare investor believes GSK has more promise than it gets credit for, she said it has no presence in “multibillion-dollar opportunities” elsewhere, such as Alzheimer’s and obesity.  “In the UK market, you can choose between AstraZeneca, or GSK, or own both. It has been very obvious where the incremental [investor] money is being spent.” This story has been updated to include Haleon’s net debt and enterprise value. ","30.04.2023"
"‘Blunt and quite American’ — new Société Générale chief marks break with tradition","‘Things are going to be run differently’ Slawomir Krupa tells the FT ahead of his appointment at French bank’s helm","When Société Générale discovered in January 2008 that derivatives trader Jérôme Kerviel had secretly run up €4.9bn of losses, panicked managers assembled a task force to assess the wreckage and steer the French bank through the near-fatal crisis.  Among them was Slawomir Krupa, then a 33-year-old little known among SocGen’s top ranks, who was asked to help diagnose the risk control failures and shake up the bank’s internal culture. Fifteen years and several other clear-up operations later, the Franco-Pole, who is set to succeed Frédéric Oudéa as SocGen’s chief executive next week, is one of the survivors of an era of restructurings and setbacks that have diminished the bank’s value since the biggest rogue trading scandal in history.  The Kerviel episode ultimately helped launch Krupa on his way, people who have worked with him said, bringing him to the attention of senior leaders as he stepped up in his role advising then investment bank head Jean Pierre Mustier.  “He was more than a chief of staff — he was a colleague with whom I discussed everything,” recalled Mustier. “He had open access to all of my emails, he gave advice, we brainstormed on everything. He helped manage the Kerviel situation very forcefully.” Krupa, a graduate of French political science university Sciences Po who joined SocGen at 22, had until then spent the best part of a decade as an internal auditor at the bank’s inspection department, its breeding ground for high achievers.  Mustier left the bank the following year, his chances of running SocGen scuppered by the Kerviel scandal, although he later managed Italy’s UniCredit. Under Oudéa, Krupa went on to senior jobs running eastern Europe and in the investment bank, before a long stint as US boss.  Although almost a life-long SocGen employee — bar a two year hiatus in his 20s when he set up a fintech start-up in eastern Europe — Krupa’s appointment at next Tuesday’s shareholder meeting heralds one of the biggest cultural shake-ups in the French bank’s 159-year history. He will step into the role at a crucial time, with questions hanging over the strength of European lenders after several US banks collapsed in recent months and Credit Suisse was rescued by its Swiss rival UBS.  Since its failed merger with Paribas — thwarted by BNP’s hostile bids on both banks in 1999 — SocGen has been a perennial target for speculation over its viability and whether it will be a takeover target for bigger European peers. Its shares are down 16 per cent since the start of March, when Silicon Valley Bank in the US began to teeter. However, it was German lender Deutsche Bank that was hit hardest in the days following the collapse of Credit Suisse as its share price fell 14 per cent in a matter of hours and the cost of insuring its debt against default surged to a four-year high. “Everybody wakes up because some guy in the US shorts some totally illiquid assets and it becomes a topic for one of my peers,” Krupa said in an interview. “To some extent, it’s completely irrational and dysfunctional.” He added that although SocGen had been through a series of “nightmarish” situations during Oudéa’s reign — including a perilous eurozone crisis, heavy losses from its once-vaunted trading division and a €3bn loss on the sale of its Russian subsidiary — the bank had shown its resilience. “Throughout this time of massive change — the last 15 years — it was almost like a revolution in how the bank operates, how [it is] capitalised — we were solid and strong based on the quality of our business,” he said. Bankers and analysts have said that Krupa’s biggest challenge would be to entice investors back by giving SocGen a clearer identity, in a French market dominated by BNP Paribas as a leader in corporate and investment banking while Crédit Agricole is the biggest retail bank.  Once France’s second-biggest lender by market value behind BNP, SocGen has slipped to third place behind Crédit Agricole. Its price-to-book of 0.3 is among the lowest in European banking. “The real question that the CEO of SocGen has to answer is how to thrive being the third-largest bank in France with a heavy capital market exposure,” said Pimco chief executive Manny Roman, a former SocGen board member who worked with Krupa when he ran the bank’s US operations for five years. “At the end of the day, a French bank is a very slow-melting ice cube, where you close branches and try to rationalise the way it’s being run.” Krupa’s appointment was not a given when Oudéa, who is turning 60 in July, announced he would step down. Sébastien Proto, a former Rothschild banker and high civil servant brought into the bank four years earlier, was seen as the preferred successor, according to insiders familiar with the discussions. In a bank that has long favoured leaders from French political and institutional connections, the decision to pick Krupa is marking something of a break with tradition.  “Although he was raised in France, he’s multicultural and has a way of thinking and of tackling big topics that is different, with unexpected or fresh angles,” said Séverin Cabannes, SocGen’s former deputy chief executive, who retired at the end of 2021.   Born to Polish academic parents in Bulgaria, Krupa initially grew up in communist Krakow, before moving to Lille in northern France aged six. He credits his Polish background and the time he spent in the US with nurturing his direct management style.  “The way I work, what I expect of people day to day, the way my expectations are set out and followed on — certainly there are going to be style differences and in the end, things are going to be run differently,” Krupa said. Internally, the classical music and sailing fan is known for being hands on, jovial and abrupt. His reputation for “making things happen” could be what SocGen needed, some insiders said; others acknowledged it could ruffle feathers. Several former colleagues recalled his appointment as a troubleshooter in the US in 2016, when the bank was in the middle of tense discussions with regulators over sanctions violations that ultimately led to fines. Krupa reset ties with the Federal Reserve, but not without a patchy start. “He was giving it a lot of energy without a lot of results to start with, which was frustrating for him,” said one insider. “It was not an easy period for him or for us in Paris.” Krupa, whose executive team is a collection of longstanding SocGen managers and new hires, will unveil his plans at an investor day in September. “His personality doesn’t fit the stereotype of a French banker. He is very blunt and in some ways quite American,” said Seth Bernstein, chief executive of AllianceBernstein, the US investment firm that agreed to merge its equities business with that of SocGen last year. “He isn’t going to change — the question is, are they,” Bernstein said. “He is going to challenge convention and it is going to be interesting to watch how it develops.”","19.05.2023"
"The Lex Newsletter: AI’s so hot right now","Plus, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Kering","This article is an on-site version of The Lex Newsletter. Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader, I do not know how you see yourself. But I suspect it is not in the way you are seen by generative artificial intelligence. This is represented by the image of the gent on the left in the panel above. He is how Midjourney, a GAI bot, responded to a request for a picture of a successful businessperson reading a peach-coloured newspaper. The suit is a little too close-fitting. The mouth is smiling but the eyes are not. It would be wise to count your fingers after shaking hands with this guy. Let me know what you think of him, or Lex’s coverage at Lexfeedback@ft.com.  But it is fair to say that Midjourney generates imagery with impressive speed and competence. Such coups de théâtre — notably in text generation by OpenAI’s ChatGPT bot — have impressed investors. For this reason, progress in commercialising AI, or the lack of it, dominated Big Tech earnings reports this week. Revenues from AI were nowhere to be seen in Amazon’s first-quarter results. Chief executive Andy Jassy has previously noted that large language models take billions to develop. Lex reckons he should focus more prosaically on using machine learning better in the ads business.  Meta may be ahead in this respect. It has been investing heavily in AI tools for advertisers and users out of a big R&D budget of $9bn last quarter. This could target digital advertising more precisely. AI has a much brighter future at Meta than virtual reality headsets. These are no more than niche technology for the moment. A downturn in ad spend has triggered cost-cutting at Alphabet. Google Cloud provided some atonement for divisional operating losses of nearly $3bn last year with first-quarter profits of $191mn. The business is redoubling its efforts to compete in AI. Lex reckons Microsoft can get along very well without the $75bn purchase of games group Activision Blizzard, blocked this week by the Competition and Markets Authority, a UK trust-buster. The company did a better deal when it invested in ChatGPT. The chatbot plugs into the tech giant’s Azure cloud computing service. Microsoft says it now has more than 2,500 “Azure OpenAI” customers. Its shares are up a quarter this year.   Lex, not always the earliest adopter, was tinkering around on ChatGPT more than a year ago. We were therefore a little blasé when ChatGPT-4 went on general release earlier this year, wowing and alarming pundits in equal measure. Midjourney, a San Francisco start-up, has come as more of a revelation. A few hours fiddling with its GAI bot revealed some interesting wrinkles: It is good at avoiding potential infringement of commercial branding rights. It took tinkering with the wording of requests to produce images including a newspaper with a vague FT peach tinge to it. As to delivering any pictures featuring Mickey Mouse, forget it.The GAI is happier appropriating the visual style of artists. We have published the picture of the Mona Lisa advertising beer because Leonardo da Vinci has been dead for 500 years, taking his work out of copyright. But the GAI bot willingly pastiched David Hockney and other artists who are still alive.The bot is also comfortable producing caricatures of western politicians, such as Donald Trump or Joe Biden. If you ask for a cartoon of thin-skinned Chinese president Xi Jinping, Midjourney responds that his name is “banned” and threatens to block future access. It will, however, illustrate state oppression of Chinese Muslims. Unconscious bias may be a problem. Midjourney envisaged a successful businessperson as a woman or a man of colour in one out of a dozen attempts. Opinion-generative organic intelligence Back in the financial world, a slew of non-tech businesses had results of their own to report. For some European bank bosses, it was a case of saying “move along, nothing to see here” in the wake of recent turmoil. Lex questioned how long strong profits at Barclays will last. Rate-setters may proceed more cautiously following lender failures. However, chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan says there will be no immediate peak in net interest income because interest rate hedges are slowly rolling off. The more intractable problem is Barclays’ low valuation of about half tangible book value. The volatile earnings of its investment bank are partly to blame.  My secret shame is that I am emotionally supportive of Europe having at least one large, indigenous investment bank. I am unable to square this with the reality that this devalues the shares of any universal bank that owns a would-be regional champion.  This is a problem investors in Deutsche Bank need to grapple with. It has agreed to buy mid-cap UK investment bank Numis for £410mn. Germany’s dominant lender has stabilised partly by virtue of reducing exposure to wholesale dealmaking and securities trading. A further problem is that Europe-listed banks and wealth managers suffer an automatic discount compared with peers in the US or Asia. We believe chief executive Sergio Ermotti can narrow, though not eliminate, the valuation gap between UBS and Morgan Stanley if he integrates Credit Suisse slickly.  We figure Standard Chartered also looks cheap relative to immediate peer HSBC. Both are listed in the UK but focus on Asia. There were plenty of non-financial results this week, including sales figures from Gucci owner Kering which notably lagged behind rivals. The valuation of LVMH, the standout winner in the luxury stakes, hit $500bn this week. Kering is worth about €71bn. Optimists hope new creative boss Sabato De Sarno will inspire a revival. Lex thinks the real problem is uninspired management led by chief executive François-Henri Pinault. A bunch of rather more downmarket consumer goods groups published numbers. They included PepsiCo, McDonald’s and General Motors. This played to accusations of “greedflation” — the purported use of inflation as an excuse for unnecessary price rises. Lex’s phlegmatic response was that business can generally be relied on to increase prices to maintain profitability at the expense of volumes. Wake up and smell the capitalism, in other words. Some stuff I have enjoyed this week I am still reading Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. I meanwhile got all the way through The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano. This seminal personal account of enslavement and hard-won freedom energised British abolitionism in the 18th century.  The author, in his time a battle-hardened Royal Navy powder runner and plantation overseer, emerges as a mercurial, brilliant and contradictory figure. I have meanwhile been pondering what the heck to do with inherited taxidermy, including a stuffed owl, now that such trophies are politically incorrect. You can read my column here.

"Credit Suisse under siege","The fear bug jumps to Europe","This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. On Tuesday, we asked if another bank would fall. We were thinking about America, not Europe. Yet it is Credit Suisse that is teetering. In the early hours of Thursday morning in Switzerland, the bank said it would “pre-emptively” take up to SFr50bn ($54bn) from the Swiss central bank’s just-announced liquidity backstop. The global banking system, suddenly, is in play. Join Rob today at 12pm ET/4pm GMT for an FT subscriber-only webinar to discuss the latest developments.

Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com. Credit Suisse When a bank announces at 2am local time that it is borrowing from the government, that is not a good sign. In both the US housing crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis that followed it, announcements such as this were as likely to stoke fear as to soothe it.  Yet the lesson of Mario Draghi and “whatever it takes” is that the government controls the printing press. A wall of money, deployed correctly, absolutely can avert disaster. So it is far too early to write an obituary for Credit Suisse. For all its scandals and mistakes, it had a strong and liquid balance sheet as of Wednesday, and a strong brand in wealth management to go with it. As the FT reported, Credit Suisse spent Wednesday afternoon reaching out to Swiss authorities to ask for a public statement of confidence. Around 8pm Zurich time, the statement came, reassuring markets that “if necessary, the [Swiss National Bank] will provide CS with liquidity”. That alone, it seems, was not enough. Six hours later, around 2am, Credit Suisse said it was taking decisive action to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity by intending to exercise its option to borrow from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) up to CHF 50 billion under a Covered Loan Facility as well as a short-term liquidity facility, which are fully collateralised by high quality assets The bank also announced it would buy back SFr3bn ($3.2bn) in “senior debt securities.” This looks to us like Credit Suisse signalling to markets that it has the financial wherewithal to buy back its distressed debt. The message is: taking liquidity from the SNB is not just a last-ditch effort to save the bank; we are planning for the future. This well might turn out to be true. We’ll learn more today. Is the Credit Suisse panic related to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last week? The two businesses are extremely different, and the losses on long-term securities that fatally wounded SVB do not appear to be a problem at Credit Suisse. Yet the two crises are linked. At some point in every central bank rate-increase cycle, things break and people get scared. That fear seeks a host. SVB broke, fear was released and Credit Suisse was the softest target.  While the Swiss bank’s balance sheet was sturdy, its reputation was not. A series of scandals, most of them emanating from its executive suite and its wobbly investment banking unit, has corroded the brand. Its strongest franchise, wealth management — a business grounded in reputation — suffered the consequences. Assets under management in that division fell by 27 per cent in 2022. Profitability crashed. Worse, the bank’s deposits went the same direction, falling by 37 per cent in the fourth quarter alone.  This is how a bank profitability problem, in a climate of fear, can turn into an existential threat. What might happen next? With the Swiss authorities standing behind Credit Suisse, it seems highly unlikely that a liquidity shortfall will sink it. This makes a classic bank run much less likely. But while a government can provide liquidity, it cannot provide a business model. Depositors and wealth management clients have to see a reason to stay with the bank. The FT reports that before news of the SNB’s liquidity backstop, JPMorgan analysts thought that should the situation worsen, the most likely scenario . . . is a sale of the lender to local rival UBS . . . An equity injection by the SNB is also a possibility as is allowing Credit Suisse to try to fix its own problems by selling a minority stake in its retail bank and using the proceeds to restructure the rest of the group. However, the JPMorgan analysts said it was unlikely that Credit Suisse would be allowed to fail because of its importance to the Swiss economy and Zurich’s status as a global financial centre. We agree that the SNB has the tools to prevent an immediate failure, whether caused by a run or something else. We also agree that the bank’s structure might look very different in a matter of days or weeks. We make no predictions. All we know for certain is that there is no returning to the status quo ante.

"Investors have wiped $165bn of value from big US bank stocks this month","Shareholders are worried about lower profits and more regulation after collapse of Silicon Valley Bank","The six largest Wall Street banks have lost almost $165bn in market capitalisation this month, or 13 per cent of their combined value, hit by worries over Credit Suisse’s financial strength and the fallout from the largest US bank failure since 2008.  Shares of Citigroup and Morgan Stanley suffered the biggest sell-off on Wednesday, while Bank of America shares fell to a more than two-year low. Investors said the three banks plus Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are being hurt by predictions that profits will be squeezed.  Investors do not think the largest US lenders will suffer the same fate as Silicon Valley Bank, which was forced to sell a portfolio of securities at a $2bn loss after customers pulled out their cash. Indeed, the bigger banks are experiencing an influx of deposits as customers seek safety amid fears over the health of smaller regional players.  But that has not protected them from a sharp sell off amid fears they will have to pay higher rates to depositors, hurting profits, while also facing the prospect of tougher regulation following the recent turmoil and rising loan delinquencies if the US falls into a recession.  Jason Goldberg, banking analyst at Barclays said: “The market never likes uncertainty. And there’s just a lot of uncertainty right now. The ultimate fallout . . . is still trying to be understood.” One large investor in financial stocks said: “It is reasonable to expect that the regulatory rules will change and that the profile of the bank is going to change if they’re required to hold more liquidity and more capital. All that is going to increase costs and reduce profitability.” Investors are also cutting the value they ascribe to the assets held by the nation’s largest banks. In early 2022, the KBW Index, which tracks 22 large banks, traded at an average multiple of 1.5 times book value. That multiple fell below 1 last week for the first time since 2020. Banks with large trading arms also suffered on Wednesday from concerns about their potential exposure to Credit Suisse, after investors wiped almost a quarter off the Swiss lender’s shares.  “It’s kind of a repeat of the 2011 European financial crisis, where all of a sudden people are wondering, who’s got counterparty exposure?” said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski, referring to the eurozone debt crisis 12 years ago which shook confidence in the banking system.   The share price falls at the big banks are much smaller on a percentage basis than the dramatic collapse in midsized bank stocks. The Fed has already said it is considering tougher rules for the medium-sized banks, which would cut into profits. The KBW regional bank index is down 19 per cent since the start of March.  Bank stocks are also being hit by a belief that lenders will have to start increasing the interest they pay to depositors. For many financial institutions, the gap between what they charge for loans and what they have to pay on deposits, known as net interest income, has buoyed earnings at a time when mortgage lending has fallen sharply and delinquencies on auto loans are rising. In a note on Wednesday, UBS wrote of the largest banks: “While the bank stock performance is stabilising a little throughout the day as investors get more comfortable on going concern risk, now investors are also concerned about deeper NII cuts from greater deposit outflows.” Analysts watching the sell-off in the wake of SVB’s collapse speculated that the blanket sale of financials was down to algorithms used by large investors to screen for financial similarities to the failed California bank.  Those might include large paper losses on their bond portfolios — which are stuffed with securities that have declined in value as the Fed has raised rates — and a high reliance on large depositors who are not ordinarily covered by federal insurance and are more likely to move their money.  “The hedge funds and the bears did big screens with data to see who has high unrealised losses,” said Rich Repetto, an analyst at Piper Sandler.  Funds used that data to identify those banks that would “take a hit relative to the equity capital that they have” if they were forced to sell securities at a loss, regardless of the strength of their business.   Still, some asset managers who invest in the large banks said they believed the sell-off was “collateral damage” from SVB, and were prepared to increase their holdings in banks if the sell-off made prices more attractive. The federal regulators’ decision to guarantee all deposits, including those above the usual $250,000 cut off, at SVB and Signature, which also collapsed over the weekend, helped slow down the sell-offs but did not stop them. The whole situation “is potentially creating opportunities”, said a person familiar with the investment strategy of one large asset manager. “Before we start jumping in with two feet, we have to be comfortable that the contagion risk is basically behind us.” ","16.03.2023"
"ECB officials warn of more interest rate rises as high inflation persists  ","Officials say they may need to raise rates to hit 4% unless they see ‘clear signals’ that core price pressures are easing","European Central Bank officials have warned that they expect to raise interest rates to record highs after eurozone inflation for February was higher than forecast, even as economists predict a rapid easing in price pressures from the summer. Persistently high inflation, driven by stronger rises in the price of food, goods and services that are offsetting a sharp decline in energy price growth, is a worrying sign for the ECB that they may have to raise rates higher than ever before to curb price pressures. “If we don’t get clear signals that core inflation is going down, we’ll have to do more,” Belgium’s central bank boss Pierre Wunsch, who sits on the ECB governing council, told reporters in Brussels, saying it could mean that “looking at rates of 4 per cent would not be excluded”.   Data released this week showed annual inflation in the 20-country single currency zone dipped to 8.5 per cent in February, down from 8.6 per cent in January but above economists’ predictions for a bigger fall to 8.2 per cent. Core inflation, which central bankers watch closely as it excludes energy and food prices to give a clearer picture of underlying pressures, hit a record high of 5.6 per cent last month. Coupled with recent US data showing upward price pressures on prices and wages, the eurozone data added to evidence that inflation is likely to stay uncomfortably high for longer than forecast, increasing workers’ calls for higher wage rises to offset soaring living costs. “We’re going from an energy shock to another with different drivers such as salaries and fiscal policy,” said ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos, pointing to the inflationary effect of large government support measures. Headline inflation was likely to keep decelerating to below 6 per cent by mid-year, he predicted, while warning that “underlying inflation is going to be more stable”.  The ECB has raised rates by 3 percentage points since last summer. Financial markets are pricing in a jump in the bank’s deposit rate to 4 per cent later this year, up from 2.5 per cent. That would overtake the 2001 peak of 3.75 per cent.  Policymakers have said another half percentage point rate rise is almost certain at the ECB’s meeting on March 16 and several said more rises may be needed after that. “My personal expectation is that the increase we intend for our March meeting — 0.5 percentage points — will not be the last one,” said Slovenian central bank governor Boštjan Vasle.   The biggest weekly rise in borrowing costs for eurozone governments this year was a reflection of how investors were lifting their bets on how high the ECB will raise rates. Germany’s two-year borrowing costs rose this week from 3 per cent to more than 3.2 per cent, a 14-year high.  Economists said price pressures were still likely to dissipate rapidly from this summer. “March data should be more encouraging and we still expect core inflation to come down by the summer,” said Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management.  Sandra Phlippen, chief economist at Dutch bank ABN Amro, said services inflation could “move higher” in the first half of the year, driven up by rising wage pressure. But she said the trend should reverse by the second half “as the economic slowdown and deteriorating overall labour market conditions are expected to reduce wage growth”. Dirk Schumacher, an economist at French bank Natixis, predicted the ECB would cut its inflation forecast for the first time in over two years when it publishes new predictions in two weeks’ time.  “I am quite convinced that inflation will be lower in three months — including core. I am obviously a lot less sure by how much,” he said, pointing out that energy prices have fallen sharply, supply chain pressures are abating, consumer spending looks set to weaken and wage growth remained relatively contained. Anna Titareva, economist at UBS, said the Swiss bank’s eurozone pay tracker showed wage growth had picked up to 3.4 per cent in the year to January, up from 3.2 per cent the previous month “with a risk of further acceleration”. But she predicted inflation in the bloc would still fall from 5.3 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent next year, before finally hitting the ECB’s 2 per cent target in 2025.","03.03.2023"
"Dealmakers’ worst nightmare","Plus, boutique investment bank Raine pockets a huge fee and Deutsche Bank’s chair makes his mark","One thing to start: Top executives from Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank refused to commit to voluntarily handing back the millions of dollars they were paid before the collapse of their banks triggered a US regional banking crisis. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter Lina Khan has dealmakers on edge Raine bags a monster feeDeutsche Bank and good governance US trustbusters are just getting started  Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter, America’s antitrust tsars, have dealmakers the world over on edge again.  The Federal Trade Commission’s decision on Tuesday to file a lawsuit to block Amgen’s $28.3bn deal to acquire Horizon Therapeutics was unexpected as most of the people involved didn’t think there was an obvious antitrust risk. They might ultimately end up being right but that’s not the point. Khan and Kanter aren’t just in the game to block deals, they want to scare chief executives from even thinking about doing transactions that promote rampant consolidation. And most dealmakers think they’re very good at it. “Jonathan Kanter at DoJ and Lina Khan at the FTC — they’re just anti-deal and in a sense they’re anti-the law,” said Paul Weiss’s Scott Barshay, one of the most prolific dealmakers of his generation, at a conference earlier this year. “They think the law on antitrust is not robust enough, so they want to move the law to essentially be able to stop more deals.” Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission © Bloomberg Mergers challenged or blocked by the duo (with the help of friendly regulators in the UK and EU) include Microsoft’s $75bn acquisition of gaming company Activision Blizzard, Lockheed Martin’s planned $4.4bn acquisition of US missile products supplier Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the $2.2bn merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster. Khan and Kanter said early on in their tenure that they would try to sue to block deals even if they knew they might lose the legal battle. The Biden administration officials are willing to litigate at all costs because it gives them the chance to build precedent for new case law and provides them with a stage to explain their vision to the world. This memo Khan sent to staff in September 2021 spells out some of the fundamental pillars of her vision: (1) protect workers and independent businesses as well as consumers from antitrust violations, and (2) target the root causes rather than one-off effects of competition violations.  The other crucial point is that Khan and Kanter want to prevent existing big players from buying up innovative start-ups that could one day become their new challengers — a good example being Facebook buying Instagram back in the day for about $1bn. It’s hard to quantify exactly how successful Khan and Kanter have been because we don’t know how many deals haven’t happened on fears they will get challenged.  But to quote one former FTC chair, William Kovacic, who spoke to DD: “A major, enduring accomplishment of Lina Khan and other advocates of transformation is that they have changed the debate . . . about the ends and means of competition policy . . . elevat[ing] an egalitarian vision of competition law that seeks to improve the wellbeing of citizens.” Make it Raine Vince McMahon had a plan when he made a controversial return to the World Wrestling Entertainment board in January after leaving last year over a corporate governance scandal. The time to sell his professional wrestling empire was 2023 and he knew whose help he wanted. McMahon and his family had for years relied on the founders of the merchant bank, Raine Group, for deals and strategic advice. That relationship is about to pay handsomely.   Securities filings show it is set to make a juicy $65mn fee from WWE’s recently announced $21bn combination with Endeavor’s Ultimate Fighting Championship. Raine Group’s Joe Ravitch, left, and Jeff Sine © FT montage/Bloomberg/AFP via Getty Images Raine, which is also a media investor, has been active in sports and football deals — in particular working on the completed Chelsea Football Club transaction as well as the current Manchester United process. The firm punches well above its weight with its  fewer than 200 employees. Joining Raine on the WWE mandate are JPMorgan Chase and Moelis, which each will get $25mn for their work. The $115mn in total deal fees to be paid by WWE is at the high end of comparable transactions. But the money may be worth it to McMahon — he found a big price for his company during a tough time for buyers and sellers to agree. Deutsche Bank’s chair makes his mark  After years of scandals, the bar at Deutsche Bank for exercising corporate governance may be lower than at its rivals. That has helped earn board chair Alexander Wynaendts, who is one year into his term, praise for taking steps that at other companies might be considered routine business.A Dutch former insurance executive, Wynaendts has proved the sceptics that feared he might be a mere figurehead wrong, by pushing back against the bank’s management and working to rebuild its reputation. That has included deepening internal transparency and fostering debate.Notably, Wynaendts sided with regulators to oust the head of DWS, the asset manager 80 per cent owned by Deutsche, in the face of greenwashing allegations. Wynaendts thought that departure was an “obvious decision”, people familiar with his views told the FT’s Olaf Storbeck, despite the fact that the bank’s top brass had publicly backed the executive.Then there was the decision to impose a reduction on bonuses, including a €145,000 cut for chief executive Christian Sewing. His management style is different to that of his predecessor Paul Achleitner, though he faces similar issues, including flaws in internal controls, regulators demanding continuous improvements, a bloated bureaucracy and high costs. For his part, Wynaendts maintains that he is deliberately keeping a low public profile, even as he reshapes the bank. “We still need to regain the trust and confidence,” he told the FT.

"Swiss central bank offers Credit Suisse liquidity backstop ","Lender tumbles as much as 30% after top shareholder rules out participating in equity raise","The Swiss central bank said it would provide a liquidity backstop to Credit Suisse after the lender’s shares fell as much as 30 per cent and sparked a broader sell-off in European and US bank stocks. In a joint statement with financial regulator Finma on Wednesday evening, the Swiss National Bank said there were “no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions due to the current turmoil in the US banking market”.  Credit Suisse executives held talks with representatives from the SNB and Finma on Wednesday afternoon after the bank’s equity and bonds plunged in value following the failure of three US banks last week. The Financial Times first reported that Credit Suisse had requested a public statement of support.  “Credit Suisse meets the higher capital and liquidity requirements applicable to systemically important banks,” the SNB and Finma said. “In addition, the SNB will provide liquidity to the globally active bank if necessary.” The steep share price decline came after the chair of the Saudi National Bank, which bought a 10 per cent stake in Credit Suisse last year, ruled out providing the Swiss lender with any more financial assistance. The bank has been hit by a series of scandals in recent years, including the biggest trading loss in its 167-year history following the implosion of Archegos Capital and the closure of $10bn of investment funds linked to collapsed finance firm Greensill. Credit Suisse shares closed down 24.2 per cent on Wednesday, pushing its market value below SFr7bn ($7.6bn). Shares in the bank, which raised SFr4bn of capital just a few months ago, are down 39 per cent this year and 85 per cent over the past two years. On a call with several hundred clients on Wednesday, analysts from JPMorgan suggested that the SNB might guarantee Credit Suisse’s deposits and force it to sell its investment bank, according to people who were briefed. However, the analysts thought the most likely scenario if Credit Suisse’s situation deteriorates is a sale of the lender to local rival UBS, one of the people said. An equity injection by the SNB is also a possibility as is allowing Credit Suisse to try to fix its own problems by selling a minority stake in its retail bank and using the proceeds to restructure the rest of the group.   However, the JPMorgan analysts said it was unlikely that Credit Suisse would be allowed to fail because of its importance to the Swiss economy and Zurich’s status as a global financial centre.  Octavio Marenzi, analyst at Opimas, said: “The [SNB] and the Swiss government are fully aware that the failure of Credit Suisse or even any losses by deposit holders would destroy Switzerland’s reputation as a financial centre.” Credit Suisse declined to comment.  Separately, the European Central Bank has asked EU lenders to disclose their exposures to the Swiss lender, a person familiar with the matter told the FT. The ECB debated making a public statement to try to calm the waters, but as of Wednesday afternoon it had decided against doing so for fear of adding to market panic, the person added. The US Treasury said it was “monitoring this situation and has been in touch with global counterparts”.   The slide in Credit Suisse’s shares reignited a broader sell-off in bank stocks in Europe and the US, which were reeling this week from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, ING and Barclays lost between 9 and 12 per cent. In the US, JPMorgan fell 4.7 per cent and Citigroup declined 5.4 per cent.  Investors said Credit Suisse’s problems were a reminder that Europe’s banks also had large bond portfolios, the paper value of which has been hammered by rising interest rates. “Credit Suisse is an isolated case,” said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank. “But banks in Europe, because of regulatory pressure, had to load up on negative-yielding bonds at the worst time and now they are facing major unrealised losses.” Asked on Bloomberg TV whether Saudi National Bank would be open to providing capital to Credit Suisse if there was a call for additional equity, SNB chair Ammar Alkhudairy said: “The answer is absolutely not.” He said owning more than 10 per cent of Credit Suisse would result in unwanted regulatory requirements, though he added he supported the bank’s restructuring plan and did not think it needed more capital.   Credit Suisse on Tuesday revealed that its auditor, PwC, had identified “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls. That led to the delay of the publication of its annual report last week after the US Securities and Exchange Commission asked for more clarity on the flaws.

"Whitney Museum artwork sale proves polarising","Plus: Korean art fair launches in London; first art-world pay report; and Sotheby’s offers Freddie Mercury collection","The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York has decided to “de-accession” (sell) seven works from its collection, once again raising the issue of whether museums should consider key pieces as financial assets. Four works by Edward Hopper, including the landscape painting “Cobb’s Barns, South Truro” (1930-33, estimate $8mn-$12mn), have been consigned for sale at Sotheby’s New York next month along with two pieces by John Marin and a painting by Maurice Prendergast. The funds will be used to expand the museum’s collection with a focus on contemporary art, says the Whitney, whose endowment is $411mn. “The works were carefully reviewed and selected by Whitney Museum stakeholders as part of this scholarly examination of the institution’s collections. It was determined that the works were duplicative within the collection,” the museum adds. But disposing of works for sale is polarising. A former US museum director, who prefers to remain anonymous, says: “Provided that the museum uses all sale proceeds for the purchase and direct care of newly acquired artworks, this is in line with the Association of Art Museum Directors guidelines. The only question is the extent to which mining historical collections to purchase contemporary art will become a trend, and in so doing sacrifice works that in the fullness of time will be missed.”  ‘Hojakdo by the Fireplace’ by Na Ri Choi (2022)   The Korean wave rolls on with the launch of a new art fair in London this summer at Mall Galleries near Trafalgar Square. The new event, known as Korean Art London (July 6-22), is founded and funded by Rok Hee Hwang, chief executive of Mews Gallery in Gangwon-do, South Korea. Hwang is a businesswoman who has worked in hotels, real estate and galleries in South Korea, New Zealand and Australia.  She is bringing works by more than 30 contemporary South Korean artists to London, including Na Ri Choi, Ha Jin Lee and Sung Hee Kim. “The artists do not pay to participate. They have been selected and are a combination of established names and emerging talent,” says a spokesperson for the fair. Each of the artists will be given a solo booth, with price points ranging from a few hundred pounds to thousands.  “My priority with Korean Art London is to bring a survey of first-rate South Korean contemporary art to the London market . . . I also want to provide an opportunity for Europeans to start their Korean art collections,” says Hwang. She is planning to open a London gallery after the fair that will specialise in Korean art.  “The art world is still notoriously opaque when it comes to disclosing details about pay, promotions and opportunities,” says the foreword to a new report which aims to lift the lid on pay across the sector, produced by London-based recruitment business Sophie Macpherson Ltd. The data, informed by the company’s work between January and December 2022, delves into salaries in organisations such as art advisories, auction houses, commercial galleries and communications agencies. A senior director at a UK art advisory can, for instance, earn an average base salary of around £100,000, rising to over £150,000; in the US, the equivalent post can come with a salary of more than $200,000. The report, billed as the first of its kind to focus specifically on the art market, stresses that “there is mounting pressure on art world businesses to not only review their pay structures in line with socio-economic developments, but also to be more upfront and open about the basic pay they are offering”. The US has led the way, with state-led transparency laws rolled out in New York last November. Ominously, the report notes that “since Brexit, and in the aftermath of the pandemic, the import and export of art has become more complicated in the UK. As such, the local job market is no longer evolving at the same rate, or with the same fervour, as other global hubs.” In other words, Paris and Berlin are coming to the fore and may take the shine off London. “The UK employment market continues to be buoyant, and growing post-pandemic, just not at the same rate as other markets,” says Rosie Allan, managing director at Sophie Macpherson Ltd, who helped compile the document.  Keija Wu, author of ‘A Modern History of China’s Art Market’, which is published next month  A publication out next month, A Modern History of China’s Art Market, provides a detailed analysis of how China’s art trade has exploded over the past three decades. Author Kejia Wu points out in her introduction that “back in 1992, art transaction volume was so low that a standalone auction law framework had not yet been necessary to be enacted”. Today, the two largest art auction houses in China are catching up with western peers. Wu says that in 2021, total turnover of sales at Poly Auctions amounted to Rmb11.1bn ($1.72bn), 80 per cent of which was Beijing Poly, the rest Poly Hong Kong.  According to the latest Art Market report published by Art Basel and UBS, however, China’s zero-Covid policies, which meant the cancellation of many events and auction sales, led the UK to overtake it as the second biggest market in 2022. Wu’s study also highlights how the NFT market in China will be shaped by the government’s strict regulatory framework. “Once the digital infrastructure is in place [by 2025], the regulator plans to establish a unified market where all digital arts and cultural products, including NFTs, based on China’s own blockchain will be traded,” she writes.  ‘Type of Beauty’ by James Jacques Tissot (1880) © Barney Hindle And finally, Sotheby’s will be hoping for a kind of magic as the eclectic collection of Queen frontman and rock legend Freddie Mercury goes under the hammer this September in London. The trove of costumes, lyrics, fine and decorative artworks and Japanese clothing has been consigned by Mercury’s close friend Mary Austin. Highlights include the last work of art Mercury bought, James Jacques Tissot’s painting “Type of Beauty” (1880; est £400,000-£600,000), which hung in his drawing room at his Garden Lodge home in Kensington. Mercury, a Japanophile, also amassed classic works such as the woodblock print “Sudden Shower over the Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake” (1857, est £30,000-£50,000) by Utagawa Hiroshige. Austin will be donating a portion of the sale proceeds to the Mercury Phoenix Trust and the Elton John Aids Foundation.

"City braces for tighter regulation after banking turmoil ","The failures of SVB and Credit Suisse could pause plans to water down post-crisis rules","City bosses are bracing for tighter oversight in the wake of the most dramatic bank collapses since the financial crisis, even as the UK government doubles down on its vision for bolstering London’s competitiveness by rewriting its financial services rule book.  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the House of Lords last week that the government would push ahead with plans to reinvigorate the City through rule changes known as the Edinburgh reforms, widely seen as a regulatory easing.  “Sticking with the status quo is not necessarily the best thing to do to ensure financial stability,” Hunt said, the day after Credit Suisse’s shotgun marriage with UBS marked one of the world’s biggest bank failures in history.   “We should make sure that we get the right balance between stability and growth potential.”  The Edinburgh package includes overhauling London’s listing regime, liberalising what insurers can invest in, and reviewing some post-crisis regulations such as ringfencing measures — which forced separation of retail banking and trading — and rules to improve accountability and culture across City firms.  The Bank of England has separately promised a new “strong and simple” regime to deliver more “proportionate” regulation to banks with assets of less than £20bn.  A senior policy figure at one large bank said that the reforms’ impact could now be damped, even if the Treasury could not pull back from the Edinburgh programme because it was a “core feature” of the government’s goal of boosting UK productivity and growth.  “I suspect its ‘competitiveness’ agenda will now be more forcefully challenged by the regulators, who have some data points now to press for higher liquidity and even capital numbers.” His point was echoed by David Postings, chief executive of bank trade association UK Finance, who said recent “turmoil” could “give regulators more confidence in terms of the discussions [with government]”, and another lobbyist who said he would be “amazed” if regulators did not capitalise on recent events to push back against any loosening of the rule book.   The BoE’s governor, Andrew Bailey, publicly warned the government in December not to forget the lessons of the financial crisis, and has pushed back particularly strongly on insurance capital reforms. A policy chief at a second large bank said the promised reviews of ringfencing and accountability rules known as the senior managers regime were likely to be less enthusiastically pursued now. “They will be less aggressive on any roll back because in a time of crisis you don’t want to be seen to be lenient on banks.”  One senior UK insurance executive said the failure of Silicon Valley Bank — a midsize US lender to the tech industry — and Credit Suisse had triggered concerns that regulators could “reverse-ferret” over proposed loosening to EU insurance rules known as Solvency II. But they added policymakers had given no such signals, and the “idiosyncratic” and non-UK origins of the bank problems made it a remote possibility for now. Meanwhile, British watchdogs are expected to become more cautious in their supervisory approach and in rule changes within their gift.  Under the banner “strong and simple”, UK banking supervisors have been promising a more “proportionate” regime for small and midsized lenders deemed not to pose a risk to the entire system.  The US undertook a similarly intentioned — though more sweeping — initiative from 2018 by exempting banks with less than $250bn in assets from global capital rules and resolution planning. The list of exempted lenders included SVB.   It was SVB’s implosion that sparked a global market panic that has already claimed Signature Bank and Credit Suisse, and imperilled a third US non-systemic lender, First Republic.  The UK’s strong and simple proposals “are still only at the consultation stage, so the [Prudential Regulation Authority] does have the flexibility to pause and take stock of how recent events may impact its proposals,” said Jake Ghanty, financial regulatory partner at Wedlake Bell, adding that the PRA might now take a “more cautious” approach.  Postings, a strong supporter of the regime, admits the climate for introducing it is “perhaps more challenging now”, though he continues to advocate for increasing the threshold at which banks should have to hold loss absorbing capital to £25bn from £15bn.  Tighter liquidity rules are another potential focus. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you start hearing more noise on whether liquidity coverage ratios or net stable funding ratios are appropriate,” said one UK bank executive, referring to two of the critical post-crisis rules for mitigating liquidity issues.  The second policy executive said recent turbulence could also prompt regulators to push for lenders to use subsidiaries rather than branches, since the resolution of SVB’s UK arm showed how much easier resolutions were to handle in a subsidiary, which is a separate legal entity subject to tighter oversight by host countries’ regulators.  The BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority declined to comment.  The government said: “We are continuing to deliver the Edinburgh Reforms, which recognise the foundations on which the UK’s success as a financial services hub is built: stability, high regulatory standards, agility, and openness. “As the independent Bank of England has confirmed, the UK banking system remains safe, sound and well capitalised.”","26.03.2023"
"Rare good news from Credit Suisse with debt-for-nature swap deal","Plus, US pension fund Calpers takes aim at ‘greenwashing’","This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.Visit our Moral Money hub for all the latest ESG news, opinion and analysis from around the FT  Credit Suisse has struck a few fiendishly complicated deals over the past century and a half, such as the Mozambique “tuna bonds” that pushed the southern African country into a debt crisis. Its latest deal, the world’s biggest ever debt-for-nature swap, is much better for its image. The $1.6bn debt swap restructures some of Ecuador’s increasingly cheap sovereign debt while directing an estimated $450mn towards marine conservation in the Galápagos. For today’s edition I spoke to the president of the development bank that provided a crucial guarantee for the swap about his vision for more deals of this kind across Latin America.  Plus the chief executive of Calpers, the biggest pension plan in the US, tells Jo Cumbo about its responsibility to help stamp out “greenwashing”. (Kenza Bryan) The two banks behind Ecuador’s mammoth nature debt swap Credit Suisse has been in the headlines recently for all the wrong reasons. But now there is a more encouraging reason to watch the Swiss bank. Even as it is swallowed up by arch-rival UBS, it is becoming an unlikely leader in innovative deals that repackage emerging market debt in exchange for promises to protect biodiversity. After structuring and arranging the then-largest ever debt-for-nature swap for Belize in 2021, Credit Suisse said last week it had struck an even bigger (and more complicated) deal in Ecuador. So how does this type of deal work? Credit Suisse bought $1.6bn of Ecuadorean government debt from the densely forested South American country — which is also in the middle of a brewing political crisis. Then, buoyed by guarantees and insurance from the US International Development Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Credit Suisse swapped the bonds via a special purpose vehicle for a smaller loan at a lower borrowing cost of just under 7 per cent for Ecuador. What’s the link to nature? As part of the deal, Ecuador promised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marine conservation in the Galápagos. The twist also means Credit Suisse can, in theory, finance the bond purchase by issuing its own “blue” ocean-themed bonds, which ESG investors are keen to add to sustainable funds. “This is not an individual ad hoc deal,” Ilan Goldfajn, recently elected president of the Washington-based IDB, told Moral Money last week after the bank helped get the deal off the ground. The IDB is in active discussions with other Central and South American countries with a view to doing more debt-for-nature swaps in coming months, he said, after receiving significant interest at the IMF spring meetings and its annual gathering in Panama.  The current global macroeconomic conditions support more deals of this kind, he said. “We are in a period where we had the pandemic, the Russia invasion, a moment where debt and fiscal issues are at the forefront . . . at the same time we’re at a moment where there is a push for reforms of international [development bank] organisations to try to be as efficient as possible.” Before Ecuador, the development bank’s name has cropped up in some of the biggest deals of this kind. It provided a guarantee for a debt-for-nature swap in Barbados last year, and also advised on Uruguay’s $1.5bn bond issuance last year, which linked the cost of repayments to the country’s ability to reach deforestation and decarbonisation targets. Goldfajn said the bank had been investing a lot of resources in “financial innovation”.  A former governor of Brazil’s central bank, Goldfajn has more recently worked as an economist and director at the IMF, where he oversaw the launch of the fund’s first resilience and sustainability facility last year. The IMF has approved credit programmes tied to climate-change reform for Bangladesh, Barbados, Costa Rica, Jamaica and Rwanda, and disbursed its first payment to Costa Rica in March this year, according to a paper by the Centre for Global Development.  Goldfajn argues for more integration between development banks and the IMF, suggesting a joint fund could be created for guarantees for green finance instruments. Although the IDB focuses on development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the appeal of debt-for-nature swaps could fast become global. Bank of America is reportedly preparing a similar deal for the summer, a $500mn debt swap for marine conservation in Gabon. We also hear development banks will be looking to discuss this type of agreement at Macron’s climate summit in Paris next month. (Kenza Bryan) Calpers chief: Show us the climate data Companies prone to exaggerated sustainability claims are facing a gathering crackdown by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. They also have to contend with Calpers, the US’s biggest public pension plan, whose boss says it is determined to push companies for better information around climate-related risks.  Major institutional investors like Calpers, which manages a $442bn retirement fund on behalf of 2mn education sector workers in California, have come under pressure from environmental campaigners to take climate issues more seriously.   One of these pinch points has been “greenwashing”, or exaggerated claims by companies about their environmental performance. Asked whether large asset owners such as Calpers could play a role in tackling greenwashing, chief executive Marcie Frost said the fund “had an obligation” to make sure that the markets were pricing climate risk “appropriately”.  “We have been a very strong voice around transparency and around getting the data we need to price that risk appropriately,” she told me in an interview. But Frost defended Calpers’ decision to retain stakes in fossil fuel businesses, such as oil companies which deliver steady dividends. In California, there has been a renewed legislative push to force the fund to divest its fossil fuel holdings by 2030, a move which Frost said would force the fund to shed about $9.4bn of assets. “Walking away from the sector — we don’t think that is the right answer today for an energy transition,” Frost said. “I’ve got a group here in California who don’t want any greenhouse gas emissions in the portfolio. If you really take this out, there’s no way we could get to a 6.8 [per cent] return assumption,” she added, referring to Calpers’ annual target for investment returns. “We believe we have to be in with the companies . . . it’s going to take time and capital in order for these energy companies to do the transition to cleaner energy. Greenwashing can be real but if you are engaging appropriately with these companies to be more transparent, we see these companies actually provide the data we need to make decisions on their actions,” Frost said.

"FirstFT: Taiwan’s president meets House speaker Kevin McCarthy","Also in today’s newsletter, Trump rails against the US legal system and Dimon attacks US bank regulators","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will host a high-profile meeting with Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen in California today despite the risk of provoking fresh military exercises by China around the island. The meeting will mark the high point of a 10-day trip that has seen Tsai travel to New York as well as her central American allies Guatemala and Belize.  But only 13 countries currently recognise Taiwan and they are coming under increasing pressure to switch allegiance to Beijing.   Paraguay’s president last year called on Taiwan to invest $1bn in his country to help him resist “enormous” pressure to recognise China while last week Beijing hosted Honduras’s foreign minister for an official switching ceremony. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s former president Ma Ying-jeou has been visiting China while Tsai has been away. It is the first ever visit to the Communist country by a sitting or retired Taiwanese president. Today’s meeting will take place at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley in California and will be attended by a bipartisan group of 17 members of Congress. The deputy secretary-general of Taiwan’s presidential office, Chang Tun-han, quoted former US president Ronald Reagan yesterday as part of a rhetorical broadside that compared China with the cold war-era Soviet Union.  “Evil is powerless if the good are unafraid,” Chang said, quoting from a 1983 speech by the late president. China’s consulate in Los Angeles late yesterday called Tsai’s trip “a political stunt”, adding that a meeting with McCarthy would be “another serious violation of the one-China principle” and would “undermine the political foundation of China-US relations”.  China’s comments raise expectations of further military exercises to threaten Taiwan on a scale not seen since McCarthy’s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, visited the island in August.  Today’s Big Read is on Taiwan’s deepening political divide over the US and China. Here’s what else I’m keeping tabs on today: Macron-Xi meeting: Emmanuel Macron begins a state visit to China.

"Investors’ Chronicle: Vertu Motors, Compass Group, Treatt","Companies analysis from our sister publication","BUY: Vertu Motors (VTU) While City analysts have raised the spectre of price cuts in the sector, the company still looks well situated, writes Christopher Akers. The share price of Vertu Motors rose by 4 per cent as investors enjoyed the automotive retailer’s confirmation of record annual revenues, boosted by higher vehicle prices and the impact of acquisitions. The market also liked the news on the return of capital, with an increase in the dividend and a further £3mn share buyback programme. The much-discussed supply constraints in the car market supported elevated prices and boosted revenues. This was despite overall volumes falling by 0.4 per cent in the year, with used vehicle numbers down by 7 per cent.  Management thinks that “UK used car pricing dynamics are unlikely to change in 2023, even though average prices remain high”. The average selling price for used and new vehicles rose by 12 per cent to £19,987 and 10 per cent to £24,128 respectively, against last year. Whether such gains will continue to be seen is another question. Analysts at investment bank UBS argued in a research note last month that price cuts seen in the electric vehicle (EV) market could soon spread to traditional cars due to supply and demand dynamics. Watch this space. Elsewhere, there were positive noises on the integration of acquisitions, which helped the company’s number of sale outlets rise by a net 31 in the year and contributed £183mn of revenues. Vertu picked up garage group Helston in December, which the board still expects to deliver over £3mn of synergies in 2025, and also bought two BMW Motorrad sites.  This activity in the market meant that Vertu pivoted from a £16mn net cash position last year to a £75mn net debt position, excluding lease liabilities, this time around. But this looks manageable. Management is bullish that future free cash flow generation, which was up by £10mn year-on-year to over £54mn, will see debt fall back. On the costs side of things, wage inflation remains a key concern given that labour is the company’s biggest operating cost. Salary costs rose by over £14mn, year-on-year. While the company is not immune to a tight labour market, it is making progress on this front. Vacancies have fallen from the highs of over 500 last year to around 300. Current trading is encouraging, with trading profits in March and April up on last year despite cost challenges. And a forward earnings valuation of six times, according to FactSet, looks undemanding against car retailer peers such as Motorpoint.  BUY: Compass Group (CPG) The contract caterer has upgraded its guidance after a strong start to the year, writes Jemma Slingo.  Compass Group has had an impressive six months of trading. The company now thinks it will achieve operating profit growth of almost 30 per cent in financial year 2023, compared with its previous target of “above 20 per cent”. Meanwhile, organic revenue growth is expected to reach 18 per cent and operating margins are due to be marginally higher than anticipated at 6.7-6.8 per cent.  The group’s confidence is underpinned by strong performance across the board. All sectors and regions achieved double-digit organic sales growth in the six months to March 2023, and net new business growth was also well balanced, with every region growing in the range of 5-6 per cent. This is significantly higher than Compass’s historical growth rate of 3 per cent, and eases concerns that the office catering division would struggle in the wake of Covid.  Compass chief executive Dominic Blakemore believes outsourcing trends are working in the group’s favour despite “pockets” of macroeconomic weakness. “We believe that many of the complexities that drive outsourcing, such as increased regulation, changing client and consumer expectations, and inflation, are here to stay,” he said. Strong demand is translating into excellent profit growth. Adjusted operating profit jumped by 41 per cent year on year to £1.05bn — well above pre-pandemic levels. Statutory figures were damped by a £70mn charge relating to portfolio restructuring and £61mn of acquisition-related costs. However, profit growth was still impressive at 37.6 per cent. This, in turn, translated into excellent cash generation: free cash flow reached £590mn in the first half of 2023, compared with £360mn in the previous year. As such, the group has announced a new £750mn share buyback, and has raised its half-year dividend by 60 per cent.  With a forward price/earnings ratio of 22.3, Compass doesn’t come cheap, and there is a risk that the caterer is still enjoying a post-Covid rebound that will wane as time goes on. The group’s operating profit margin has also yet to recover from the blow of the pandemic (it sat at a comfortable 7.4 per cent in 2019).  However, margins are moving in the right direction — despite high mobilisation costs associated with new clients — and demand for catering services is building. Compass’s experienced management team and strong record are the final garnish. HOLD: Treatt (TET) The reopening of the Chinese market has boosted adjusted profits for the fragrance and flavouring manufacturer, writes Mark Robinson. As with so many other companies, Treatt’s performance over the past 15 months has depended on its ability to claw back rising input costs from its customer base. It’s latest half-year figures suggest that it has been reasonably successful on that score. The company recorded a 70 basis point increase in its gross margin to 28.2 per cent. Reported profits were down on the prior half year, although last year’s figures benefited to the tune of £2.72bn (net) from the disposal of Northern Way premises and relocation expenses, whereas the company was lumbered with net expenses amounting to £542mn this time around. By the onset of the pandemic, the company had already decoupled its financial performance from shifts in key citrus prices as it sought to reduce its exposure to the vagaries of commodity pricing. And it was the intensified focus on its value-added citrus products, along with nimble cost pass-through measures, which enabled Treatt to drive adjusted profitability. Revenue at the citrus business was up by a third, which meant that its share of the overall top line increased by 21.6 percentage points to 54.2 per cent. Sales to beverage customers increased through the period, suggesting that demand could be price-inelastic to an extent in this corner of the consumer goods market. Just under a year ago, the trading outlook had soured due to lower-than-expected demand for tea in the US, together with the severe Covid-related restrictions in place in China. Although sales in the tea category were down on a proportional basis, management expects that volumes will improve over the second half, while the reopening of China’s economy has seen sales into the region increase by 38.6 per cent. Further growth is in the offing through the coffee segment. Demand for the company’s natural coffee extracts only generated 2.6 per cent of overall sales, but the proportion is growing steadily. Management said that “although it remains early days, coffee sales growth is promising and provides optimism for the breadth of opportunities”. Treatt entered the second half with a strengthening order book and sales pipeline, but raw material inflation shows few signs of abating. There must be a limit to the extent to which costs can be passed on before consumer demand falters. So, although long-term prospects remain encouraging, caution is warranted until input costs moderate. We reiterate our previous advice with the shares trading in line with their historical average at 30 times consensus earnings.","12.05.2023"
"A fretful time for investors","Banking turmoil after the fall of Credit Suisse and US regional lenders leaves markets on edge","George Gatch, chief executive of JPMorgan Asset Management, offered a bracing assessment last Tuesday of his approach to global markets. Investors were reeling from the previous weekend’s emergency rescue of Credit Suisse. The bank’s shotgun wedding with historic arch rival UBS had been announced on Swiss television on Sunday evening with all the joy and fanfare of a wake. Only around a week beforehand, markets had been thrown into a spin by a series of failures in the US regional banking sector — a shock that had sparked an explosive rush to the safety of government bonds.  Gatch was not saying now is the time to panic. But by the same token, he was not taking any chances, telling a gathering of journalists that the asset manager had activated the “market stress protocol”. This is not something the investment house undertakes lightly. Previous activations have included in March 2020, when the global acceleration of the Covid pandemic hit stocks first and later, more alarmingly, bonds too. It also took this step when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last year. Now Gatch is seeing enough signs of fragility emerging after the aggressive monetary tightening that started in 2022 to go through the same process again. This involves putting around 22mn positions through what Gatch called a stress analyser. Portfolio managers, traders and others in the firm meet daily, rather than the usual weekly get-togethers, looking at flows and at so-called liquidity conditions — the ease with which trades get done without beating up market prices — to discuss where vulnerabilities may lie. “This allows us to identify where we need to pull back,” he said. “It’s as much about avoiding mistakes as it is about identifying opportunities.”  This sums up the mood among fund managers at the moment quite nicely. Investors are not panicking. But it is once again acceptable to ask in polite circles whether we are seeing 2008 all over again. Every single professional investor I’ve spoken to over the past two weeks has said “no”, and for what it’s worth, I agree with them. Still, many acknowledge that the echoes are strong. Anyone who has been in the markets for more than 15 years can remember that period when one after the other, small and seemingly insignificant subprime lenders that they had never previously heard of started to die off. Investors grew nervous but most failed to connect the dots. US regional banks now do not feel so different.  Similarly, cast your mind back to March 2008, when the swelling credit crunch reached the point where JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns in a speedy arranged marriage with passing similarities to the latest Swiss union. As the Financial Times reported at the time, authorities had pushed for the Bear Stearns deal to be wrapped up before markets opened on the Monday morning “to stave off a run on other US and European banks”. It worked. The S&P 500 index was nearly 4 per cent higher by the end of that month, and 12 per cent higher by mid-May. We all know what happened next. This time does genuinely appear to be different. Banks as a whole are better regulated, safer beasts than they were 15 years ago, especially in Europe. And yet here we are, with the continent’s bank stocks taking a seemingly unprovoked dive on Friday, pulling Deutsche Bank down as much as 14 per cent at one point in the day and pushing up the cost of insuring its debt against default.  One really important thing to bear in mind here is that European bank stocks have just carved out a massive rally — around 50 per cent from October last year to the start of March. That’s enough to lure in what many fund managers somewhat disparagingly refer to as “tourists” — short-term non-specialist investors who are as quick to get out as they were to get in.  “Investors that had not been involved in a while” entered this space, said Dublin-based Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at Amundi. The rally got “a little bit ahead of itself”, he said. That means it does not take very much to push stocks the other way. Still, the mood has clearly darkened and confidence in the banking sector as a whole is wobbling. “Everyone is a little bit on edge and there’s a bit of muscle memory,” says Elmgreen. “If you look at SVB, that was idiosyncratic. Signature Bank and Credit Suisse were idiosyncratic. But the market is trying to understand whether there’s a systemic issue here.” Elmgreen doesn’t think there is one. He says Amundi remains “positive” on core European retail banks, and does not see any fundamental shift at play.  It will be very hard for policymakers to hose this down. If they leap behind lecterns in an effort to reassure investors and depositors that everything is fine, they risk making everyone think the situation is graver than they previously thought. If they say nothing, they risk a snowball effect with self-reinforcing bursts of nerves. These are halcyon days for online warriors trying to stir up a global banking crisis, and wise readers would do well to ignore them. Nonetheless, this does seem a good time for “market stress protocols” and tin hats. katie.martin@ft.com Fractured markets: the big threats to the financial system ","24.03.2023"
"Recent bank rescues a ‘game changer’ for financial regulators, City bosses say","Senior finance figures predict the crisis will force a re-examination of deposits, culture and global co-operation","The fallout from the collapse of Credit Suisse and a handful of US banks will prove a “game changer” for global financial policymaking, forcing a re-examination of the role of deposits, culture and cross-border co-operation, City of London bosses told the Financial Times.  The FT’s City Network — a group of about 50 senior figures in finance and policymaking — made the prediction in response to a callout on whether the recent calamities should prompt policymakers to “rethink their plans for financial sector deregulation”, a reference to the UK government’s plans to boost the City’s competitiveness by reducing red tape.  “It is now much more fundamental than deregulation,” said Michael Tory, co-founder of advisory firm Ondra. He added that the real question was about the “sustainability of fractional reserve banking” that underpins the banking system by allowing institutions to hold some of depositors’ money in liquid assets and lend out the rest.   “We’re now going to have the debate that we did not have in 2007/08 . . . [when] there was zero appetite to force a wholesale change in the structure of banking,” Tory said. Recent events had proved that “a deposit base is no longer the stable source of funding that it has, by and large, been ever since the introduction of deposit insurance in the Depression”, he argued.  Credit Suisse was forced into the arms of UBS after a run on deposits so severe its regulators believed the bank was days away from not being able to honour requests from customers. San Francisco’s Silicon Valley Bank faced withdrawal demands of $40bn of its $170bn deposit book in the 24 hour period before regulators seized control.  Global policymakers, including Bank of England deputy governor Sam Woods, have said they may revisit liquidity rules designed to prevent bank runs. Woods told the Treasury select committee last week that they could not move to a “zero risk” system where 100 per cent of deposits were instantly accessible. Mervyn Davies, a former UK trade minister who now chairs LetterOne and is a senior adviser of Corsair Capital, said US regulators’ decision to rescue all depositors caught up in the recent collapses “changes the global game”.  The US controversially offered depositors of SVB and Signature Bank immediate access to their funds, including sums above the $250,000 covered by the US deposit insurance guarantee scheme. Regulators justified the decision on the grounds of protecting financial stability.  “If the largest economy steps in to save depositors, other countries will have to follow suit,” Davies said, arguing that “we cannot have the US going in a different direction to the UK and Europe”.   Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, also argued for greater global co-ordination following the failures in Switzerland and the US, both of which deviated from globally-agreed post-crisis rules on banking resolution.  “I cannot see how regulation on a nation by nation (or region by region) basis can sustain a global financial system without some very clear and shared global rules of engagement,” Drechsler said.  Anne Richards, chief executive of Fidelity International, also made the case for “revisiting” global rules around banking or crafting “entirely new ones” in light of the handling of recent failures. “It is pretty clear that the Credit Suisse rescue has set back the concept of prevention of ‘too-big-to-fail’,” she added.  Robert Swannell, former chair of UK Government Investments, said the “key lesson” of Credit Suisse and SVB’s failures was that “culture trumps everything”. “If regulators don’t feel they have found a way to understand and assess this aspect of banking yet, and how best to enforce it, then it’s about time they did,” he added. “I think this will be more productive than yet more complex regulation.” Douglas Flint, chair of asset manager Abrdn, said the failings at Credit Suisse and SVB were “basic and it seems recognised but not acted upon”.  “It’s not about inadequate regulation — including having the right people in management and boards with the right incentives — it’s about applying the oversight, governance and supervision controls within current regulation forcefully,” he added, decrying any “knee jerk reaction that there needs to be more regulation”.   The CityUK chief executive Miles Celic also argued against responding to the recent failures by rushing to draft tougher rules.  “We risk sleepwalking into an endpoint where our society’s default view is that no institution must ever be allowed to fail and that any failure is somehow due to dereliction of duty by the regulators and government,” the lobbyist said. “Such an approach is hardly one that will help us address the challenges of growth, productivity and innovation that exist in the developed world.” Stephen Jones, head of investment banking at Panmure Gordon, urged regulators to push ahead with capital markets reform rather than throwing it out “in the race to (rightly) debate relaxation or otherwise of bank regulation”.  Still, Flint and several of the respondents pointed to the need to improve regulation of banks with less than $250bn in the US, after the failure of SVB and other “non-systemic” banks shook confidence in the entire US banking sector. Those banks were excluded from global rules on capital and liquidity under a 2019 deregulatory push from the Trump administration.  US president Joe Biden on Thursday called on regulators to toughen rules for large regional banks, something that the Federal Reserve has already said it will examine.

"LatAm rates: early bird central banks should give a boost to bonds","For investors in local currency bonds, rising prices could come sooner than many expect","Last year, while the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank dithered over whether to raise interest rates, central banks in Latin America took the lead. Their tightening cycles are now at or near an end. For investors in local currency bonds, rising prices could come sooner than many expect. Policymakers know that “transitory” or not, inflation must be met head-on. Brazil began tightening in March 2021, 12 months before the Fed. From 2 per cent then, its policy rate is now 13.75 per cent. Inflation peaked above 12 per cent in April. In October it was 6.5 per cent. Chile tightened from 0.5 per cent in July 2021 to 11.25 per cent in October. Headline inflation has turned the corner and is 12.8 per cent; core inflation is 10.8 per cent. The central bank will probably hold firm until April.  Mexico tightened from 4 per cent in June 2021 to 10 per cent last month. Headline and core inflation are both 8.4 per cent. Banxico has signalled a further increase to 10.5 per cent. Brazil — where core inflation is higher than the headline figure and a fiscal expansion is expected — is the least likely to spring any surprises. The central bank has signalled its intention to keep rates high. No rate cut is expected before June. Elsewhere, stripping out volatile fuel and food prices suggests there is room to cut.  Manik Narain, EM strategist at UBS, prepared a measure of “core-core” inflation to gauge demand in 18 countries by stripping out services with high food and fuel components such as eating out and air travel. Brazil shows little change. Chile’s rate falls to less than 8 per cent. In Mexico, “core-core” inflation is slightly more than 3 per cent — less than half the rate in the US.  Narain expects policymakers to keep their focus on headline inflation. But if demand in Mexico is as soft as he thinks, bonds could be in for an early fillip. Ten-year local currency bonds were trading at 90 per cent of face value in mid-October. They have already rebounded to 95 per cent.

"Wall Street chief executives seek new plan for First Republic","Shares of lender plummet after rating downgrade despite $30bn lifeline last week","Wall Street bank chief executives are trying to come up with a new plan for First Republic after a $30bn lifeline failed to arrest a sharp sell-off in the lender’s shares.  The executives will discuss if anything more can be done for the California-based lender on the sidelines of a pre-planned gathering in Washington on Tuesday, which is being organised by the Financial Services Forum, one of the main industry lobby groups, said people familiar with the matter.  Investors have been concerned about the health of US regional banks following the failure of two lenders, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, in as many weeks.  First Republic shares, which have fallen almost 90 per cent this month, closed down 47 per cent on Monday despite an attempt by 11 banks to stabilise the lender by depositing $30bn last week.  That has prompted JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who spearheaded the deposit plan, to explore other options to support First Republic, one of the people said. One of the possibilities under consideration is converting all or a portion of their deposits into a capital infusion, another person said, in a development that was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.  “Those deposits are liabilities on the balance sheet — they owe the bigger banks money,” the person said, referring to First Republic. “If those deposits were converted to equity . . . it puts [First Republic] in a better financial position on a relative basis.” The FSF consists of eight banks, all of which contributed to last week’s lifeline. “The meeting this week was scheduled a year ago and will provide the members an opportunity to discuss the importance of our strong, diverse US banking sector, the state of the economy, and other important policy issues,” the FSF said in a statement. Citigroup chief executive Jane Fraser is expected to attend the meeting in person, as is Goldman Sachs’s David Solomon, the people said. The agenda of FSF-organised meetings is normally restricted to policy issues, but CEOs are expected to discuss options for First Republic on the sidelines of the gathering.  JPMorgan declined to comment.   The continued slide in First Republic’s share price on Monday came after its credit rating was cut for the second time in a week following a flight of depositors who pulled tens of billions of dollars from their accounts.  First Republic bonds that mature in 2046 were down 11 per cent on Monday, trading at about 55 cents on the dollar. They traded above 75 cents as recently as early March. S&P Global, on Sunday, downgraded the bank’s credit rating from double B plus to B plus — its second cut in a week — saying the $30bn lifeline from large US banks “should ease near-term liquidity pressures, but it may not solve the substantial business, liquidity, funding and profitability challenges that we believe the bank is now likely facing”. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank as well as other regionals have had a rush of deposit withdrawals in search of safety, expedited in an era of digital banking. Many of those deposits have flowed to the biggest US banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citi. First Republic, which is battling to restore investor confidence, has lost about $70bn of deposits since the start of the year when they totalled $176.4bn, said one person briefed on the matter. The withdrawal figures were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.  The outflows have, however, slowed since First Republic announced the $30bn in financial aid from the US banks, the Financial Times reported on Friday.   First Republic on Sunday said the bank was “well positioned” to cover any short-term deposit activity.  Signature had lost $50bn in deposits, or nearly 60 per cent of money in the bank’s accounts, since the beginning of the year, according to numbers revealed on Monday from New York Community Bank, which is acquiring nearly all of the failed bank’s operations. Signature’s deposits totalled $88bn at the end of December.  NYCB said deposit outflow from Signature had been significant, but had “stabilised” in the past week. US regulators guaranteed Signature deposits after it was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. NYCB shares were trading up more than 30 per cent following the deal announcement. At SVB, customers withdrew $42bn, a quarter of its total deposits, in the bank’s final day of operations, underscoring the swifter nature of a bank run when customers can pull money electronically.  Still, broader US market indices were slightly higher on Monday after the forced takeover of Credit Suisse by its local rival UBS showed that European authorities were acting decisively to prevent global contagion.  US authorities over the weekend also tried to calm fears about the health of regional banks, saying the outflows of deposits had slowed. The share prices of most regional banks that came under pressure last week were flat or higher, though they remain well below the levels before the recent banking turmoil.  Camden Fine, a bank industry consultant and former head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said despite outflows at the larger regionals, the conditions at smaller banks seem to be stabilising.  “I have talked to dozens of community bank CEOs, and believe it or not in every case they have seen an inflow of deposits in the past week,” said Fine, who tends to work with banks with less than $10bn in assets.

"LA, Miami and Dallas stake their claim in the US art market","New York galleries are opening locations around the country as local collector bases appeal","“Ten years ago, it was sort of frowned upon if you were a gallery outside cities like New York or London,” says Miami gallerist Nina Johnson, “but now the script has completely flipped. We’re seeing a lot of those people more frequently, physically in the gallery.” As a result of major tech and finance companies either working remotely during the pandemic or relocating to Florida for its favourable tax laws, she witnessed a surge in former New Yorkers and Californians moving to the city. Johnson even assembled a local culinary and historical guide for “clients and prospective clients”, she says, who had recently arrived from abroad or out of state. ‘Written in the Sky’ (2022) by Naudline Pierre is at James Cohan during Frieze New York © Naudline Pierre.

Photo: Phoebe d’Heurle As the latest edition of Frieze New York opens next week, New York City remains the art-world capital of the US, with 37 per cent of the country’s commercial galleries. (Los Angeles follows with 10 per cent, San Francisco 5, Chicago 4, Miami 3 and Boston and Dallas both 2, according to a UBS study from 2022.) But as the result of pandemic-era migration among wealthy individuals, both regional and international dealers have been rethinking their approach in these cities and increasing their flexibility.  Early on in the pandemic, even as many Americans struggled economically, wealthy individuals were able to retreat from major cities to their vacation homes, and top-tier galleries were quick to follow. Aspen pop-ups from Lehmann Maupin, Almine Rech and Galeria Mascota, as well as Hamptons outposts of Pace, Lisson and Michael Werner, have all since run their course — not all having found it easy to sell there. In Aspen, “collectors were more interested in browsing and less focused on buying,” says one dealer speaking anonymously. “Closing the deal proved to be more challenging.” Acquavella in Palm Beach is currently showing ‘Bed’ (2022) by Makoto Saito  © Courtesy Acquavella Galleries/Taka Ishii Gallery. Photo: Silvia Ros Two hours north of Miami, the ultra-wealthy vacation hub of Palm Beach, Florida, yielded a different outcome, where pandemic-era extensions of Pace, Acquavella, White Cube, Lehmann Maupin and more continue to flourish. “Sales spiked in 2020 and 2021, and while some of that buying craze has tapered a bit,” says Lehmann Maupin partner Carla Camacho, “east-coast collectors who initially ‘wintered’ there are now full-time Florida residents.” It was no coincidence that companies such as Goldman Sachs, Citadel and BlackRock had also moved into nearby West Palm Beach in droves, earning the area the title of “Wall Street South”.  The population of Florida grew by 707,000 between 2020 to 2022, according to US Census data, just as California and New York shrank by more than half a million each. Reasons for these moves were myriad, whether it was a desire for larger, more affordable housing; conservative politics; or more lenient tax laws. While these moves coincided with “a sharp increase” in sales for David Castillo, the longtime Miami gallerist attributes his uptick in business to his existing collectors’ newfound enthusiasm for buying “via images”, ie digitally. “As for new Miami residents,” he adds, cultivating new client relationships “is always a slower process”. ‘I Spy Taxidermy Birds’ (2022) by Anna Valdez © Courtesy the artist/OCHI Gallery Away from the coasts, back-to-back April fairs Expo Chicago and Dallas Art Fair play to different strengths. Expo Chicago director of programming Kate Sierzputowski describes her city as “institutionally aligned”, citing its historical foundation of museums, art schools and artist-run spaces. Dallas, meanwhile, is home to “major players”, says LA gallerist François Ghebaly, referring to its robust community of world-renowned collectors. Texas grew by almost 900,000 from 2020 to 2022, with notable corporate arrivals including Tesla, Hewlett-Packard and other Silicon Valley operations. Consequently, “we’re seeing high-level collectors moving in from both coasts,” says Dallas Art Fair director Kelly Cornell. “We had a whole year of engagement prior to the fair, making sure we were bringing them in.” There’s been a small influx of galleries, including LA’s Various Small Fires and Meliksetian Briggs, both of which already had connections to the area. And in April James Cope of And Now gallery launched Dallas Invitational, the city’s first satellite fair. “It was all familiar faces, and that’s a good thing,” he says, echoing Castillo’s sentiments. “My business is based on relationships I’ve developed over the past 20 years, not transplants who have moved to Dallas in the last two to three.” ‘Friday’ (1978) . . .  . . .and ‘Saturday’ (1978) by Carmen Herrera at Lisson Gallery  © Carmen Herrera. Courtesy Lisson Gallery (2) The most dramatic shift in the US art economy is now taking place in Los Angeles, where top-tier galleries including Marian Goodman, David Zwirner, Sean Kelly and Lisson are opening for the first time. Locally established galleries such as Night, François Ghebaly and Hauser & Wirth are also expanding within the city. Dealers have described young tech employees decamping from the Bay Area as an expansion of LA’s collector base, but Ghebaly has seen few changes in his clientele. “What has changed is that the industry as a whole has been thriving,” he says.   Huge pandemic sales were driven in part by “wild speculation with emerging artists” as well as the speed and convenience of remote transactions, says Gagosian Beverly Hills director Harmony Murphy. Stuck at home, “collectors began to trust the online process of Zoom and FaceTime viewings,” adds New York-based art adviser Jessica Arb Danial. ‘Gold’ (2016) by Nan Goldin © Nan Goldin. Courtesy the artist/Gagosian The booming market positioned dealers across the board for expansion, and LA was ideal for a variety of reasons. The city boasts countless artists awaiting representation, an established collector base and accessibility from all over the world. “New galleries are not just here to rely on Los Angeles and the local ecosystem, but as part of a global strategy,” says Ghebaly. Further up the coast, both Gagosian and Pace closed their Bay Area locations to concentrate their west-coast operations in LA. Despite this, and the recent closure of the San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco gallerist Micki Meng says media reports of doom and gloom are largely exaggerated; she points to the recent opening of both ICA San Francisco and her own second location as evidence. “Some of the best collections in the US are in San Francisco,” adds Sean Kelly partner Thomas Kelly, “and those people haven’t left.” Whether millennial “buyers” from the tech industry mature into “collectors”, adds one LA dealer, has yet to be confirmed. As business as usual resumes, “people are still buying a lot of art, but with a caution that was sort of lost during the frenzy of the pandemic,” says Murphy. Cities are also facing the effects of the migration of wealth in an already precarious economy. One Dallas dealer laments a newfound scarcity of dinner reservations and — on a more serious note — the rising cost of housing.   Still, since former Angelenos Anna Meliksetian and Michael Briggs opened their eponymous gallery in Dallas in January, they’ve experienced the utmost hospitality, says Briggs, as well as “an incredible hunger for new art.” They moved after the lease on their decade-old LA space had expired and found that in Dallas, “you get more bang for your buck.” They hope eventually to find an LA space that’s both affordable and suitable in order to be closer to their artists, but “with the New York galleries coming in, demand for spaces is high”, Briggs says. “We’ll just let things simmer down, and try to find something a little down the road.”","12.05.2023"
"We are living through a trillion-dollar rebalancing","Beneath a veil of silence, a hugely dramatic and powerful episode of financial repression is ongoing","The writer is an FT contributing editor and writes the Chartbook newsletter Faced with a rash of banking crises it is tempting to declare, plus ça change. There is nothing more inevitable than death, taxes and bank failures. But what about the bailouts? The publicly subsidised takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS and the hasty extension of guarantees to all SVB’s depositors are just the latest in a recent series of such actions. They suggest that we have entered a new era, one in which thoroughgoing liquidation of financial bubbles is politically unthinkable and so moral hazard and zombie balance sheets pile up. Both these interpretations are superficially plausible. Put them together and you have a vision of ever larger balance sheets, inevitable crisis and no less inevitable bailout, opening the path to even greater leverage and risk.  But in focusing on the morality play of bad bank managers and lax supervision, they mischaracterise the drama we are living through. What defines our current moment is neither the bank failures nor the relatively modest bailouts, but the astonishing macro-financial switchback of 2020-23. This began with mega-quantitative easing in response to the truly unprecedented shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. The combination of stimulus, supply-chain disruption and Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine unleashed the biggest surge in inflation in half a century, which was met not with monetary easing, but with the most comprehensive tightening of monetary policy since the beginning of the fiat money era. This is not a case of “plus ça change” but of polycrisis. We would not be here but for the pandemic. And the central bank response too is novel. They are doing what is necessary to stave off further contagion from SVB, but on rates they are sticking to their guns. Since early 2022, in the face of a market rout, the Federal Reserve has shown a resolve few people credited them with. Fed chair Jay Powell even half-hinted that a crisis or two might help to take the steam out of the economy. Certainly, those counting on the Fed to soothe their pain over huge losses on bond portfolios have had a rude awakening. Containing the fallout from SVB and Credit Suisse does involve some element of public subsidy, but those transfers are tiny in comparison with the trillion-dollar balance sheet shift from bond investor to bond issuers triggered by the post-Covid pile-up of inflation and interest rate rises. As David Beckworth, of the Mercatus Center think-tank, has pointed out, in the US the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product has plummeted by more than 20 percentage points from its pandemic peak. This spectacular balance sheet shift between debtors and creditors is happening as a result of three forces: the rebound in real output following the Covid shock, the rise in prices and wages, which inflates nominal GDP, and the downward revaluation of the stock of bonds as a result of higher interest rates. As recently as 2021, we were still worried about how we would cope with insuperable debt levels in a world of secular stagnation and chronic low inflation. Now the nominal GDP of debt-ridden Italy is increasing so fast that, to the third quarter of 2022, its debt-to-GDP ratio fell year on year by almost 7 per cent. Though no one wants to be seen to be celebrating the inflationary wave, we are, beneath a decent veil of silence, living through one of the most dramatic and powerful episodes of financial repression ever. This is what lies behind the trillions of dollars in unrealised losses on the balance sheets of financial institutions around the world. The figure would be even greater were it not for the fact that central banks, thanks to QE, are also big holders of government debt and are thus sharing the paper losses. Beyond the narrative of feckless banks and bailout-happy regulators, the truly systemic question is how we see our financial institutions through this giant trillion-dollar rebalancing. That is what will define this historical episode. Though debtors benefit from inflation and the revaluation of debts, they need to brace for the surging costs of debt service. Those who did not stretch the maturity of their obligations in the era of low rates now face an interest rate cliff.  But if we can adjust to higher debt service and avoid a rash of bank crises, the one-off shock to the price level opens up unexpected fiscal space. We must use this wisely. We need public investment so as to escape the reactive cycle we are locked in and to begin anticipating the challenges of the polycrisis, whether in public health, climate change or destabilising geopolitics.  We must also provide relief to that part of society which is least well equipped to handle these financially turbulent times. Those in the bottom half of income and wealth distribution are bystanders in the great balance-sheet reshuffle. They hold few, if any, financial assets and pay relatively little tax. They have lived the drama of Covid and its aftermath as a shock to jobs and a cost of living crisis. Unlike bondholders or investors, their interests are not represented by lobbyists. Their households are not too big to fail. But if those who run the system imagine they can be ignored, that they are not systemically important, those elites should not be surprised by the strike waves and populist backlash coming their way.","31.03.2023"
"‘Colossal’ central bank buying drives gold demand to decade high","Fallout from US sanctions on Russia helped fuel 18 per cent leap in purchases last year","Demand for gold surged to its highest in more than a decade in 2022, fuelled by “colossal” central bank purchases that underscored the safe haven asset’s appeal during times of geopolitical upheaval. Annual gold demand increased 18 per cent last year to 4,741 tonnes, the largest amount since 2011, driven by a 55-year high in central bank purchases, according to the World Gold Council, an industry-backed group.  Central banks hoovered up gold at a historic rate in the second half of the year, a move many analysts attribute to a desire to diversify reserves away from the dollar after the US froze Russia’s reserves denominated in the currency as part of its sanctions against Moscow. Retail investors also piled into the yellow metal in a bid to protect themselves from high inflation.  Central bank purchases of gold hit 417 tonnes in the final three months of the year, roughly 12 times higher than the same quarter a year ago. It took the annual total to more than double of the previous year at 1,136 tonnes.  Krishan Gopaul, senior analyst at the WGC, said “colossal” central bank buying is a “huge positive for the gold market”, even as the industry group predicted that it would be tough to match last year’s purchases because of a slow down in total reserve growth. “Since 2010 central banks have been net purchasers of gold following two decades of net sales. What we have seen recently in this environment is central banks have accelerated their purchases to a multi-decade high,” he said. He added that a lack of “counterparty risk” was a key attraction of the metal for central banks, compared with currencies under the control of foreign governments.  Only about a quarter of the fourth-quarter central bank purchases were reported to the IMF. Reported purchases in 2022 were led by Turkey taking in almost 400 tonnes, China, which reported buying 62 tonnes in November and December, and Middle Eastern nations. Gold industry analysts widely believe the remainder is accounted for by central banks and government agencies in China, Russia and the Middle East, which can include sovereign wealth funds. James Steel, a veteran precious metals analyst at HSBC, said that “portfolio diversification is the main reason” for US dollar-laden central banks buying gold. He adds that “a key reason for choosing gold is that central banks are limited in what assets they can hold, and they may be reluctant to commit to other currencies”.  Demand among retail investors for bar and coins also jumped to a nine-year high in 2022 above 1,200 tonnes with strong demand in Europe, Turkey and the Middle East offsetting weakness in China where buyers were housebound by Covid lockdowns. Gold prices slid from a record high last March above $2,000 to just above $1,600 per troy ounce in November as rising interest rates led to outflows from gold-backed exchange traded funds equivalent to $3bn over the year. Gold produces no yield, dulling its appeal to investors when interest rates on low-risk bonds climb. However, demand from central banks and retail investors helped prevent the yellow metal sliding further and set the stage for a powerful rally since November.   In those three months, gold has jumped almost a fifth to $1,928 per troy ounce — its highest level in nine months — helped by the US Federal Reserve signalling that it would slow down the pace of rate hikes. The WGC expects a revival in gold demand from institutional investors this year as interest rates in main economies approach their peak, while falling inflation could damp demand for bars and coins. As a result of exceptional central bank buying and an expected return of inflows for gold-backed ETFs, UBS raised its year-end target for the precious metal to $2,100 per troy ounce, up from $1,850 previously.","31.01.2023"

"Deposit demolition derby ","The Federal Reserve is bashing up bank balance sheets","My fellow Americans, our long national regional-banking nightmare may not be over. It did look like the coast was clear on Tuesday, for a bit, after Treasury secretary Janet Yellen signalled willingness to support uninsured depositors at smaller banks.  But it’s another part of the US government that’s responsible for the scarcity of liquidity in the first place: the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been draining reserves from the financial system by reducing the size of its balance sheet. And an aggressive pace of rate increases has pushed up yields on short-dated Treasuries and money-market funds, drawing what liquidity is left away from bank accounts.   So even though depositors appear to have called off the bank run (for now at least), banks’ profitability problems aren’t going away. Barclays laid out the challenge in a March 9 note, which (reasonably) got lost in the hubbub of the run on Silicon Valley Bank:  With market rates approaching 5% for the first time since before the GFC and opportunity costs at their highest level in decades, we expect flows out of deposits to accelerate this year. This is consistent with management commentary from banks (see below). The speed and size of the Fed’s 2022 rate hikes may have created a bit of a recognition lag for depositors who may have been somewhat slow to react. . . We think banks will need to compete more aggressively to retain deposits with market rates as high as they are currently. The amount of deposits at US-chartered institutions dropped about 5 per cent between February 2022 and March 8th this year, totalling nearly $825bn, according to Federal Reserve data — and that’s before the run on Silicon Valley Bank. (These figures exclude certificates of deposit or CDs, which carry a higher interest rate and tie up depositors’ cash for a pre-determined amount of time.) Data for the week ended March 15 will be published Friday.  From Barclays:  The longer-term trend shows that bank stress is a natural side effect of the Fed’s policy stance, as Employ America argued Tuesday, even if panicky venture capitalists didn’t help in SVB’s case. As JPMorgan strategists pointed out last week: The tightening of liquidity conditions in the US banking system has not only been the result of the Fed’s QT program, but also the result of the Fed’s rate hikes, as those rate hikes have already induced a large $400bn shift from bank deposits to money market funds over the past year. It’s no surprise that the last comparable run on US banks was during the 1980s savings and loan crisis, said Greg Hertrich, head of US depository strategies at Nomura. After the Fed raised rates aggressively to fight inflation in the 1970s, the S&Ls’ fixed-rate mortgages experienced mark-to-market losses. Roughly one-third of S&Ls failed or merged between 1980 and 1988, in a slow-moving crisis. As Hertrich told Alphaville:  There were some similar concerns about asset-liability mismatch, certainly within the context of a Fed that was being very aggressive with rates . . . That is not a surprise. What might be a surprise is when there are deposit outflows as significant as has been experienced at Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and seemingly now First Republic. Usually it doesn’t move that quickly . . . If we were to use the S&L crisis as a historical reference point, I think one of the things that’s very likely, is you’d see more consolidation among the regional banks, and to a different extent, the super-regional and large community banks. For those who want to read more on the S&L meltdown, the FDIC has a good list of resources. There’s also a muckraker’s history written by Steven Pizzo, Mary Fricker and Paul Muolo right after the crisis.   One point in the literature may be important here: the S&L crisis wasn’t resolved until years after regulators first noticed the problems with mismatched assets and liabilities. In fact, the crisis was made worse by regulators’ response, the FDIC argues, as the US deregulated the industry in what became an effort to let S&Ls make up for the losses with credit risk:  Most political, legislative, and regulatory decisions in the early 1980s were imbued with a spirit of deregulation. The prevailing view was that S&Ls should be granted regulatory forbearance until interest rates returned to normal levels, when thrifts would be able to restructure their portfolios with new asset powers . . . Legislative actions in the early 1980s were designed to aid the S&L industry but in fact increased the eventual cost of the crisis. This time around, US regulators are addressing the central issue of bond losses, and simply letting banks of all sizes temporarily liquefy their safe-bond portfolios at par value. This isn’t really credit-risk forbearance, but it does provide significant relief from the double-digit losses those portfolios would have otherwise suffered because of the Fed’s recent rate hikes.  The outlook for the liability side of banks’ balance sheets is less certain. The government hasn’t directly pledged to cover all uninsured deposits, even if regulators have strongly hinted at it.  But the possibility of an unlimited deposit guarantee raises another question: what even is a deposit, anyway? OK, yes, fine, it is money that someone puts in a bank. But as the financial system relearns every few decades, it’s also a maturity-free liability that can be redeemed on short notice.  There’s a reason First Republic shares didn’t respond much to last week’s “vote of confidence” from major banks in the form of $30bn in “uninsured deposits”: an uninsured deposit is functionally the same thing as a loan!   First Republic’s filing says the liquidity will be provided for 120 days, and “at market rates”, which could mean anywhere from its CD rates (which averaged 2.69 per cent in 4Q) to a spread above current short-dated Treasury yields, which are trading solidly above 4.5 per cent.  This makes First Republic’s liquidity infusion an excellent example of the problems with treating depositors differently to other unsecured lenders (whether by design or accident). For example: If banks decide to keep making giant interest-bearing unsecured loans deposits with one another, will those all be guaranteed too? In the wake of the Great Financial Crisis, global banking regulators took the potential flightiness/risk of deposits into account in banks’ Liquidity Coverage Ratio or LCR requirements, as Credit Suisse UBS’s Zoltan Pozsar wrote in 2016.  The largest global banks are required to hold a reserve of high-quality liquid assets to back their deposits, as Dan Davies wrote for Alphaville last week, with those deposits weighted according to their “heat”. “Hotter” deposits, which are expected to flee faster and in greater numbers in a bank run, require a greater amount of liquid assets. (Dan also noted these requirements don’t apply to small and midsized US banks.) Those rules provide helpful guidelines for those of us — Alex, Louis and every other millennial — who are still adjusting to a world where deposits yield anything above zero.  So, below, find a brief and incomplete list of US deposit types, rated on the highly unscientific scale of 🔥 (not hot / low run risk) to 🔥🔥🔥 (hot / high run risk).  We have included LCR designations — drawing on this handy chart from a UBS note — with a few extras, and are excluding uninsured deposits for now. That’s because uninsured corporate deposits were 🔥🔥🔥 before Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, but now that regulators are hinting at full deposit coverage, who knows?  Do email and/or let us know in the comments which categories we should have included, or if you disagree with our ratings. (Really feel free, because the author graduated university in 2009 and thus spent a full decade of adult life without ever Earning Safe Yield.)   Retail deposits:  This is money that a normal person would put in the bank — or in First Republic’s slightly riskier case, a wealthy person working with an adviser. Still, retail deposits generally aren’t especially run-prone, as most fall below the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit.  Rating: 🔥 Wholesale deposits:  These are deposits from companies, money managers and other institutions. They are rather more prone to runs, but regulators say their heat depends on whether the cash is going to be used for:  1) Operations and other day-to-day needs: 🔥 2) Investment, savings, nothing, etc: 🔥🔥🔥 Time deposits:  This is a category that includes things like CDs, where depositors agree to tie up their money for a short period of time in exchange for a higher interest rate. That means the funding is fully stable, but only until the CD matures, at which point there’s a decent chance the depositor will withdraw the cash instead of letting the bank reinvest.  Rating: 🔥🔥 Brokered deposits:  This one is kind of a puzzle.  A “brokered deposit” often calls to mind a CD from a treasury-management firm like IntraFi (formerly Promontory Interfinancial Network). That would fit into the “time deposit” category, though brokered CDs are seen as slightly less stable, because there is no direct relationship between the bank and the depositor, to the extent that such a relationship even helps.  Simple enough. But then we find footnotes like this one, in the 10-K of Western Alliance Bancorp, another regional bank that’s gotten shellacked by its shareholders:  WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $683 million of CDARS deposits and $2.1 billion of ICS deposits . . . At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company also had wholesale brokered deposits of $4.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. So they use the IntraFi network’s CD placements, and also “wholesale brokered deposits”? Bit confusing. That $4.8bn is around 9 per cent of Western Alliance’s $53.6bn total deposits, according to the 10-K.  Here’s how Barclays describes the rise in brokered deposits since the Fed started tightening policy:  These interest-rate-sensitive balances rose $150bn in Q4 22 and are up nearly 50% ($296bn) since lift-off. Combined, time and brokered deposits have grown to 13.7% (from 6.9%) of bank liabilities, while non-interest deposits have shrunk from 25.4% to 22.6%. Partly for confusion reasons, we will give them a rating of 🔥🔥🔥  To move on from run risk: Non-interest-bearing deposits are better for banks than interest-bearing deposits, for obvious reasons (the bank doesn’t have to pay depositors to hold their money).  So bank analysts will be watching closely to see how many depositors start demanding interest on their cash as short-term rates rise. From UBS:   . . . we looked back as far as we could to see where NIB has troughed, relative to Fed funds (see Figure 1). Going back to 1984 (10% fed funds), our data suggests that NIB troughed at 13% of total deposits in 1Q89 — when Fed funds was at ~9%. Our coverage is at 31%, and even relative to the ‘07 trough of 17%, this suggests mix shift will continue. As we said previously, it’s difficult to know exactly how quickly deposits are leaving US bank accounts. As our colleagues at mainFT reported last week, money-market funds saw the biggest inflows since 2020 during the run.  But the full extent of the deposit flight won’t be clear until the Fed’s next H.8 report, released Friday. But that will come two full days after the Fed’s policy statement, so the entire market could be different by then.","22.03.2023"
"EU ministers to agree on ammunition plan for Ukraine","Also in this newsletter: Italy’s new government tries its hand at its first major policy reform","This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday and Saturday morning Good morning. I am taking over the newsletter for the next two days while Henry is away. Yesterday, UBS agreed to take over its competitor Credit Suisse for $3.25bn. Shortly after, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other global central banks announced measures to increase liquidity as financial markets reel from chaos in the banking sector. Today, I preview an expected EU agreement on how to get more ammunition to Ukraine faster, and our Rome bureau chief has the intel on the Italian government’s first major policy reform. Loaded Faced with emptying armouries, EU foreign and defence ministers meet in Brussels today to discuss how to address Kyiv’s need for ammunition, and secure their own supplies in the process.  Context: EU members are supplying Ukraine with weapons and ammunition to support its fight against Russia. But as the conflict turns increasingly into a war of attrition, Europe’s stockpiles are draining fast and the domestic armament industry is struggling to restock and scale up. At the same time, the Ukrainians’ demand for supplies, particularly 155mm ammunition shells, only keeps growing. The ministers are expected to finalise plans to use additional money from a joint fund, the European Peace Facility (EPF), to supply Ukraine. €1bn would be used to partly reimburse deliveries of ammunition from countries’ existing stocks. Another €1bn should be used for the joint procurement of more supplies. While EU countries agree that the deliveries are urgent, some would also like to secure their national advantage in the process. France, among others, has insisted that the joint procurement should follow a “buy European” policy. This push appeared to be gaining ground yesterday, according to one EU diplomat, but still needed the green light from all European capitals. Who should be in charge of the joint purchase negotiations is another point of discussion. Germany is in talks with arms producers to expand existing contracts and has urged others to join. Others want the European Defence Agency to lead or at least be involved in procurement.   Meanwhile, the burning issue remains how to prop up the European defence industry in the long term. “There is no point agreeing these tracks separately, the whole idea is that they are all self-reinforcing: you need more capacity in order to have more joint orders, otherwise you just push the price up,” said an EU official involved in the talks. Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, is pushing to use the EU budget and the European Investment Bank to finance defence projects.  But that remains controversial, and while ministers will probably touch on the topic, do not expect any concrete decisions on this front yet.  Chart du jour: Hard row to hoe  Sustainable farming practices are widespread in Australia and New Zealand, while Europe and Asia are lagging behind. High fertiliser costs could, however, convince farmers to switch to more ecosystem-friendly technologies. Untaxing the rich Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has kicked off her first major policy initiative since taking office last year: a bid to overhaul the country’s notoriously byzantine tax system, writes Amy Kazmin.  But while Meloni is touting a “fiscal revolution” that will lower tax rates, simplify the rules and incentivise growth, critics say her plan will reward past tax evaders and widen social inequality. Context: Meloni campaigned last year on a promise to reduce Italy’s “suffocating tax burden” and usher in “a new era” in relations between taxpayers and authorities. Tax evasion is a major problem, with authorities estimating losses of around €100bn each year. The government’s ultimate goal is introducing a flat tax with a single rate for all. For now, it aims to cut the number of tax slabs from four to three, and reduce tax deductions. The plan also proposes unusual experiments, like allowing businesses to agree with tax authorities on their total tax obligation two years in advance — regardless of actual income — and reduces penalties for some cases of tax delinquency. Giuseppe Pisauro, former head of Italy’s parliamentary budget office, said other groups that typically voted for the right would also get more favourable rates, such as landlords paying lower taxes on the rent they receive. “It extends special treatment on categories that are part of their electorate,” Pisauro said. “You should move taxation away from labour and capital towards rents. This does exactly the opposite.” But there is still a long way ahead. Approved in cabinet last week, the plan now goes to parliament, with the promise that it will take effect within two years if it is adopted.  So far, markets have paid little heed. But given Italy’s precarious public finances, investors will surely be looking at how such a reform will affect revenue collection.

"Rules on listing Coco bond ETFs changed after first approvals","The two existing funds have suffered steep losses since Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds were written down to zero","Latest news on ETFsVisit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools Regulators appear to have got cold feet after approving two funds investing in the niche bank debt central to losses in the wake of UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse, but allowed the existing funds to continue. Two exchange traded funds, the €1.1bn Invesco AT1 Capital Bond Ucits ETF (AT1) and the $265mn WisdomTree AT1 CoCo Bond Ucits ETF (CCBO) invest 100 per cent of their assets in “additional tier 1” bonds issued by banks. These “contingent convertible” bonds were introduced after the global financial crisis and designed to limit the need for taxpayers’ money to be used to bail out failed banks. They provide an additional layer of loss-absorbing capital that is junior to traditional debt instruments in a bank’s capital structure but, it was widely thought, senior to its equity.   However, Credit Suisse’s $17bn of AT1 bonds were written down to zero as part of its takeover by Swiss peer UBS, even as equity holders shared SFr3.25bn ($3.53bn) between them, prompting an outcry from investors and concerns over the wider $260bn AT1 market. Prices had already been marked down earlier this month after AT1 bonds issued by Silicon Valley Bank UK were written off, although in that case equity holders were also wiped out. Despite recovering from their lows, after the likes of the European Central Bank and Bank of England reiterated their view of AT1 bonds’ place above equity in banks’ capital structure, the Invesco ETF has fallen 19.4 per cent since March 9, while the WisdomTree fund is down 15.5 per cent over the same period. As of the market close on March 17, the last trading day before Credit Suisse’s demise, the ETFs had exposure of 3.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively to the bank’s AT1 bonds, according to Morningstar data. Both ETFs are domiciled in Ireland and launched in 2018. However, in 2020 the Central Bank of Ireland, the financial regulator, issued new guidance for Ucits funds, Europe’s mainstream funds structure. This said that Ucits funds proposing to invest in contingent convertible bonds “may be subject to enhanced scrutiny at the authorisation phase with a view to ensuring that the proposal is appropriate”.  Cocos were lumped in with contracts for difference, collateralised loan obligations and binary options as assets requiring a similar level of surveillance. The regulator said in a statement that, in respect of Cocos “the central bank’s authorisation approach has evolved whereby any fund proposing to invest a material proportion in such assets will be subjected to enhanced review.  “Any proposal for a Ucits to invest a proportion of assets in such assets is required to make a comprehensive submission at authorisation stage which addresses issues around the fund’s liquidity profile and ability of the fund’s management company to effectively manage the proposed level of investment.” In particular, this enhanced review would consider how holdings of Cocos “will be managed in terms of overall liquidity of the fund, particularly given the potential for strong volatility in the liquidity profile” and the disclosures that would be given “in order for retail investors to understand the inherent risks in these assets”. European retail investors typically do not hold Coco bonds, and are barred from doing so in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, although it may be possible for UK investors to access the ETFs. Ireland’s change of tack came after the European Securities and Markets Authority said in 2019 that, in its view, “Coco bond funds are generally not compatible with the retail market,” with these “investor protection concerns” extending to “funds which predominantly invest in Coco bonds”.  “Manufacturers and distributors should therefore consider excluding retail investors from the target market,” Esma added. The pre-existing Invesco and WisdomTree ETFs were, however, permitted to continue operating. “These funds are grandfathered,” said one industry figure, referring to the legal exemption that can be granted for entities to continue existing operations after the imposition of new rules. The person believed the CBI’s revised guidance was a de facto ban on the creation of any new ETFs investing more than a small slice of their assets in additional tier 1 bonds. “The CBI changed the rules. They haven’t allowed any more AT1 ETFs, they will only allow people to put 10 per cent of a Ucits fund in AT1s,” he said. The figure believed the CBI had been wrong to change tack, arguing there are many other fixed income ETFs that hold “some pretty illiquid securities”, while theoretically riskier equities, even those in emerging markets, where volatility is typically elevated, are freely available to retail investors.   Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at 7 Investment Management, agreed, arguing there are many securities “wrapped up in exchange trade funds or notes that are not approved for retail investors such as commodities, cryptocurrencies and Vix-based ETNs, all of which are available in levered long and short versions” and all of which have proved volatile. Latest news on ETFsVisit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar, went further, saying: “I think it’s great that these [Coco] products exist, allowing sophisticated investors to make targeted bets very cheaply and efficiently.” Coco bonds are “a market that would once have been accessible only to the largest and most sophisticated investors globally. Now it’s also available to smaller institutions and other intermediaries who know what they are doing,” Lamont added. He argued that “much more dodgy” ETFs are widely available, such as leveraged and cryptocurrency funds. Lamont’s view was that ETFs such as the Invesco and WisdomTree products should be available, but that access to them should be policed by brokerages and other intermediaries, which should ensure that their products are suitable for their investor base, and that risk warnings are in place if these funds are available.","29.03.2023"

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: The trouble at Thames WaterM&A fees hit a near-decade lowThe insider trading charges tied to Trump’s Spac Thames Water swims against the current The UK has seen its share of asset liability mismatches, such as this past autumn’s liability driven investment crisis and the perennial woes of its property funds. But a new financial sinkhole has emerged in large water utilities serving cities like London.  Thames Water, the UK’s largest water utility, is facing financial ruin, burdened by an overleveraged balance sheet that has been bludgeoned by the impact of higher interest rates and a poorly-conceived matching of inflation-based debt payments versus incoming cash. The once stable utility that mainly serves London and the south-east of England, and was privatised in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher’s government, has fallen into dire financial health with the government scrambling to avoid its potential collapse. DD has chronicled the retreat of banks from the UK after Brexit, the trend of companies moving their listings to markets in Europe and North America. Now, there’s something else in the water. The FT’s Will Louch, Robert Smith and Gill Plimmer offer a detailed look at how a safe and stable critical infrastructure asset has been transformed over decades into a financial headache. The most pressing issues can be summed up as follows: Thames Water’s owners are reluctant to pump money into the utility when its previous owners pulled out too much cash by loading its balance sheet with debt.  Thames Water had expected current investors, including Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and the UK’s Universities Superannuation Scheme pension fund, to pump £1.5bn of new equity into the business to boost its “financial resilience”.  But those hopes were dashed when just £500mn came forward, leaving a shortfall. Cash flowed the other way under its prior owner, Macquarie. Earlier this week, DD dove into the Australian investment giant, which pioneered the infrastructure investment industry by buying assets being privatised by governments — often using debt. It bought Thames Water for £4.8bn in 2006. By the time Macquarie fully exited in 2017, it had taken out £2.7bn in dividends and £2.2bn in loans. Meanwhile, the debt on the utility’s balance sheet had nearly tripled to £10.8bn. Current shareholders may not fare so well, though. In addition to a debt pile that stands at about £16bn, Thames Water is dealing with a financial mismatch. The group’s debt is linked to inflation, meaning interest payments go up with inflation. It has justified that by pointing out that customer bills are also linked to inflation — unfortunately it’s the wrong kind. Debt is linked to the retail prices index, which is at a historically wide premium, whereas customers’ bills are tied to the consumer prices index adjusted for housing costs, which has risen less quickly. That has created a negative spread. Whoops!  (Alphaville breaks down the convoluted balance sheet in detail.)  The government is hoping City troubleshooter Sir Adrian Montague, who was named the utility’s new chair on Thursday, can shore up liquidity.  But, there is a risk it drowns under debt and financial mismanagement and there is already talk of nationalisation. Bankers forage for fees in an M&A desert A prolonged slump in mergers and acquisitions is hitting bankers where it hurts: their pockets.Fees earned by investment banks for advising on M&A dropped to their lowest level in the first half of the year in almost a decade, driving job cuts across the ranks of dealmakers.  Rising interest rates, stricter antitrust enforcement and geopolitical tensions are among the factors making it more difficult to get big transactions over the line. Or, as Latham & Watkins partner David Walker put it: “There’s a lot of headwinds.”Global M&A fell 38 per cent to $1.3tn in the first half of the year, the lowest deal volume since the start of the pandemic in 2020. That hasn’t stopped investors and companies from getting deals done, but it has forced dealmakers to get creative as some turn to transactions like carve outs or unsolicited bids to achieve their targets. The carve-out of a consumer unit from healthcare multinational Johnson & Johnson marked the largest US initial public offering in almost 18 months, for example, while a hostile approach from Swiss-based commodity trader Glencore to buy Canada’s Teck Resources for $23bn triggered one of the mining industry’s largest takeover battles in decades. Other bright spots have included energy, technology and healthcare. Even in these doldrums there is some room for optimism. Dealmaking rose slightly during the second quarter compared with the first, which was the slowest start to the year in a decade. And M&A volumes have held up compared with earlier prolonged slowdowns following the dotcom crash and the global financial crisis.“If this is the trough right now, I’d take this as a trough in any cycle because activity just hasn’t stopped,” said Oliver Lütkens, BNP Paribas’ co-head of advisory for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Digital World Acquisition Corp struggles to make Spacs great again DD readers undoubtedly remember the blank-cheque boom of 2020 and 2021 when everyone seemed to have a special purpose acquisition company. The listing of Digital World Acquisition Corporation got lost in the noise during the boom years, mostly for lack of a big name attached to the Spac. But it made a big splash when it announced a notable target in October 2021: Trump Media & Technology Group, a “rival” to Big Tech set up by the former US president. DWAC shares shot up from about $10 to a peak of approximately $175 following the announcement, but there was heavy trading in the company’s warrants even before news of the deal broke. Prosecutors seem to think they’ve found at least a few sources of that trading activity. On Thursday, the US attorney in Manhattan brought insider trading charges against three businessmen, including a former DWAC board member. The Securities and Exchange Commission soon followed with its own claim. According to the allegations, Bruce Garelick, who was a board member and therefore received non-public information on the progress of DWAC’s deal with TMTG, had passed information on to brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman and encouraged them to trade the company’s warrants. A lawyer for the Shvartsmans declined to comment, and a lawyer for Garelick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Michael Shvartsman, second from left, and Gerald Shvartsman, second from right, in Miami in 2016 © 2016 Getty Images DD’s Mark Vandevelde and Ortenca Aliaj profiled Michael Shvartsman last year when his investment company Rocket One Capital, of which Garelick was chief strategy officer, was named in filings as one of the companies a federal grand jury in New York was asking for information about. One of the interesting details in the SEC’s complaint is that Garelick had referred to DWAC as “the Trump Spac” in an email to potential investors in June 2021, months before the Spac had formally listed on the stock exchange. Under SEC guidelines, blank-cheque companies shouldn’t have a target in mind before listing, or be in discussions with any companies about a deal. Garelick couldn’t contain his excitement about the transaction. “Wild possibility you might get a kick out of,” he told his daughter. “Your dad might be named to the ‘Trump Media Group’s Board of Directors’.” He was less complimentary about DWAC, however, characterising his potential seat on its board of directors as “a front-row seat babysitting job”. While the Shvartsmans are alleged to have made $22.8mn from illicit trades with Garelick’s help, he told an unrelated individual who asked if he had “made out like a bandit” following the jump in the share price that he had to “restrict” himself on what he could buy, the SEC’s claim states. “Took one for the team,” Garelick later added.

"UK private wealth portfolios down by up to a third","Market losses, inflation and currency movements combine to hurt savers this year","The real value of UK private wealth portfolios has fallen by as much as one-third on average in the first nine months of this year as investment losses, inflation and the weak pound combined to hammer people’s buying power.  UK wealth management portfolios lost about 10 per cent on average in the year to the end of September, but price rises and the slide in sterling against the US dollar added to the damage, according to research by Asset Risk Consultants (ARC), which analysed the returns of strategies run by more than 100 large UK wealth managers. The figures underline that the tangible losses on investment portfolios are only a portion of the destruction of real wealth wrought by inflation and currency movements for UK investors this year.   “It will be very hard for investors to get their heads around the fact that they have just seen a third of their wealth disappear. That is a pretty bitter pill to swallow,” said Graham Harrison, managing director at ARC.  Harrison said investors tend to think about their wealth in terms of a fixed number and don’t mentally adjust when the buying power of those assets changes.  Inflation, which has shot to a four-decade high this year, means the “money illusion is back with a vengeance”, Harrison added.  The losses will make for painful conversations between wealth managers and their clients, as the industry responsible for stewarding the riches of well-heeled families is based on the idea of preserving wealth.  A standard wealth management portfolio would need to have been invested since 2015 to keep pace with the consumer price index plus 3 per cent, ARC found. This marks a sharp change from the beginning of the year, when almost all portfolios would have been ahead of that benchmark.  The damage to wealth management portfolios is in line with losses elsewhere. Do-it-yourself investors using Interactive Investor, an investment platform, lost about 13 per cent over the same nine-month period, while the MSCI World GBP Index declined 9 per cent.   Combined with inflation and sterling moves, investors across the market will therefore be confronting big losses in real terms.  The pound hit a record low against the dollar last month following the UK government’s now-scrapped plans for unfunded tax cuts. The UK currency is still down almost 15 per cent this year at $1.12, despite gains in recent weeks.  The weak pound has meant overseas assets are worth more in sterling terms, boosting the apparent value of British investors’ portfolios. However, purchases from abroad have become more expensive, weakening buying power and adding to inflation pressures.  ARC’s research adds up the combined effect on wealth of investment losses, price rises and the decline of sterling against the dollar. Harrison said the impact of the pound’s fall would appear both in inflation figures and the purchasing power adjustment, making ARC’s figures a pessimistic assessment of real wealth.  But Harrison added that double counting in the figures was minimal, and it was important to adjust for purchasing power to get an accurate picture.  “The sorts of people who have investment portfolios are also consumers of goods and services that are not included in the inflation basket, and those things have gone up in price a lot more,” he said.   Standard inflation measures are designed to capture the price of essentials, whereas wealthy households tend to have more international expenses, such as travel, and buy luxury goods whose prices are often based on the dollar, Harrison added.  Almost half of wealthy individuals have already cut back their spending in response to worries about inflation, according to a survey by Swiss wealth manager UBS. However, UBS said these investors “see hope on the horizon” as about 60 per cent are optimistic about the trajectory of markets in the near future.  Harrison said investors need to adjust to their losses, but should not overreact. “Don’t panic. Your wealth is only crystallised if you are pulling it out and spending it,” he said.","04.11.2022"
"‘Perhaps she will not spoil the atmosphere after all’: women mark 50 years trading at the LSE","Some of the first female traders recount how they started on the floor of the exchange","Janet McCall sparked a good deal of excitement when she took up her role on the floor of the London Stock Exchange in 1978 as the first female dealer at broker Wedd Durlacher. “Colleagues say that Janet is dark if not sultry, shapely and single, very promising and when it comes to business: tough,” one press cutting from the time of her appointment noted. “Perhaps she will not spoil the atmosphere after all.” Another article observed that the 22-year-old “pretty brunette” from Essex, who was joining a team of 84 men, did not have “a special boyfriend” in her life at that point. Wedd Durlacher was consumed by Barclays in 1986. McCall, now Stevens, went on to become a director at UBS. Today, women are represented in senior roles across the City, and language like that is bracing enough to make any modern reader wince.  Beryl Gayler © Charlie Bibby/FTInfoGayler during her time working at the LSE Info Beryl Gayler Gayler left school at 15, and worked for several years as a telephonist. “In the mid 1970s, a Laurence Keen dealing partner invited me to join the dealing team as a Blue Button [trainee dealer] on the Stock Market Trading Floor.“The first time you walked on to the floor, you thought ‘good grief, I can’t do this’. But after a while, people make jokes and you carry on. The firm was very supportive.“I retired in 2007. We obviously went up to the office with the Big Bang. That wasn’t nice. We missed the floor.“I remember at the time of my appointment, the dealing partner invited a retired senior partner to lunch, to break the news that the company had employed a woman to trade on the market floor. It was a very big deal in those times, and something I am exceptionally proud to be part of.” But the LSE believes remembering that time matters. This week it is marking 50 years since women like Stevens were first admitted on to the floor of the exchange that had been the tightly guarded preserve of men for more than 170 years.  “Change has come, but so much more is required,” said Julia Hoggett, LSE chief executive.  The journey for women on to the floor of the exchange on March 26 1973 was not smooth. Ranald Michie, emeritus professor at Durham university and author of The London Stock Exchange: A History published in 1999, said the council of the exchange put the matter to a vote among its members several times before 1973. “The council could see the need for change,” he said. But each time, it was rejected, by a huge margin. “People were inventing all sorts of reasons to stop them coming in,” Michie said.  Lindy Treacy © Charlie Bibby/FTInfoLindy Treacy, bottom left, on the floor of the exchange © S&GInfo Lindy Treacy Treacy arrived at the LSE in 1979.Before she landed on the stock exchange floor, Treacy worked at broker Mullins. “Mullins was the government broker. All the men wore top hats, so my first job in the morning was to brush these hats. After I’d been there for a year they had a dealing position, so [I asked to] be considered for that position. They said no because I would look silly in a top hat.“We were a minority, and sadly laddish and misogynistic behaviour was tolerated and almost encouraged. It was a challenging time for those who were simply seeking equality in the workplace.“I was known on the floor as Lindy Lou. There were other nicknames like Dirty Debbie, Sweaty Betty . . . some of them not repeatable. You had to be thick-skinned and you had to have a sense of humour.” Women were present in the City, largely as typists or telephonists. But exchange members threw up objections that, by today’s standards, seem bizarre. What if women used their female charms or short skirts to secure better prices? What if they were physically incapable of jostling their way through a crowded trading floor? “One man complained that if his wife came to the viewing gallery and saw him talking to attractive women, he’d be in trouble when he got home,” Michie said. But pressure for change was becoming unbearable. Before the first world war, London accounted for a third of trading in all securities around the world, including government bonds, Michie said. By the 1960s, much of that international heft had melted away. Both domestic and international listed businesses had often been nationalised. Calls for greater competition were building, and the London market was struggling to justify its fixed trading fees. Moreover, the world was moving on; the resistance to women was starting to look anachronistic.  The breakthrough came when 11 regional British and Irish stock exchanges merged — a step agreed by members in 1972. Exchanges in Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and elsewhere were all folded into London. Several of them, including Aberdeen and Huddersfield, had already accepted women as members since the mid-1960s. “Suddenly you had the prospect of these northern women coming to London and going on the floor, and you couldn’t stop them,” Michie said. “Women had been trying to force change behind the scenes” for decades, said James Taylor at Lancaster university. But the amalgamation — and successful legal campaigns for professional recognition by women in other industries — helped one aspiring floor member, Muriel Bailey, also known as Muriel Wood, to take a more vocal stance. She pointed out that female membership of some but not all parts of the combined group would create a two-tier system. Even then, Taylor said, “it still took months to face up to reality . . . It was performative misogyny. People were proud of having voted against women joining, it was two fingers up to public opinion.”  Sarah Danes © Charlie Bibby/FTInfoDanes surrounded by men at the LSE InfoDanes, highlighted Info Sarah Danes Danes joined stockbroker Vivian Gray in 1978, initially as an assistant. She became a so-called Blue Button, seeking information on share prices on the stock market floor, a year later.“It was daunting as there were only a handful of other women on the trading floor, with hundreds of suited men,” she said. “I was petrified. Luckily, I had a very kind dealer, he was very charming. His nickname was the Yorkshire Ripper. It was very male but not masculine as we think of it these days, not like football hooligans. They were always very polite and charming.“Nobody [outside of work] understood what I was doing. I earned very little money, I had to supplement my income by working behind a bar.” At the same time, inflation was on the up, and pension fund managers were mindful that if they were to pay out the sums that retirees had been promised, their savings pots would have to look beyond bonds paying fixed rates.   “Investors were looking for something that would hold value in an inflationary environment. Equities provided opportunities,” Michie said. The admission of women on to the trading floor helped them participate in this boom too, putting them in a better position when the so-called Big Bang of market deregulation landed in the 1980s.  Even then, women on the trading floor faced a tough task. “There was never any victory in allowing them in,” said Taylor. “This was not the result of a positive vote. Women were seen as intruders.” Three weeks after women were first allowed in, press reports show that one woman, on her second visit to the floor, was catcalled and verbally abused. “This hasn’t frightened me off,” she said. “I’m simply ignoring it.” All of the early female traders who spoke to the Financial Times about their experience of the 1970s and 1980s had fond memories of that time, despite their very different treatment to that of male colleagues. One, Sarah Danes, who joined the exchange in 1978 with stockbrokers Vivian Gray, recalls that she was not permitted to wear trousers to work until 1996. Janet Stevens © Charlie Bibby/FTInfoStevens at work © Frank HerrmannInfo Janet Stevens “I worked as a trainee dealer, a so-called Blue Button, on the stock exchange floor for Wedd Durlacher. They were one of the biggest jobbers, known as a market maker now, and I was the first woman they employed as a trainee. Market makers were on the podiums making the prices, and I was the first ever in equities. There were only five or six other lady brokers and we all looked out for each other.“I remember feeling a bit miffed at the time that the press concentrated on what I looked like, because I felt like it was an achievement.“I found most people very supportive, but I remember that you had to prove yourself. You had to be better than the boys.“In about 1984 I got headhunted and I went to UBS Securities to trade dollar eurobonds, and there again I was the only female trader. Now I am a trustee for the stock exchange veterans charity and I work in further education, helping young people understand what the City is like.” Women are still a relative rarity in trading roles. “Half a century later, our sector has not fully redressed the structural inequity and imbalances that characterised the experience of women — and barred them from professional growth in our sector,” said Hoggett at the LSE. Michelle Underwood © Charlie Bibby/FTInfoThe male-dominated trading floor © Steve Eason/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesInfo Michelle Underwood Underwood, then Michelle McAtee, joined stockbroker Mullens in 1978. In 1980, she entered the stock exchange floor while working for Charles Stanley.“It was quite overwhelming, because there were just so many men. There was so much to learn. There was always a sense of urgency, but it was very, very enjoyable.“It wasn’t well paid … When I first started I had to have a job on the Saturday and the Sunday working in the chemist. You were there to learn. You were expected to pick up people’s dry cleaning, get their sandwiches, all that sort of thing. But it was brilliant.“Everyone said ‘are you here to find a husband?’ and I’d go ‘no no no’. I met mine on a beach.” The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, said it believed “a diverse and inclusive culture results in better judgment and decision-making and encourages innovation”.  “We look forward to an open discussion on how we should use our powers to further diversity and inclusion within financial services, to the mutual benefit of firms and their customers.” Stacey Parsons © Charlie Bibby/FTInfo Stacey Parsons Parsons was born at the time some of the first women entered the LSE. She is head of fixed-income strategy at Winterflood Securities and has helped to organise events to celebrate the achievements of the first women at the exchange, and of the women in the City who followed in their footsteps.“[I want to] bring a broader awareness to the fact that women actually only became members of the stock exchange 50 years ago. It’s about recognising how we can look back to look forward.

"Bond traders set to test Bank of Japan ahead of key policy decision","Expectation grows among investors that Haruhiko Kuroda could scrap yield curve control measures","Traders have warned that bond and currency markets face a week of turmoil as the Bank of Japan meets for the final time before a new governor is named and confronts intensifying pressure to abandon its yield curve control policy.  The two-day monetary policy meeting will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the run up markets are considering the ramifications of Japan finally moving away from the ultra-loose policies that have defined its 20-year battle with deflation and made it a global source of cheap funding. The bank spent roughly 5 per cent of Japan’s gross domestic product defending its yield target in the last month alone.   Analysts said the likelihood of a major announcement at this week’s meeting is enhanced because Haruhiko Kuroda will step down in April after a record 10 years as BoJ governor. This meeting is effectively the last opportunity to crystallise his legacy. Traders are contemplating three possible outcomes for the bank’s policy path.  In one scenario, the central bank further loosens the target ceiling on benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds — a tactic it deployed in December which aims to address deepening dysfunction in the market.  The BoJ stunned investors last month by announcing that it would allow 10-year bond yields to fluctuate by 0.5 percentage points above or below its target of zero, replacing the previous band of 0.25 percentage points.  Since then investors have challenged Kuroda’s resolve, with yields on the 10-year JGB rising above the target band to 0.53 per cent on Friday.  Masatoshi Kikuchi, chief equity strategist at Mizuho Securities, said that ahead of this week’s meeting, the situation was “ripe” for a tactical JGB sell-off by foreign macro hedge funds that profited from the BoJ’s yield curve control revision in December.  The central bank has spent a total of ¥27tn ($211bn) in record bond purchases to defend its newly set ceiling. The bank owns around half of the JGB market because of its YCC policy, which started in 2016. Economists said that the central bank could double down on its December move and raise the 10-year yield ceiling to 0.75 per cent or as much as 1 per cent.  Koichi Sugisaki, macro strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG, said widening the YCC should reduce the pressure on the BoJ to continue large bond purchases, estimating that the 10-year JGB yield should, under normal conditions, trade around 0.58 per cent considering that the 10-year US Treasury yield is at 3.5 per cent. Citigroup economists have forecast a second scenario, of the BoJ completely abandoning the YCC. In doing so, Kuroda would spare his still-unnamed successor that task. “It seems better to do a major surgery under the old regime so that the new governor can conduct policy management with more freedom from April,” said Citigroup economist Kiichi Murashima.  The third scenario, backed by economists at UBS and Nomura, is for the BoJ to make no changes to its policy as it takes a wait-and-see stance until the markets fully digest the impact of its December revision.  “In order for the BoJ to formally end the YCC, it needs to reach a point where 2 per cent inflation is sustainable and when that’s the case, it also means that negative interest rates will no longer be needed,” said Naka Matsuzawa, chief Japan macro strategist at Nomura. “It seems nearly impossible to get all of this logic in place by this week’s meeting.” ","15.01.2023"
"Wall Street looks at 2023, sighs deeply","Pomo is the new FOMO","This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Happy Thanksgiving, Americans! Rob and Ethan are observing their patriotic duty to consume their own body weight in food, so this is Katie Martin writing from London.  Over on the sell side, it’s beginning to look a lot like year-ahead outlook season. I’ve read a heap of reports so you don’t have to. Summary: everyone loves sad, beaten-up bonds, and but not sad, beaten-up equities. This is weird, given that a recession seems a nailed-on certainty for next year. Bank of America’s investor survey shows 77 per cent expect one in the next 12 months. So you’d think this would already be baked in to stocks. Is the Street too pessimistic? Let me know what you reckon: katie.martin@ft.com Unhedged will be off tomorrow, back Monday. While we are away, why not read the FT’s excellent cryptofinance newsletter? You can sign up by clicking here. The most wonderful time of the year The race to send out the first outlook of the season was won by Morgan Stanley this year, when it grabbed the trophy on November 13. Congrats to everyone involved. Honourable mention to Goldman Sachs, whose US inflation outlook piece came out the same day.  As of this writing, Goldman wears the yellow jersey for total prognostication volume: more than 500 pages of year-ahead hoo-ha so far. The doorstop prize for longest single report to date: UBS Wealth Management, 72 pages if you count all the pictures of trees. Trees next to water. Trees next to roads. Trees covered in snow. Trees. A message of some kind? The best bit is that the timing of all these reports leaves a good chunk of 2022 left to play out. Nothing warms the heart on a winter’s day like a bank binning its year-ahead outlooks and trade ideas before the new year starts. On one level, of course, the whole thing is a giant waste of time. Did you have ‘Russia invades Ukraine’ or ‘massive deleveraging event by UK defined benefit pension schemes’ on your ‘things to watch’ list for 2022? No, you did not. So why am I reading them? Partly because I need to get out more. And partly because I want the answer to a vexing question: Everybody knows a recession is coming. So, are stocks ready? Will 2022 be less of a trainwreck? Here goes: Morgan Stanley. Nov 13; 63 pages; no pictures of trees but at least two of strategist Andrew Sheets’ trademark cartoons. 2022: How bad? This bad:  Oof.  The only people having fun in markets this year are running macro hedge funds with short rates/long dollar type positions. The good-ish news for everyone else is, Morgan Stanley reckons the S&P 500 will end next year roughly where it is now. The bad news: It won’t be a smooth ride. Consensus earnings are simply too high for 2023. We expect 2023 to be a rough start with a strong finish.We remain well below the 2023 bottom-up consensus EPS forecasts for the S&P 500. We think that it’s only a matter of time before earnings estimates fall in a more accelerative fashion that reflects the kind of downside expressed in our forecasts. The question is one of timing. Bottom line, our more recent tactical bullish call for the S&P 500 to reach 4,000-4,150 will ultimately roll over, with the index likely making this bear market’s low in 1Q23 as 2023 earnings revisions become more severe. UBS Wealth. Nov 17; 72 pages including trees. On monetary tightening, yes, we may be nearly there, UBS reckons, with rate increases likely to end in the first or second quarters. Indeed, “we think inflation should be close enough to target by the end of the year for the Fed to consider rate cuts”. The base case is: “Markets remain volatile and under pressure from inflation and rate fears, and amid weaker growth expectations. The risk-reward balance remains unfavourable, with stocks ending June 2023 around current levels.” In other words: annoying.  But investors probably just have to ride out this frustrating period. We think the backdrop for risky assets should become more positive as the year progresses. This means investors with the patience and discipline to stay invested should be rewarded with time. Investors currently sheltering from volatility will need to plan when, and how, to rotate back into riskier assets over the course of 2023.Historically markets start to turn between three and nine months prior to a trough in economic activity and corporate profits. With this in mind, a more constructive environment for risky assets should start to emerge during the year. Goldman Sachs. Nov 21 equity strategy outlook; 30 pages. No pictures. Bits here are from a range of its reports.  Goldman is still on Team “Softish US Landing.” The problem with that is: This central path now looks well reflected in asset markets, especially after the price action in the first half of November. But that also means that the risks on both sides of this central path are now less well-priced: plausible outcomes in which there is more inflation persistence, a slide into outright US recession, or— the baseline for many macro investors— both.So even after a long year of worry, the market remains vulnerable to bad growth and inflation news. In terms of asset performance, nope, not nearly there yet at all. And Pomo is the new FOMO. The bear market is not over, in our view.The conditions that are typically consistent with an equity trough have not yet been reached. We would expect lower valuations (consistent with recessionary outcomes), a trough in the momentum of growth deterioration, and a peak in interest rates before a sustained recovery begins.We expect markets to transition into a ‘Hope’ phase of the next bull market at some point in 2023, but from a lower level. The initial rebound from the trough is likely to be strong, in common with the beginning of most cycles before transitioning into a ‘Post Modern Cycle’ with lower returns.We expect overall returns between now and the end of next year to be relatively low.A weak economy that is still deteriorating is very different from an economy that is getting less bad. Generally, history suggests that the worst time to buy equities is when growth is contracting and momentum is deteriorating, and the best time is when growth is weak but moving towards stabilisation. While we are likely to transition into the phase of improving growth momentum at some point in 2023, the nearer term looks less promising.Our economists expect no rate cuts before 2024. Expect to be irritated. Credit Suisse. Nov 22, 67 (small) pages, lots of pictures of trains. Like the others, CS is expecting a good run for bonds, and a continuing mess in equities, particularly in the first half of the year. The environment remains challenging for equity markets, as we expect the nominal economic growth rate to slow substantially, thereby reducing revenue growth potential. Furthermore, close to record-high corporate profit margins will likely come under pressure and start to reflect various cost pressures.Consensus earnings have already been revised materially lower, but the current estimate of 3.7% growth for 2023 may still be too optimistic, in our view.We expect a turning point in the market to materialize in the second half of 2023. Until then, we would expect volatile but rather muted equity returns and would focus primarily on defensive sectors/regions offering stable margins, resilient earnings and low leverage. So, again, brace for a highly annoying year. Market analysts, we appreciate you, but this is a frankly depressing message.

"Risky US corporate bonds rebound strongly as inflation threat recedes","Rally in junk-rated debt drives yields down since start of 2023","Risky corporate bonds trading in the US have kicked off 2023 on an upbeat note, with investors tolerating a smaller premium to hold low-grade debt as evidence of cooling inflation mounts. Yields on speculative-grade US bonds have fallen by about 0.8 percentage points in the first two weeks of January to slightly more than 8 per cent, according to an ICE Data Services index, signalling a rise in the debt’s price. Borrowing costs for groups with the lowest credit quality have dropped even more, according to an Ice gauge of distressed debt, sliding about 3 percentage points to 19.3 per cent — a level last seen five months ago.  Those improvements follow a heavy sell-off in low-grade bonds along with other riskier asset classes last year as the US central bank rapidly boosted interest rates. This month’s move partly reflects a rally in US government debt, fuelled by expectations that the Federal Reserve will soften its stance on aggressive interest rate rises in the face of slowing price growth. The decline in benchmark Treasury yields has boosted the appeal of low-rated corporate bonds that typically offer higher returns. The gulf in yields between junk bonds and Treasuries has also narrowed since the start of January, in a sign that investors are betting on a more benign economic backdrop and a decreasing risk of default. The spread on US high-yield bonds has tightened by 0.5 percentage points since the end of December to 4.29 percentage points on January 12. The spread for the most distressed junk bonds has diminished by almost 3 percentage points to slightly less than 16 percentage points.  Matt Mish, head of credit strategy at UBS, said inflation had “on balance” been surprising investors “to the downside” recently.  Data on Thursday showed that the US consumer price index eased for a sixth consecutive month in December, to 6.5 per cent.  At the same time, “the growth data on net you could characterise as mixed” for the world’s largest economy, said Mish. “Which is why I think the inflation data, and expectations around how that flows through to Fed policy . . . is really what the market is focused on.” The recent trimming of credit spreads has come even as the Treasury yield curve — the difference between two- and 10-year government bond yields — remains inverted, which is typically seen by investors as a harbinger of a prolonged economic contraction. When a short but sharp recession hit during the depths of the coronavirus crisis in 2020, the US high-yield spread shot above 10 percentage points*. “I think it’s very hard to make the case that we’ll go through all 2023 without some significant widening in the spread,” said Marty Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors.  “I don’t think Treasury rates are going to come down far enough to offset a [2, 3 or 4 percentage point] widening,” he added, pointing out that default rates were expected to rise. “If spreads finish tighter at month-end it would be one positive data point for rest-of-year performance,” UBS’s Mish said.  Fridson noted that the high-yield market “does not have a great record” in providing a reliable alert well in advance of a recession. “It’s typical that people seem to stay with it, maybe overstay their welcome, figuring, ‘well, I’ll get out before everybody else does’,” he said. *This story has been amended to correct the unit of reporting of the peak of the high-yield spread during the coronavirus crisis.","15.01.2023"

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter The succession battle brewing at Morgan StanleySwedish gaming group Embracer loses a critical dealThe diplomat who scooped the Financial Times Morgan Stanley’s ‘three horsemen’ aim to demonstrate a clean race James Gorman would like his legacy at Morgan Stanley to be left drama-free.  As the Australian-born banker prepares to step down after 13 years at the helm, the Wall Street lender’s co-presidents Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein and head of investment management Dan Simkowitz are all contenders to fill his sensible shoes. Since taking over from John Mack in 2010, Gorman has diversified the US lender away from investment banking and trading with a push into wealth management that has helped it surpass arch-rival Goldman Sachs in market value along the way. The bank hasn’t been immune to the dealmaking slump, however. Its plans to cut another 3,000 jobs by the end of June are under way. Still, his reign has been free of headaches experienced by Wall Street rivals, including ties to Jeffrey Epstein, fake accounts scandals or criminal settlements related to the plundering of Malaysian state investment funds. (A $911mn hit from the blow-up of Archegos and probes into its block trading business could be potential blemishes on his record, though). His succession, he hopes, will go just as smoothly as his time steering the bank out of the wreckage of the 2008 crisis. “[Gorman] mentions it all the time that Wall Street has been absolutely horrific on succession and that he was the one who was going to change that,” said one former Morgan Stanley executive.  Two years ago, Pick and Saperstein celebrated their promotions to co-presidents over dinner at New York’s storied Italian joint Elio’s, vowing not to let the impending succession battle tear them apart. The coming months will put that pasta pact to the test. Pick is considered the frontrunner, said people familiar with the succession process. Although Saperstein was “much closer to James”, Pick, who leads the unit housing trading and investment banking, has built up his relationship with Gorman in recent years, according to one of the executives who has worked with all three of the men. Staten Island, New York-hailing Saperstein is also a formidable opponent given that the wealth management unit he oversees has become a crucial propeller of Morgan Stanley’s stock. Then there’s Simkowitz, seen by some as the most polished of the three. “He’s somebody I can see in front of a congressional hearing,” said another person who had worked with all three men.  Between the three remaining of the “four horsemen”, as they and departed Morgan Stanley veteran Jonathan Pruzan are referred to internally, it could be anyone’s race. Except — as their collective nickname implies — that of a woman. Twenty-five per cent of US “executive/senior officials/manager” roles at Morgan Stanley are filled by women, according to its most recent diversity report. Only Goldman had less, at 23 per cent, Reuters reported. It’s not all fun and games at Embracer In the popular board game Catan, players battle to see who can build the most successful kingdom on a fictional island. The empire forged by its owner, Swedish gaming group Embracer, is starting to look under threat. The company’s shares plummeted on Wednesday after it revealed that a mysterious partnership it had been working on for seven months (that would’ve brought in $2bn in revenue over six years) had fallen apart mere hours before it released its full-year results. To understand why the market reaction was quite so drastic — wiping nearly 60 per cent off the value of the company since the start of last week — one must first understand Embracer’s history. The sprawling games empire is beloved by local Swedish investors, but surrounded by foreign sceptics betting on its decline.  The FT travelled to snowy Karlstad late last year to learn more about the divisive roll-up and its Swedish founder Lars Wingefors, who explained his low-intervention acquisition strategy. Embracer Group’s revenue increased almost hundredfold between 2014 and 2022, amid a dealmaking spree that encompassed everything from large and small gaming studios to the US comics publisher behind Hellboy and Sin City to Catan and the intellectual property for The Lord of the Rings. Several hedge funds shared with the FT some of their issues with the company’s strategy and accounting, including the difficulty in assessing the company’s financial performance due to repeated internal reorganisations and accounting practices around newly purchased companies that may obscure the group’s underlying performance.

But despite representing past clients including Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law and churning out homemade Neapolitan delicacies, his true calling might just be journalism. It was the latter that brought the flamboyant diplomat to the attention of our colleagues at FT Alphaville.

"LVMH lifts dividend as record profits defy downturn","Biggest luxury group confident it can sustain pace of growth even as analysts expect slowdown","The world’s biggest luxury group LVMH raised its annual dividend by 20 per cent after delivering a second straight year of record sales and profits driven by its main brands Louis Vuitton and Dior. Owner Bernard Arnault said in a statement on Thursday that LVMH was “going into this year with confidence” despite the uncertainties weighing on the global economy, and added that he believed LVMH could continue growing as it did in 2022. Whether that prediction proves accurate will depend largely on how quickly China, luxury’s second-biggest market after the US, emerges from a spike in Covid-19 infections that began in December when the government lifted its restrictive policies.   Since then luxury brands have had to temporarily close stores and warehouses because of sick employees, which hit fourth-quarter results at LVMH, Burberry and Cartier-owner Richemont.  Once the Covid-19 crisis eases, analysts expect the Chinese consumer to resume shopping for high-end goods. LVMH said on Thursday that it had seen signs of improvement in China this month. LVMH finance director Jean Jacques Guiony said the economic outlook was hard to predict, but the group’s long-term strategy remained the same. “We work on our brands’ desirability so they can resist in downturns, and have learned to be flexible in a crisis if one materialises,” he said.  “Last year’s strong results, despite the war in Ukraine and challenges in China, show the resilience and permanence of luxury consumers and the strength of our brands.” Nevertheless, analysts are predicting a slowdown in luxury demand after two years of strong growth in which affluent American and Chinese consumers drove sales to new heights. Amid rising inflation and a risk of recession in the US and Europe, UBS estimates that luxury goods sales will rise by 9 per cent this year after expanding by 16 per cent on a like-for-like basis in 2022. The Swiss bank sees margins as remaining flat.  China’s Covid-19 spike dented the fourth quarter at LVMH with sales rising to €22.7bn, just shy of analysts’ consensus of €22.4bn. That represented a rise of 9 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the quarter compared to the same period last year, and a marked slowdown from 20 per cent in the first nine months.   Nevertheless, annual sales were up 23 per cent to €79.2bn, largely in line with analysts’ expectations, while net profit grew 17 per cent to €14bn.   The fashion and leather goods division, which houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, reported sales of €38.6bn and organic growth of 20 per cent. Although it does not usually break out sales by brand, LVMH said Louis Vuitton crossed the €20bn mark in terms of revenue last year and had doubled in size in four years.  In another sign of confidence, LVMH said it would propose a 2022 dividend of 12 euro per share, up from 10 euro for 2021, and 4.80 per share in 2019 before the pandemic. The two-year luxury boom has made LVMH the biggest listed company in Europe by market capitalisation, and turned Arnault into the richest person in the world ahead of Tesla’s Elon Musk and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, according to Forbes.  The 73-year-old built LVMH into a powerhouse through decades of acquisitions, including of US jeweller Tiffany in 2020. The group spans dozens of brands, from Moët champagne to Cheval Blanc hotels.  His five children work in the group, and he and the family own 48 per cent of the share capital.  A management reshuffle was recently announced when Dior chief executive Pietro Beccari was promoted to run Louis Vuitton. Arnault named his daughter Delphine Arnault to be the new CEO of Dior, the group’s second-biggest brand.","26.01.2023"
"Karin Keller-Sutter: the finance minister behind the rescue of Credit Suisse","Former interpreter faces fallout after helping to engineer the takeover of Swiss banking institution","Swiss politicians are stealthy by design.  But last weekend, as Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-largest bank, and a national institution, tottered on the brink of failure, Bern’s political leadership was uncomfortably thrust into the limelight. Karin Keller-Sutter has been in charge of the Swiss finance ministry for just two months. She now finds herself dealing with Switzerland’s biggest financial crisis in more than a decade.  In a few short days she has become a lightning rod for anger among certain sections of an astonished Swiss public, and the bête noire of angry international bondholders, vaporised by the rescue plan she pulled together, in which Credit Suisse’s fierce rival, UBS, was induced into a shotgun marriage using billions in taxpayer guarantees. For supporters, she has by contrast, with characteristic unflappability, forged a miraculous rescue deal combining two of the world’s most complicated financial institutions in just 48 hours. “Of course, [she] will be heavily criticised, but the reality is that the people involved were handed an extremely difficult situation, with systemic implications, and they had almost no time to solve it,” said the head of one Swiss private bank who watched the rescue of Credit Suisse unfold with disbelief. Keller-Sutter, or KKS as she is known to colleagues, is one of the seven federal councillors who sit at the apex of Switzerland’s labyrinthine political system, ruling collectively in place of a prime minister or a president. For some time Keller-Sutter, a native of the canton of St Gallen, in Switzerland’s east, has been the most popular of them with the Swiss public. Throughout her career, Keller-Sutter has stood for the FDP, Switzerland’s economically liberal party of business, whose existence stretches back to the bourgeois heyday of the country’s industrial miracle in the late 19th century.   Credit Suisse, founded by the liberal politician and industrialist Alfred Escher, was long regarded as the FDP’s house bank. The decision to use taxpayer money to bail out a commercial entity, even one with such close historic ties to her party, nevertheless “contradicts everything she stands for, everything she believes in”, the broadsheet newspaper Tages-Anzeiger railed.  Close allies say Keller-Sutter inherited some of her attitude towards business, particularly the importance of taking responsibility and keeping one’s house in order, from her parents, who ran a local restaurant. Though she may harbour strong views on Credit Suisse’s management on such points, another very Swiss quality she channels — a poised sangfroid — means she would almost certainly never show it, said one former colleague.  Many in the Swiss business community have long respected Keller-Sutter. “She combines financial expertise with a profound understanding of the challenges businesses face,” said Etienne Jornod, chair of the NZZ media group, one of Switzerland’s biggest newspaper publishers. Keller-Sutter used to sit on the NZZ board, as well as those of several other Swiss businesses.  “She was well known for her strong, well-considered advice as well as for her determination,” Jornod recalled.  By training, Keller-Sutter is an interpreter.  A native German speaker, she graduated from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in 1989, fluent in English and French. She later trained as a secondary school teacher. It was while on a term of study in Montreal that her politics — pro free markets and small government — became fixed.  A profile of her by Swiss public television observed in 2018: “Interpreters are service providers, they are at their best when their person disappears behind the matter at hand.” Her modesty and ability to listen have indeed been a hallmark of her career. But so too have her tenacity and convictions. Few know that she boxes in her spare time, and avidly follows the sport.  She bucked the pro-business FDP line during the coronavirus pandemic, supporting stronger social restrictions in Federal Council debates — perhaps informed by the first-hand experiences of her husband, Morten Keller, a doctor in charge of the Zurich city health department.  “Like my dog, I won’t be muzzled!” ran her first-ever election slogan for Wil town council in 1992. Women in Swiss politics were a rarity at the time. Wil is 25km from the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, where just two years before she was elected, women received the right to vote. Keller-Sutter rose steadily up the local political ladder in St Gallen, with what colleagues at the time recall as a remarkable work ethic, and by 2011, was elected to Bern as one of the two cantonal councillors of state — the equivalent of a US senator. By 2017, she was elected president of the Council of States, the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. Keller-Sutter commands respect from across the political spectrum.  “We have completely different political perspectives but she is very open, and always has a very clear line,” said Cédric Wermuth, co-president of Switzerland’s Social Democratic party. “She is pro-business. Pro-banking. But reliable and honest and doesn’t play games.” On the eve of her potential election in 2018 to the Federal Council, Switzerland’s highest office, Bern insiders recall an anecdote about her attendance at the Olma, a huge traditional agricultural festival in St Gallen famous for its Säulirennen — piglet race — and, incidentally, the attendance of Bern power brokers competing to demonstrate their earthy credentials.  While other politicians posed for pictures, piglets in arms, Keller-Sutter ducked the parade, having told her brightly clothed ceremonial beadle — an official that comes as a perk of the upper house presidency — to stay at home, and snuck off into the crowd, lest she appeared too prominent, and too confident of victory.  A different challenge now awaits her, however, in which very public leadership will be required to ease the fears and assuage the anger of a country still reeling from last weekend’s events.

"Fears for London market after SoftBank’s Arm and building group CRH opt for New York","Moves to list the chip designer and building materials giant in US come as UK tries to sharpen appeal","Fears for the future of the London stock market are mounting after SoftBank and the world’s largest building materials group shunned the City in favour of New York. SoftBank this week rejected a London listing for Cambridge-based chip designer Arm despite an intense lobbying effort from three successive UK prime ministers, said two people with knowledge of the discussions. The Japanese group has long looked to a US listing as the best chance to recoup the $32bn it spent buying Arm in 2016, given the higher valuation US investors put on tech stocks. Arm’s chief legal officer Spencer Collins had informed City minister Andrew Griffith on Wednesday, one of them said. SoftBank and Arm confirmed the decision late on Thursday, saying in a statement that they had concluded a US-only listing this year was “the best path forward for the company and its stakeholders”, while adding they would still consider a secondary listing in London “in due course”.  The decision to concentrate on a single primary listing in New York will be a personal blow for prime minister Rishi Sunak, who held a meeting with SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son and Arm chief executive Rene Haas before Christmas to lay out the benefits of listing in London.  Arm was put off by a rule that requires UK-listed companies to disclose all related-party transactions, potentially forcing it to report dealing with any other companies SoftBank has a stake in, said one person familiar with the decision. The cost and complexity of seeking full primary listings in both countries also led to the decision to pick New York, the person added. On Thursday, £30bn building materials giant CRH also set out plans to move its shares to the US, where it generates the bulk of its profits and expects to benefit from president Joe Biden’s plans for infrastructure investment. Shares in CRH, which has worked on large construction projects across the US, Europe and the UK, jumped as much as 9 per cent as analysts said the group would command a higher valuation in New York. Analysts at UBS said shifting the listing to the US could lead to a “multiple re-rating given US peers trade on roughly 25x [price to earnings] vs CRH on 13x”. Asked about the move by CRH, David Schwimmer, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, said: “If companies are going to make decisions when most of their business is in the US, that sort of is what it is.”  The planned exit comes at a difficult juncture for London’s capital markets, which over the past two decades have failed to attract the biggest tech companies. The challenge facing the market has deepened during the past year as a wave of listed groups have been acquired.  CRH’s decision echoes that of Ferguson, the plumbing and heating supplier formerly known as Wolseley, which last year moved its primary listing to the US. Flutter, the FTSE 100 gambling company that is pushing aggressively into the US, plans to establish a secondary listing in New York.  Peter Jackson, Flutter chief executive, told the Financial Times that if the move was approved by 75 per cent of shareholders, the company would “consider switching our primary listing”. Early feedback from investors was “supportive” and a US listing would yield “long-term strategic and capital market benefits”, he added.  Earlier this week, the FT also reported that Shell’s top executives had explored moving the Anglo-Dutch energy group to the US. Anthony Browne, Tory MP for South Cambridgeshire, many of whose constituents work at Arm, said its listing decision was a big blow. “It is a major part of our national security . . . but the problem with listing overseas is that where the investors are, the jobs and research often follow,” he said.  “The government has tried its best to get Arm listed in the UK but money talks: even the UK government cannot resist the powerful gravitational pull of the US stock markets.”  The London market has been hit recently by a wave of takeovers and take-private deals that have stripped it of companies including Aveva, Micro Focus and cyber security company Avast.  While CRH pointed to its expanding operations in America, the deeper pool of capital in the US is also a huge draw. Bloomberg first reported this week that Arm had decided on a sole US listing. The steady erosion of London’s status has prompted the UK government to set out reforms to safeguard the future of the City of London, ranging across banks, insurers, brokers, exchanges and investors, and aiming to redraw rules for asset classes from cryptocurrency to infrastructure and equities.

"Has the tide turned for Europe’s banks?","Despite rising rates in 2022, only two of the 20 largest European lenders trade above book value","2022 should have been the year that finally provided some relief to the perpetually troubled European banking sector. Instead a war, an energy crisis, recession and runaway inflation conspired to undermine the long-anticipated benefits from the first meaningful interest rate rises in a decade. As a result, and despite bumper profits across the region, investors have stayed away as pessimism about rising defaults and potential windfall taxes outweighed optimism from higher dividends and buybacks.  “There is still fundamental nervousness about the sector,” said Magdalena Stoklosa, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “There’s little faith that banks can rewire, despite the fact that balance sheets are solid, liquid, and very well capitalised, and profitability has improved.” Morgan Stanley estimated that European lenders’ pre-provision profit will rise 16 per cent in 2022 and another 8 per cent next year. They are forecast to return at least €100bn via dividends and stock buybacks from now until the end of next year, with another €31bn of excess capital to return more or absorb recessionary loan losses. Long-awaited central bank rate rises have juiced earnings through dramatic increases in net interest income (NII), as the amount charged for loans has risen faster than the rate paid out on deposits.  However, that windfall has caused little change in long-term sentiment.  The benchmark index of European banks has fallen 5.8 per cent this year and the comparable UK index rose only 4.5 per cent — both outperformed the broader stock market but on a five-year basis they remain down close to 30 per cent.  Stress testing the system As was true back in 2018 — seen as a post-crisis nadir for the sector — only two of the 20 largest British, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Scandinavian and Swiss banks trade above book value: wealth manager UBS and Finland’s Nordea.  But some suggest that the extraordinarily turbulent environment of the past three years should be seen as a stress test rather than a cause for alarm. “If you had told people we are going to get a war in Ukraine, recession, the LDI pensions blow up and late-cycle episodes like the collapse of FTX and European banks would still outperform the market, that is pretty resilient performance after what was thrown at them,” said Stuart Graham, co-founder of Autonomous Research. “2022 has taught us that we need to be humble,” he added. “It is a ‘show me’ story to prove banks are cheap. Many investors want to see it before they believe.” Bank executives from Barclays to UBS have been on charm offensives in the US to sell that story, promising higher payouts and strict cost controls. UniCredit’s Andrea Orcel has committed to return €16bn of capital to shareholders by 2024 as he seeks to boost the share price and win himself a pay rise. But the legacy of underperformance since the 2008 crisis has been hard to shake. In May, Capital Group — one of the few active investors backing European banks — dumped €7bn of stock after concluding the damage of a recession would outweigh the benefit of rate rises. “In the last 13 years there has been focus on remediation, restructuring and implementation of regulation. Capital and investment have gone to those rather than innovating and driving growth . . . [this] has left an enduring discount on banks,” said Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn.   “People look at us as a bellwether for the UK economy . . . If confidence is rebuilt we will automatically deliver a much stronger share price than we see today,” he added. “But there is a nervousness in investors about how financial services will be able to respond.”  Dark clouds Those who view 2023 with scepticism point to a likely surge in loan-loss provisions as Britain and the continent head into a cost of living crisis, combined with surging inflation pressuring their cost bases. Additionally, recent signs that global inflation has peaked could mean the pace of rate rises slows. While in 2021 earnings were given a boost as banks cancelled tens of billions of worst-case coronavirus-related loan provisions, the trend reversed this year. Banco Santander alone has added €7.5bn to its loan-loss reserves so far in 2022, an increase of a quarter from the same period a year earlier. In the UK, HSBC added $1.07bn to its impairment reserves in the third quarter and chief executive Noel Quinn told the Financial Times this month he had identified $1.7bn of extra cost cuts in order to remain on track to hit its target of expenses rising 2 per cent next year. “2023 carries higher risk of disappointment versus expectations, especially in a scenario of a worse than expected slowdown,” said Kian Abouhossein, head of European banks research at JPMorgan. A recession “could lead to a double-whammy of fewer rate hikes and asset-quality deterioration”. JPMorgan is forecasting €63bn of loan provisions in its base case, rising to €118bn in a “stress scenario”. Abouhossein also noted the “curve ball risk” of windfall taxes being imposed by cash-strapped governments, following Spain’s decision to raise €3bn from the interest-rate driven profits of its lenders. Dividend bans by regulators during the coronavirus pandemic also remain fresh in investor memories, with some concerned central banks will impose fresh restrictions if the economic outlook darkens. “Capital returns are key, the problem is that they are not decided by loan-loss models or executives, but the view of the supervisor,” said Jérôme Legras, head of research at investment company Axiom. The ECB “will keep a very conservative approach. From a supervisory view there is no downside in being too cautious.” The tide has turned But, years of disappointment have not killed all hope.  David Herro, deputy chair of the $99bn asset manager Harris Associates, has been a longtime owner of top-10 stakes in European banks including Lloyds, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas. “The European financial sector is one of the most attractive areas to invest given it is now fully or even overcapitalised, the positive impact of higher rates, and the ability to continue to grow lending volumes and fee income,” said Herro. “These should more than make up for the possibility of higher credit costs.” Fears about 1970s-style stagflation have also not yet come to pass. Unemployment remains low, there is little evidence of customer distress and much of the tens of billions in coronavirus-related bad debt reserves remain in reserve ready to absorb losses. The trading arms of investment banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas have seen revenue leap to historic levels as rate rises and geopolitics caused market volatility, which will continue through next year. “For the last 15 years banks have struggled against a number of headwinds related to strengthening their balance sheets and righting the wrongs of the past, but now the tide has turned,” said Rob James, a fund manager at Premier Miton. “While many sectors will find rising interest rates a struggle, banking, for once, is in the sweet spot.” *This article has been amended since initial publication to reflect the fact that Nordea is a Finnish bank","30.12.2022"
"FirstFT: Oil prices surge","Also in today’s newsletter, Russia confiscates passports of senior officials and Tesla smashes production record","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning  Oil prices are rising today, reigniting tensions between Saudi Arabia and the US and stoking concerns about a resurgence of global inflation. Riyadh led members of the Opec+ group of oil-producing countries yesterday in announcing an unexpected cut to production by more than 1mn barrels a day. The decision was announced on the eve of an Opec+ meeting today and caught energy markets by surprise. International oil benchmark Brent crude rose as much as 8.4 per cent to a high of $86.44 a barrel in early Asian trading, while US marker West Texas Intermediate climbed as much as 8 per cent to $81.69 a barrel.  Brent and WTI later pared their gains to be up 5.4 per cent at $84.17 and 5.4 per cent higher at $79.78 respectively by mid-morning European time. The announcement follows the decision in October by Opec+ to cut production by 2mn b/d, a move the US likened to siding with Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.  People familiar with Saudi Arabia’s thinking said Riyadh was irritated last week that the Biden administration publicly ruled out new crude purchases to replenish a strategic stockpile that had been drained last year as the White House battled rising inflation. US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm said it would take “years” to replenish the country’s strategic stockpiles. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the move by Opec+ would potentially push up prices in the global economy this year.  Economists at Goldman Sachs today raised their year-end forecast for Brent crude by $5 to $95 a barrel. The bank also boosted its oil price forecast for the end of 2024 to $100 a barrel.  Inflation had begun to ease in the US and Europe as energy prices have fallen following last year’s price rise after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. An aggressive series of interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank had also helped to lower demand and reduce inflationary pressures.

For the best part of two decades, Abramovich was the face of Russian investment in the UK. His capital was welcome and he was lauded as the benefactor who turned Chelsea into serial winners, culminating in the football club’s victory in the Club World Cup final on February 12 last year. Less than two weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine. Abramovich tried to keep hold of Chelsea by passing ownership to the club’s own charitable foundation. But the plan failed, and Abramovich had to sell. More than 250 enquiries later, US investors Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly won the bidding and paid £2.5bn for Chelsea. Although the net proceeds haven’t been confiscated per se, Abramovich can’t lay a finger on them because he remains subject to UK government sanctions. Abramovich had earmarked the cash for “all victims of the war in Ukraine”, and a series of international experts, including former Unicef UK chief Mike Penrose and Norwegian humanitarian Jan Egeland, are leading on the creation of a foundation to spearhead the humanitarian effort. So why isn’t the charity up and running? The trouble is there’s a deadlock over exactly how the cash can be used. The UK government wants the £2.3bn to be put to use within Ukraine’s borders. Penrose says that’s suboptimal because the foundation needs flexibility to help Ukrainian citizens who become refugees, or to support countries hurt by grain shortages as a result of the war.  The money can’t shift from the frozen bank account to the charity until the UK hands out a special licence. Abramovich, too, is required to sign off. As the UK balances the need to get the funds to war-stricken Ukraine with the risk of being seen to accommodate the wishes of an oligarch, the humanitarian crisis means this is a deadlock that is in urgent need of a solution.  Rome challenges China’s grip of Pirelli In France, yoghurt and bottled water have been deemed strategic assets. In Italy, the home of motor racing giant Ferrari, a tyre manufacturer’s relationship with China is attracting government scrutiny. On Friday, the office of Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni said it will restrict Beijing chemicals giant Sinochem’s shareholder powers relating to its 37 per cent stake in tyremaker Pirelli, citing national security risks. The move has received a lukewarm response from investors. Pirelli shares remained flat Monday, their first trading day after the decision was published. The government intervention has prompted some analysts to predict China will retaliate, potentially damaging Pirelli’s business in a country which accounts for 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its total sales.  “Near term, pressure on the shares should go down a bit as Italy did not officially ask Chinese to sell down their stake even though governance uncertainties remain (too) high,” said Oddo Bhf analysts in a note. Marco Tronchetti Provera has run Pirelli since 1992 © Bloomberg The decision concentrates power in the hands of Marco Tronchetti Provera, who has run the company since 1992. His private investment vehicle will have the right to appoint the chief executive indefinitely, despite only holding a 14 per cent stake. An Italian board member vetted by the government will also be appointed to ensure the order is complied with, the government order said. Sinochem will be barred from accessing certain company information. Sinochem’s reaction to the decision is still unclear. But the saga, which has publicly pitted the Italian tyre tycoon against China’s Communist Party, may define Sino-Italian business relations for years to come. The decision shows the influence Italy’s government wields over assets deemed of strategic national importance. Under its broad brush powers, Rome deemed Pirelli’s tyre technology, which includes chips that can access users’ personal information and geolocalisation data, to be a strategic asset. Pirelli was not considered strategically relevant at the time of the Chinese investment in 2015. But fraying relations between China and the West have led to European governments viewing Chinese investment with increasing scepticism. Getting caught in the geopolitical crossfire is not likely to help Pirelli’s business. Oddo Bhf analysts say this “still looks like a lose-lose situation” as there isn’t an “easy way towards a resolution of the current governance tensions”. Clock ticks for ManU’s billionaire owners Manchester United will start its next Premier League campaign against Wolverhampton Wanderers later this summer. But the biggest nail-biter is happening off pitch. By the end of last week, the club’s stock had gained more than 25 per cent on reports — later denied — that Qatari businessman Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani had edged ahead of billionaire UK industrialist Sir Jim Ratcliffe to buy the club. All eyes are now on Manchester’s owners, the billionaire Glazer family, to finally make a call. And while they’re typically ones to shy away from the press, the dragged-out process has fuelled speculation that the six siblings could be divided in their stance, the FT’s Samuel Agini reports. “There is clearly not cohesion in the Glazer camp,” on whether to pursue a full sale or find a minority investor, according to someone who has worked with the family for years. “But they don’t tell you what that is, so it is very difficult for anyone to help.” Another person involved in the process said the siblings are on the same page and willing sellers at the right price, however. It has been seven months since the family hired the Raine Group to review options for the 145-year-old club, the same merchant bank that brokered the £2.5bn sale of Chelsea FC last year. But this is a very different process than Chelsea, in which sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was forced to make a gametime decision. Manchester United fans protest against the Glazers ownership of the club © AFP via Getty Images Led by executive co-chairs Joel and Avram, the six Glazer siblings have enjoyed a dual-class share structure following an initial public offering in New York in 2012 that has allowed the family to keep tight control of the club. The family’s B shares wield 10 times the voting rights of A shares, and they automatically convert into A shares when they are sold, meaning they can sell stock without ever jeopardising their control. But supporters and suitors are fed up alike. Sheikh Jassim, whose father is one of the richest men in the tiny Gulf state, threatened to walk away earlier this month. And the Glazer clan hasn’t been on fans’ good sides since backing the European Super League in an ill-fated quest for profits. “Our silence wrongly created the impression that we don’t care, that we aren’t football fans, that we only care about our commercial interests and money,” Joel Glazer told a fans forum after the ESL collapsed in 2021. The clock is running out for the family to prove their doubters wrong. Job moves KKR has changed the leadership of its Asia-Pacific private equity team.

"‘Firefighter and policeman’: Fed faces rate rise dilemma amid banks turmoil","US central bank’s next move complicated by uncertainty over efforts to shore up sector","The US Federal Reserve must make one of the most consequential decisions of its rate-raising campaign this week as it considers whether to implement another increase without knowing if efforts to shore up the banking sector will work in the long term. Central bank officials will gather on Tuesday for their latest two-day meeting, at which they must decide whether to press ahead with another quarter-point rate rise or forgo an increase. The dilemma comes as global authorities have acted swiftly to support the financial system in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, with the Fed rolling out a new facility to aid lenders and the Swiss government brokering a hasty takeover of a faltering Credit Suisse by UBS.  However, it remains unclear whether these actions will be enough to stem the fallout from the crisis. The share prices of most regional US banks are languishing well below the levels seen before the implosion of SVB, while First Republic Bank’s stock is still plummeting following a second downgrade of its credit rating on Sunday. As a result, the Fed is to some extent flying blind as it decides whether to pause its aggressive campaign to curb persistent inflation in an effort to help stabilise the financial system. “It’s a tremendously challenging time,” said Ellen Meade, who served as a senior adviser to the central bank’s board of governors until 2021. “In this case, [Fed chair Jay] Powell has to be both a firefighter and a policeman.” Further complicating the high-stakes decision, due on Wednesday, is that it will be accompanied by fresh projections not just for the trajectory of interest rates, but also for growth, inflation and unemployment, at a time when the economic situation is changing rapidly. “This whole thing is a disinflationary event . . . but it’s very difficult to know at this point how disinflationary it is,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, referring to the turmoil in banking. Fuelling the uncertainty is the fact that regional banks are expected to sharply curtail their lending in response to the recent ructions. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimates that banks holding roughly 40 per cent of all assets across the sector could retrench, which would lead to a sharp recession this year.  “What we do know is that the combination of both the lagged effects of monetary policy slowing things down and now magnifying that with this downside risk is just making things more complicated,” he said.  Slok estimates the combination of tighter financial conditions and lending standards following the recent bank failures has in effect raised the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to each other — by 1.5 percentage points from its current target range of between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent. As a result, he now expects the Fed to forgo a rate rise on Wednesday. Economists at Goldman Sachs, who also project a pause this week, forecast the equivalent of roughly a quarter-point to a half-point increase in the fed funds rate following recent events. Other economists argue it is still too early to make a precise estimate. Pausing the rate-rising campaign altogether would mark an abrupt U-turn for the central bank, which had as recently as this month raised the prospect of accelerating the pace of rate rises with a half-point increase after last month shifting down to a more typical quarter-point cadence. In congressional testimonies before the release of February’s jobs and inflation figures, Powell said the decision would hinge in part on those closely watched pieces of data, neither of which showed much sign of a cooling economy. He also said the Fed would ultimately need to lift its benchmark rate higher than the 5.1 per cent projected by officials as recently as December. Most economists have since revised down their expectations for the so-called dot plot, which aggregates individual forecasts for the fed funds rate through to 2025.  Before the implosion of SVB, many thought the median estimate for the so-called terminal rate would rise by half a percentage point to between 5.5 per cent and 5.75 per cent. Now, some forecast that to remain unchanged while others expect only a quarter-point increase. Traders in fed funds futures markets are even more hesitant, suggesting the Fed will only raise rates another quarter of a percentage point before reversing course and implementing cuts. “The Fed has got some more to do,” said Vincent Reinhart, who worked at the US central bank for more than two decades and is now at Dreyfus and Mellon, though he said officials were “less sure where they’re headed”. Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and commentary here Economists polled in the latest Financial Times survey, conducted in partnership with the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, said recent events had led them to scale back their expectations for the fed funds rate at the end of the year by a quarter of a percentage point. However most still see the Fed raising the rate at least to 5.5 per cent — and keeping it there until 2024. Reinhart warned that if the Fed were to pause its rate rises in an attempt to shore up financial stability, especially as further tightening is warranted by the economic data, it would face increased criticism for having failed to manage the banking sector sufficiently to prevent such a problem in the first place. Moreover, Meade cautioned that such a move could call into question Powell’s commitment to fighting inflation, adding she supported a quarter-point rise. “It preserves the notion of credibility that he’s gone to great lengths to restore over the past year,” she said. “I wouldn’t think he would want to let that go at this point.”","21.03.2023"
"The fight over fossil fuel phaseout vs disclosure ","Also in today’s newsletter, the business of impact investing grows up ","This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.Visit our Moral Money hub for all the latest ESG news, opinion and analysis from around the FT  France’s TotalEnergies this week made “a clean exit” from Canadian oil sands with a $4bn sale of its assets there to Suncor, Canada’s second-largest oil company. It marks the latest divestment by European energy companies from Canada’s oil, which is often associated with higher levels of pollution than conventional production. BP also quit Canada’s oil sands industry last year. US companies have been far less willing to part ways with oil assets for environmental reasons. This echoes the trend among US and European banks. European lenders, notably HSBC, are shifting away from fossil fuel projects. US banks have not, and continue to face fire from environmentalists for energy dealmaking at annual meetings. There’s more on this theme below in my report about this week’s climate shareholder proposals at four of the biggest US banks.  And I also have news from the impact investing world, where it is getting harder to be best-in-class. — Patrick Temple-West As pressure mounts to meet global net zero goals, carbon markets are in the spotlight. Approaches vary from cap-and-trade compliance schemes to voluntary carbon markets and internal carbon pricing. Meanwhile, some argue that to reduce emissions at sufficient scale and speed, carbon taxes are essential. The next FT Moral Money Forum report will explore the options and review the opportunities. And we want to hear from you. Do you favour carbon taxes? Can voluntary markets overcome quality concerns? Will compliance markets do more to push business to decarbonise? Share your thoughts here. Environmentalists face impasse on fossil fuel phase-out vs disclosure  Shareholders at Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs this week voted on petitions asking the banks to phase out financing of new fossil fuel projects. These proposals didn’t fare well last year — and support for them this year was even lower. Fewer than 10 per cent of shareholders supported these resolutions, the banks said. Last year 11-12 per cent of shareholders endorsed the phaseout demands. “Investors have once again failed to align their voting with their stated positions on climate-related financial risk,” said Jessye Waxman, a senior campaigner at the Sierra Club. Investors “must move beyond calls for disclosure only” on climate issues at banks’ annual meetings, she added. But shareholder proposals asking banks to disclose more about their climate policies actually fared better with investors. A first-time shareholder proposal at Goldman Sachs asked the bank to provide a realistic climate transition plan for 2030, and it won support from 30 per cent of the firms’ shareholders. The vote followed with a similar proposal at Bank of America that won 28.5 per cent support. (See our colleagues’ story on these votes here).  “Although Goldman has committed to aligning key sectors of its financing portfolio with net zero targets, its plan for achieving those goals is unclear,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, the advocacy group that filed the petitions. “This strong vote is a call to action,” she said. “Goldman Sachs has demonstrated leadership in setting 2030 targets aligned with global climate goals. Now comes the hard work of making its plan actionable,” she said. Environmental activists seem to be at an impasse. On the one hand, they could demand banks phase out fossil fuel projects and garner about 10 per cent support — not quite enough to rattle companies into changing behaviour. Or activists could demand disclosures and transition plans, which appear to be favoured by investors. The first approach conceivably reaps climate action more quickly — but only if more shareholders throw their weight behind it.  Amid the political attacks on ESG in the US, “asset managers — more than ever — do not wish to be perceived to be telling company management how to do their jobs,” Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar’s director of investment stewardship research, told me. “They want disclosure around climate strategy, but don’t want to set that strategy.” The situation is quite different on the other side of the Atlantic, where, as mentioned above, institutions have shown more action on decarbonisation drives. But it’s a bit like comparing apples and oranges. “It’s hard to conclude that shareholder action on climate is disadvantaging US banks compared with their international peers,” he said. “That pressure is manifesting in a different way on the other side of the Atlantic.”  Next month, the last two of the six major US banks will hold their annual meetings — JPMorgan on May 16 and Morgan Stanley on May 19 — and both face a similar suite of climate proposals as their peers. (Patrick Temple-West) The unsteady evolution of impact investing Nuveen Investments is one of six firms on BlueMark’s impact leaderboard  © Bloomberg In the past few years, impact investing has evolved from a strategy for environmentalists into a growth opportunity for the world’s biggest banks. Speaking at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, then-UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers said “client interest in impact investing is rising significantly.” But a chronic problem with impact reports is that they have been largely anecdotal. Impact reports from large financial firms tend to highlight a few investments in a school or clean energy project, but precise metrics are left out. For all the enthusiasm for impact investing, the data is sparse and only a handful of firms have been identified as leaders in the space. Almost 200 firms have signed up for the impact investing principles set up by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation in 2019. These fund managers — which include Apollo, BlackRock and KKR — agreed to have their impact management practices* verified by independent assessors and update information annually.  According to BlueMark, a third-party verification firm, only six out of 60 firms sit atop its impact leaderboard: Bain Capital, British International Investment, Finance in Motion, Leapfrog, Nuveen and Trill.  To earn their spots on the leaderboard, these firms must identify* how much their investments are helping society. How significant is the intended impact? On the other hand, the firms must avoid ESG risks. Ultimately, firms must have impact objectives that are consistent and can actually be achieved. You can read the BlueMark 2022 report for British International Investment here. “Our goal with publishing the leaderboard was to create a race to the top,” Christina Leijonhufvud, BlueMark’s chief executive, told me. Next month, BlueMark will be updating its leaderboard as four more names made the cut, she said. “We wanted to make sure this is not a check-the-box exercise. It will get harder to make it into that top quartile” of impact firms, she said.  As impact investing grows up, some big name investors are also eyeing opportunities within the businesses that do the ratings. Last week, BlueMark announced it had raised $10mn from S&P Global, Temasek and other investors. “We see significant growth opportunities for impact investing in Asia and around the world,” said Dawn Chan, a managing director at Temasek, the Singaporean state-owned investment fund.

"Cracks in Libor’s reckoning: Were traders criminals or scapegoats?","After a series of US court rulings, Tom Hayes is trying to appeal against his UK conviction for rate rigging","A decade on from the Libor scandal, US courts have rejected a series of criminal charges against traders accused of fiddling the rate once used to benchmark hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial contracts. Between January and October, a New York court has thrown out criminal charges against Tom Hayes, a UK trader who worked at UBS and Citi trader, and Roger Darin, another former UBS trader. It also overturned the convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders, Matthew Connolly and Gavin Black. The rulings mean that all US trial convictions relating to Libor “rigging” have now been reversed.   For the traders, the rulings vindicate long-held feelings that they were made scapegoats for banks in need of sacrifices after the 2008 financial crisis. For others, some traders still deserve condemnation for the scandal, regardless of whether it amounted to criminality. Even as the New York appeals court rejected the government’s arguments that Connolly and Black’s conduct had been criminal, it said that their behaviour “may have violated any reasonable notion of fairness”. “At the end of the day, Libor rigging involved major corporate misconduct . . . It was absolutely right that prosecutors sought to hold people accountable for it,” said Sue Hawley, executive director at anti-corruption group Spotlight on Corruption, though she questioned whether the right people ended up in the dock.  Libor — the London Interbank Offered Rate — was meant to approximate the average rate at which banks could borrow short term cash from one another and at its peak underpinned some $350tn of financial instruments including credit card fees and corporate loans.  A scandal over how Libor was set erupted after 2012, resulting in charges for traders conspiring to rig the rate in their favour and some $9bn in fines for banks worldwide.  Connolly says he was clueless about his alleged involvement until 2013, when the FBI showed up at the New Jersey native’s home. The 57-year-old, who did not trade Libor directly himself, had left Deutsche in 2008, and was originally convicted on the back of four emails containing requests relating to Libor trades, one of which he was just copied into.  “The people held accountable were low hanging fruit — easy to get, easy to pin a crime on so the prosecutors could say ‘hey look we are doing something’,” Connolly, who is suing Deutsche bank for $150mn, told the Financial Times.  The problem with Libor — that it often relied on estimates of borrowing rates rather than actual transactions — had long been an open secret in corners of financial markets but only broke into the public consciousness in the wake of the financial crisis.   “There was a tremendous amount of criticism [before the Libor probes] that nobody went to jail for the 2008 financial crisis, and a feeling that fraud among major financial institutions was running rampant and something should be done,” says Jonathan Macey, a Yale law professor.  In the US, between 2016 and 2017, Connolly, Black and Hayes were all indicted for pressuring Libor submitters to enter rates favourable to their banks’ trading positions. However, a Manhattan appeals court has now ruled that the government failed to show in Connolly and Black’s cases that any of the trader-influenced submissions were “false, fraudulent, or misleading”. Prosecutors withdrew Hayes and Darin’s charges in response. There was a range of possible rates that banks could submit, not one true number, said the court. And traders’ motivations — for example their commercial interests — did not undermine the submissions as long as the bank could have borrowed at that price.   “The government couldn’t prove [in these cases] that the Libor rates submitted were fraudulent,” said Macey. The UK is now the only country in the world to have criminalised the kind of Libor rate rigging the traders were alleged to have engaged in, which no longer meets the threshold for fraud in America and was not considered unlawful elsewhere. In London, Hayes — the first person in the world to be found guilty by a jury over the Libor scandal in 2015 — is trying to use the US rulings to force a last-ditch appeal of his case.  He is hoping to persuade the Criminal Cases Review Commission, a panel that investigates miscarriages of justice, that the law was wrongly applied in his UK case, as in the US, and has filed new submissions this week. The CCRC has already been weighing his case for almost six years. If successful, Hayes could undermine the whole premise of UK Libor convictions. “A lot of us have deep misgivings about these convictions,” says Sara George, a defence lawyer at Sidley Austin who has represented a number of ex-traders in Libor probes, and is advising Hayes on an appeal to the UK financial regulator. “The witch hunt, the fact it was the junior traders were punished. The mood music has changed . . . ” Born in Shepherds Bush, Hayes joined UBS as an intern and, after stints at other lenders, shot up the ranks at the Swiss bank to become a star derivatives trader in Tokyo, where he claims to have made the bank around $300mn in profits between 2006 and 2009. Tom Hayes, a former trader at UBS, leaves after appearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London, 2013 © Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg Hayes, who has Asperger’s syndrome, was nicknamed “Rain Man” and “Tommy Chocolate” by colleagues, the latter because he drank hot chocolate instead of beer when out socialising with brokers. He was handed one of the longest-ever sentences for a white collar crime — 14 years in prison, reduced to 11 on appeal — and spent several years in a high security prison where he shared a cell with a convicted murderer.  Hayes says he has “lost a quarter of my life” fighting his conviction, and maintains he is innocent. UK prosecutors had originally decided against pursuing criminal prosecutions for Libor “rigging” but following intensifying calls from members of parliament, David Green, Serious Fraud Office director at the time, launched an investigation in 2012. The probe became known for the colourful messages shared by traders. “Dude. I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of Bollinger”, read one. “We have another big fixing tom[orrow] and with the market move I was hoping we could set [certain] Libors as high as possible”, read another. The SFO ultimately secured five convictions, including a guilty plea from Barclays’ main Libor submitter Peter Johnson, while eight people were acquitted, including Hayes’s alleged co-conspirators. The agency also secured four convictions against ex-bankers accused of conspiring to rig Libor’s European equivalent, Euribor. But it was forced to abandon four others after French and German courts ruled the conduct was not unlawful and refused to extradite them. At trial Hayes argued that his conduct was not dishonest but standard practice among bankers, and encouraged by his bosses. Hayes, who was convicted of conspiracy to defraud, argued he had been made a scapegoat for his managers and the banks themselves.  There have also been suggestions that senior bankers were under pressure from the Bank of England to “lowball” their Libor submissions, to appear healthier than they really were during a time of intense market stress. The BoE has always denied the accusation and the SFO opened an investigation into “lowballing” but ultimately brought no charges. Hayes initially admitted dishonesty to UK prosecutors in many hours of interviews, but later took back the confession, arguing he had been trying to avoid extradition to the US. Hayes says he had a “nervous breakdown” when he was told he could face a 30-year prison sentence in America, something he avoided due to time-served in the UK.  But his admissions formed a large volume of evidence at trial.   In a series of hearings running up to Hayes’s 2015 trial, Mr Justice Jeremy Cooke said it was clear that Libor rules prevented any consideration of commercial interests when submitting Libor rates. But Hayes has disputed that definition in evidence to the CCRC. “Independence of the rate never happened, it’s a fallacy,” said Hayes. In an unusual move, the CCRC has asked Hayes to make submissions about the US court decisions. But the issue for Hayes is that the two legal systems are entirely separate, and he faces an uphill battle to persuade the CCRC to send his case back to an English court. The panel provisionally refused to do so last year and must believe Hayes’s new evidence could realistically lead to the appeals court overturning his conviction, if it is to send his case back there. The Court of Appeal has already sided with the court’s original judgment of how Libor rules worked, and has also dismissed a series of appeals from other ex-traders. “He was undoubtedly a fall guy and it’s ridiculously unfair that he was the one that got pinned for this,” said one defence lawyer who is not working on the case. “The prison sentence was really harsh . . . But the bar to getting [cases overturned] is really high.”  Others are less forgiving, even if they say the real blame lies higher up the food chain. “The real shame is that the banks themselves and those at the helm who either allowed or turned a blind eye to this behaviour couldn’t be held to account properly in the UK,” said Hawley.

"Robey Warshaw partners share £30mn in George Osborne’s first year","The firm’s best-paid partner received £17.2mn of the gains","Former UK chancellor George Osborne is set to share in £30mn in profits from his first year as a partner at boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw. The firm, which has advised on some of the biggest deals in the UK over the past decade, handed £17.2mn of the gains to its best-paid partner, assumed to be former Morgan Stanley banker Simon Robey, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The remaining profits are divided up between the other three partners. Despite a broad slowdown in transactions, the firm’s revenues of £39.8mn were nearly identical to last year’s turnover, and profits in the year to March were almost flat compared to the £30.1mn made in 2021.Rising interest rates and inflation, combined with volatile markets have contributed to a dramatic plunge in mergers and acquisitions this year after a boom in 2021.   Robey Warshaw’s performance was held up by roles such as advising RSA Insurance Group during its sale to a pair of overseas rivals. The firm also advised National Grid on the sale of its gas transmission and metering business. Since March Robey Warshaw has helped US financier Todd Boehly’s bidding group on its acquisition of Chelsea Football Club and worked with HSBC on its defence against calls from its largest shareholder to split up the bank.  It also advised Vodafone on the sale of part of its €14.8bn mobile phone masts business. The firm launched in 2013 when Robey, the former co-head of global M&A at Morgan Stanley, joined Simon Warshaw, the former head of investment banking at UBS, to start their own business. Its third founder is former Morgan Stanley banker Philip Apostolides.With fewer than 15 employees, the firm has been among the most successful deal advisory businesses since its formation, challenging larger rivals while generating hefty profits. Robey personally has earned more than £150mn since starting the business, according to a Financial Times analysis.The group, which is structured as a limited liability partnership, is not liable for tax on its profits, with each partner responsible for tax on their own share. Its 13 employees were paid a combined total of £6.7mn.   Osborne, who joined the firm in 2021, won one of his first mandates last September when he secured it a role advising Rusal, a subsidiary of London-listed EN+ that was founded by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, although nothing came of the mandate. Large acquisitions, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev’s £79bn takeover of SABMiller in 2016 and US cable group Comcast’s £30.6bn acquisition of UK broadcaster Sky in 2018, helped Robey Warshaw make its name.

"ECB set to raise rates despite fall in eurozone inflation","Central bank expected to lift deposit rate by half a percentage point on Thursday as pressures persist","Eurozone rate-setters are set to raise borrowing costs by another half percentage point on Thursday, after figures published on Wednesday showed underlying inflationary pressures in the region remain uncomfortably high.  The regional rate for core inflation – which excludes changes in food and energy prices, and is considered the best measure of the stickiness of price pressures — remained unchanged at an all-time high of 5.2 per cent in the year to January.  The figure, coupled with the resilience of eurozone output during the final quarter of 2022, all but confirms the European Central Bank will raise its deposit rate by another half a percentage point to 2.5 per cent at around lunchtime on Thursday.   The bank raised rates by 2.5 percentage points over the second half of 2022 in response to inflation, which hit a record high of 10.6 per cent in October. The headline rate fell from 9.2 per cent in the year to December to 8.5 per cent last month – still more than four times the ECB’s 2 per cent goal.  Anna Titareva, economist at Swiss lender UBS, said the ECB would want to see improvement in the “broader inflation environment” before changing course on its monetary policy.  “The jump in core inflation in some key countries [such as Spain] will be enough for the central bank to confirm its current hawkish stance,” said Bert Colijn, economist at ING Bank.  Ken Wattret, head of European analysis at S&P Global Market Intelligence, a data firm, said rate-setters remained “on track” to raise rates by half a point in February and by a further half-point at their next meeting in March.   The headline figure was lower than the 9 per cent forecast by economists polled by Reuters. It came after data published on Tuesday showed eurozone GDP unexpectedly expanded between the third and fourth quarter of last year. It now looks set to avoid a winter recession despite the surge in energy prices and rising borrowing costs. Separate data, also published by Eurostat on Wednesday, showed that the region’s labour market remained resilient. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.6 per cent in December, the lowest since records began in 1995.   Fabio Balboni, economist at lender HSBC, said the better data would mean the ECB may be “more determined” to press on with rate rises, with stronger-than-expected growth likely to boost core inflation.  Headline inflation is slowing in most advanced countries, including the US and the UK, reflecting the easing of global energy costs. However, measures of underlying inflation are a concern for policymakers. The US Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates by 25 basis points later on Wednesday, while the Bank of England is likely to increase its benchmark rate by 50bp on Thursday.  The decline in the headline rate was driven by falls in energy inflation, which slowed to 17.2 per cent in January from 25.5 per cent in the previous month. It is now less than half of the peak of 41.5 per cent in October.  However, food inflation hit a fresh record high of 14 per cent in January, up from 13.8 per cent the previous month.  Inflation in the cost of goods also accelerated to a fresh record high of 6.9 per cent. That rate is declining in the US and UK thanks to the easing of global supply chain disruptions and the fall in shipping costs.  Services inflation, a bellwether of domestic price pressures, marginally declined to 4.2 per cent in January from 4.4 per cent in the previous month.  January’s inflation rates varied from 21.6 per cent for Latvia to 5.8 per cent for Spain. Germany has not yet published its figures for January. Eurostat said eurozone inflation had been calculated using its own estimates for the region’s largest economy.  Its estimate did not, however, take into account the removal of government subsidies, which had lowered the cost of households’ fuel bills in earlier months.   Jack Allen-Reynolds, economist at Capital Economics, said the lack of accurate information available on German inflation meant the sharp fall in the eurozone headline rate “should be taken with a big pinch of salt”.","01.02.2023"
"Credit Suisse: customers are bailing out as shareholders are buying in","A stronger balance sheet is part of the bank’s proposed rejig but weakness in wealth management threatens that aspiration","Credit Suisse shareholders know by now that no news is the best news. An obligatory update from the stricken Swiss bank rammed the point home. Credit Suisse is forecast to make a SFr1.5bn ($1.6bn) pre-tax loss in the final quarter of the year. Darkening the mood further, the lender recorded net outflows in wealth management equal to a tenth of assets in six weeks. None of this inspires confidence in the over-complex restructuring plan investors had gathered to sign off on. Shares fell up to 5 per cent to trade at their lowest level on record since 1975. In theory, the turnround begins on Thursday when terms for the rights issue portion of a SFr4bn ($4.2bn) capital raise are released. A stronger balance sheet is one part of the proposed rejig. Weakness in wealth management, part of the bank’s “new core”, threatens that aspiration.  Net outflows were already afflicting every region and every business line during the third quarter. The group cannot credibly blame the downturn. Peers are still attracting new funds. UBS took in $17bn of net new wealth management money in its third quarter. Julius Baer said on Monday it had garnered $4.3bn between June and October.  Following the capital raise, Credit Suisse is targeting a common equity tier one ratio of 14 per cent. It believes that is sufficient to shrink its investment banking assets by 40 per cent and turn itself into a lower risk business.  Restructuring costs will eat into capital. But asset sales will provide some support. Capital generation from core businesses is a key pillar to achieving a CET1 ratio of 13.5 per cent by 2025.  Following this year’s steep losses, net income might break even in 2023. Combined net profits in 2024 and 2025 are then expected to be SFr4bn, according to Visible Alpha. Wealth management is expected to generate half of that total at an operating level.  The exodus of wealthy clients is already putting that assumption to the test.  The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

"Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit notches record revenue","Shares climb more than 7% as investors look past drop in profits in investment banking unit","Record wealth management revenues helped Morgan Stanley partly offset a sharp fall at its investment bank, allowing it to beat earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. Overall, Morgan Stanley reported a 40 per cent year-on-year drop in net income to $2.2bn, but the results on Tuesday for earnings of $1.26 a share exceeded analysts’ estimates of $1.19. The numbers also highlighted the impact of chief executive James Gorman’s efforts to diversify into wealth and asset management. So far, amid difficult markets, he has only partially succeeded in providing a counterbalance to highly cyclical investment banking earnings.  But investors have cheered the approach, helping to open up a stock market valuation gap with longtime rival Goldman Sachs, which also reported earnings on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley shares were up more than 7 per cent in morning trading. The company’s results included $133mn to fund about 1,800 job cuts, about 2 to 3 per cent of the company’s workforce, that the bank made late last year. Chief financial officer Sharon Yeshaya said that no further lay-offs were expected unless the economy worsened. “We’re comfortable with our position,” she added. Investment banking had another challenging quarter, with Morgan Stanley’s revenues falling 49 per cent year on year to $1.25bn, in line with analysts’ estimates of $1.2bn. Rivals JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup on Friday reported that investment banking revenues in the latest quarter more than halved from a year ago. The drop underscored the difference from 2021, when Morgan Stanley and rivals raked in revenue from advising on mergers and acquisitions and new stock market listings. Such activity slowed dramatically in 2022.  Revenues in wealth management, which includes online trading platform ETrade, were up 6 per cent to more than $6.6bn. But investment management, including Eaton Vance following Morgan Stanley’s acquisition of the money manager in 2021, was hit by falling markets that cut assets under management. Revenues dropped 17 per cent to $1.5bn but topped analyst estimates of $1.3bn.  “As we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognising we have a line of sight with the durability of our wealth and investment management businesses,” Gorman said on a call with analysts. “I feel good about where the whole package is.” Analysts at UBS called the “core trends encouraging” and opined that “resilient wealth management” meant Morgan Stanley was “clearing the low bar”.  Trading results were substantially weaker than analysts expected, with net revenue of $3.6bn. Fixed-income trading had its best year in a decade but equity numbers were dragged down by an unflattering comparison with 2021, when the bank booked mark to market gains. By comparison, JPMorgan trading revenues were up 7 per cent and Citi’s were also up, by 18 per cent.  Gorman and Yeshaya highlighted the bank’s 15.3 per cent common equity tier one capital ratio, which they said gave the bank the flexibility to continue share buybacks, increase its dividend and take advantage of opportunities once the economy improves. “When markets rebound, we will capitalise on growth,” Gorman said on a call with analysts. “It’s a great position to be in.” The chief executive also said the improving margins in wealth management, which hit 29.2 per cent in the fourth quarter excluding integration expenses, were approaching the company’s goal of 30 per cent. That helped the unit generate $6.6bn in pre-tax profits in 2022. Longer-term, Gorman said the company was seeking to increase client assets, which stand at $5.5tn at present, by $1tn every three years. Gorman said he was “pretty confident” about the economic outlook and expected the US Federal Reserve to stop raising rates some time later this year. “When the Fed pauses, underwriting activity will pick up.” ","17.01.2023"
"Fed officials back slower pace of rate rises after inflation data ","Investors expect shift down after better-than-expected consumer price figures","A growing cohort of Federal Reserve officials have thrown their support behind slowing the pace of future interest rate rises, as investors increased bets on such a move following the release of slower-than-expected inflation data on Thursday.Patrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, was the latest official to back the US central bank breaking its months-long streak of supersized increases, joining his counterparts at the Boston, Chicago and Richmond branches. “In the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow the pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance,” Harker said on Thursday. “But I want to be clear: a rate hike of 50 basis points would still be significant.” Lorie Logan, president of the Dallas Fed, also endorsed a shift down from 0.75 percentage point rises, which the Fed has implemented at every meeting since June, but emphasised the central bank’s commitment to stamping out inflation.  “While I believe it may soon be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases so we can better assess how financial and economic conditions are evolving, I also believe a slower pace should not be taken to represent easier policy,” she said at a Fed event on Thursday. According to CME Group, traders place the odds that the Fed will opt for a smaller move next month at 85 per cent, up from roughly 50 per cent on Wednesday. The shift in expectations — which was accompanied by a sharp rally in the S&P 500 — was propelled by fresh evidence that inflationary pressures are beginning to level off in some sectors. October’s consumer price index showed prices rising by 0.4 per cent for the month, in line with September’s increase, which translates to the smallest annual rise since January.  “Core” inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food and energy, slowed even more substantially, rising just 0.3 per cent compared to the 0.6 per cent increase recorded in the previous period. While economists cautioned against reading too much into a single inflation report, they acknowledged that the figures come as welcome news for the Fed, which has begun to build the case for slowing its rate rises. “It’s definitely time to slow the pace of rate hikes,” said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS and a former Fed staffer. “If we see slowing inflation at this point, with those lags in monetary policy, you’re likely to see inflation slow down even more.”  At the Fed’s November policy meeting last week, chair Jay Powell signalled his support for smaller rate rises, which he said could come as early as December, given the time it takes for changes to monetary policy to have an effect on economic activity and how significantly rates have risen this year. As a result, the end point of the tightening cycle would be higher than originally anticipated, Powell said, and the Fed would keep rates at a level that constrains the economy for longer. Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said October’s slowdown in consumer price growth was “good news” but “one month does not victory make”, suggesting further tightening to come. Also on Thursday, Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, welcomed the initial easing of inflationary pressures but cautioned that there may still be “upside risks” to the forecast. “Despite the moves we have made so far, given that inflation has consistently proven to be more persistent than expected and there are significant costs of continued high inflation, I currently view the larger risks as coming from tightening too little,” she said at an event hosted by Princeton University. On Thursday, investors revised their expectations marginally lower for the so-called terminal rate and now expect the federal funds rate to peak at 4.8 per cent, having previously predicted that it would surpass 5 per cent.  Yields on US government bonds also plummeted, with the policy-sensitive two-year note trading at 4.3 per cent, down from 4.6 per cent the previous day. Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, called the latest inflation data “the best piece of news in a while”. However, she reiterated her belief that the benchmark policy rate would eventually reach 5.1 per cent, arguing that the Fed needs to see a “long string” of weaker monthly core readings “before they are comfortable pausing”. One concern is that wage increases stemming from the tight labour market may continue to push up consumer price growth in the services sector, suggesting price pressures will be difficult to fully eliminate. “There’s still a significant chance that we may see some very strong inflation on the services side in the coming months,” said Detmeister at UBS.","10.11.2022"
"Morgan Stanley’s top international executive to step down","Franck Petitgas retires after 30-year career at Wall Street bank","Morgan Stanley’s top international executive, Franck Petitgas, is retiring from the Wall Street bank after a 30-year career in capital markets and investment banking. Petitgas — born in France and 61 years old — announced his decision internally on Monday, according to a memo from chief executive James Gorman seen by the Financial Times. However, he will remain a senior adviser to the bank and continue to represent it at events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. The memo, also sent by co-president Ted Pick, described Petitgas as “a world class professional” and a “trusted adviser to both of us as we navigate the complexities of a global business and client base”.  He joined Morgan Stanley in 1993 in New York and worked his way up to run the capital markets division, and ultimately oversaw all the bank’s businesses outside the US from London. Petitgas was instrumental in building Morgan Stanley’s lucrative relationship with the world’s largest oil exporter, Saudi Aramco, which raised $25.6bn in the world’s biggest initial public offering in 2019, as well as listings for Swedish private equity firm EQT and France’s Antin Infrastructure Partners. Other influential clients included Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi and his Altice investment vehicle, which is the largest shareholder in UK telecoms company BT. Once considered among a group of potential candidates to succeed Gorman as chief executive, several of Morgan Stanley’s top executives have left in recent years, including Colm Kelleher who went on to become chair of UBS. This year Gorman said he had no plans to step down soon. Whilst retiring from his executive role, Petitgas hoped to work as a government adviser or take up a non-executive or board role, said a person familiar with his thinking. Petitgas also had a profile outside of finance. He built a large art collection and is the owner of the historic Manor of Bosham, which includes hundreds of the moorings in the UK’s Chichester Harbour.  Buying the manor entitled him to the title of lord, which he referenced in his Twitter handle @boshammanor. Petitgas is also chair of the Tate Foundation, a charitable trust, and has received the Légion d’honneur, France’s highest civil and military award.","21.11.2022"
"When do banking failures matter for the economy?","The past does not provide us with all the answers, but it offers some guidance","This article is an on-site version of Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Thursday When I began studying economics around the turn of the millennium, hubris engulfed the profession.  One of the slides displayed during our first macroeconomics lecture was a chart of global GDP since the middle of the 19th century. It showed the global economy expanding exponentially over the entire period — besides one noticeable blip in the early 1930s.  That blip, sparked by the Wall Street crash of 1929, was, according to the lecturer, to all intents and purposes, irrelevant. “Don’t worry,” we were told, “we have solved that, it won’t happen again.”   Policymakers are no longer quite so cocky.  The global financial crisis in 2008 put paid to notions that all the questions on how to keep economies purring along nicely had been answered. It also opened up the eyes of many to the now blindingly obvious notion that the health of banks matters for the rest of us.  What caught out almost everyone before the collapse of Lehman Brothers was a view that the financial system was little more than a conduit for economic activity, an efficient allocator of capital devoid of its own inner life.  But do we now risk reading too much into finance’s capacity to create havoc?  The failure of Silicon Valley Bank has triggered concerns of a broader financial panic that could, in turn, spark a brutal credit crunch that would throw economies into recession. Those concerns were the reason the US authorities gave for bailing out all of the Californian lender’s depositors.  Yet, its business model — and the risks it took — are somewhat unique.  And there are many instances, such as the bursting of the dotcom bubble, when panic in financial markets has not had too devastating an impact on growth.  So how do we tell when banking failures will, and won’t matter, for the economy?  Often only with hindsight, is the honest answer.  Few would have suspected that, weeks after the collapse of SVB — a bank that few of us had heard of until it crashed — analysts would be blaming it for Saudi Arabia’s decision to cut its oil quota.  As is often the case, the past doesn’t provide us with all the answers, but it offers some guidance.  For the failure of a bank to affect the broader economy, two things have needed to happen. The first is that the failure must lead to a broader financial panic. The second is that the panic needs to trigger a broader credit crunch.   Banking is an unusual industry in that the failure of a rival is not necessarily a matter of cheer for those left standing.  UBS was a reluctant player in the rescue-takeover of Credit Suisse. If it had walked away, however, the consequences would have been likely even worse for it and, one suspects, for the rest of Europe’s banks.  So one of the first signals of concern is the degree to which one bank’s troubles creates negative externalities for its peers.  This can often be a question of perception. Can the failed bank be seen as unique in some respect? Can regulators convince the public others are well-capitalised and well-supervised? Is the broader economic mood confident or gloomy?  One metric to watch is deposit outflows (which is why a lot of people have been keeping a close eye on the US Federal Reserve’s H8 release of late).  In the past, however, the impact could take a while to feed through, even in bouts of turmoil as severe as the Great Depression. Here’s an out-take from a 2000 paper by economic historian Geoffrey Wood: “Bank deposits rose from January to March 1931, and in 1931 there were some signs that the downturn in activity was approaching an end. Industrial production rose from January to April, and the rate of decline of factory employment slowed sharply. But a second banking crisis broke in March. The public converted deposits to currency, and banks sold assets to increase their liquidity. This action put downward pressure on the money stock, which was only partly offset by inflows from abroad. The Federal Reserve did not act to offset the squeeze.” In the digital age, a smaller gap between the initial event and the run sounds feasible. But even in the era of 24/7 mobile banking, overall levels of deposits could prove surprisingly sticky.  Recession-inducing panics can also occur without a run. In 2008, for instance, they hardly budged.  A more timely indicator may be corporates’ funding costs, which rose sharply during 2008, as this chart from former Fed chair Ben Bernanke’s Nobel Prize address highlights:   Another factor is what John Maynard Keynes termed “animal spirits”.  Hyman Minsky — an economist who, rather than assume Great Depressions were a thing of the past, asked what circumstances could create another one — placed the impact these animal spirits have on credit conditions at the heart of his work. From Charles Kindleberger’s’ Manias, Panics and Crashes:  “Minsky argued that the growth of bank credit has been very unstable; at times the banks as lenders have become more euphoric and have lent freely and then at other times they have become extremely cautious and let the borrowers ‘swing in the wind’.”  While looking at polls such as this month’s edition of the Fed’s quarterly survey of loan officers will offer some sign of whether banks are indeed about to let their borrowers “swing”, determining whether the global economy is resilient enough to stomach a fresh bout of banking turmoil will take some time.  In the meantime, it’s important for us to be less like economics professors of decades past and more like Minsky, taking nothing for granted.  Other readables Nigel Lawson, one of the UK’s most renowned chancellors of the exchequer, died this week. Our obit. Investors in the pound are quids in. Want to buy a dinosaur? Here’s how.

Friendshoring has meant that companies are looking to shift some of their Asian manufacturing out of China to other regional hubs. But, as this excellent graphic highlights, those ambitions might be constrained by a lack of ports infrastructure. (More here.)

"A bit more fear, uncertainty and doubt about crypto is welcome","The demise of FTX has delivered a tough lesson in the guiding principles of money management","The silver lining to the spectacular collapse of FTX is hard to see if you are one of the 1mn or so creditors in the crypto exchange’s bankruptcy proceedings. That mix of professional groups and individuals will struggle to get any of their money back. Even the new chief executive, a man who once oversaw the liquidation of Enron, no less, said that it was the most shambolic corporate failure he had ever seen.  The whole episode “undermines trust in financial markets”, Citadel’s chief Ken Griffin said in an interview with Bloomberg this week. “The confidence of a generation in financial markets has also been shaken. That’s really awful because the 20-something-year-olds to 40-year-olds who have are so engaged with crypto, they have got to save for their retirement, and if they don’t believe or trust in financial markets, this is a huge problem.” I wonder whether the opposite might be true. Properly regulated markets may not be perfect, but they suddenly look much more attractive.  Beyond those directly affected, this explosion in crypto hubris certainly appears to have done no harm. The generally upbeat tone in stock markets suggests that fund managers in other asset classes are distinctly unruffled. Stocks in the crypto sphere have suffered, for sure. Shares in Coinbase, the crypto exchange, have dropped 16 per cent or so since FTX hit the skids, but after a decline of more than 80 per cent since they listed last year, who’s counting? Galaxy Digital — the self-styled “Goldman Sachs of crypto” — has suffered a 19 per cent share price decline. MicroStrategy, the software group moonlighting as a crypto fund, has shed about a third of its value. Between them, and retail broker Robinhood, which dabbles in crypto and counts FTX’s former chief executive as a shareholder, the market capitalisation has dropped more than $6bn to $23bn, according to calculations by UBS.  But some perspective helps here. At $23bn, these companies are together worth just 8 per cent of Meta, UBS notes. The stress is real, but the impact on the wider world is minimal. In addition, some of the worst fears among regulators around contagion have not materialised. Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal & General Investment Management, says he has fielded numerous questions from clients on whether the FTX failure could infect core financial markets. “We think probably not,” he says. “Where it becomes systemic is when it gets into the mainstream finance system through banks. If banks take large losses on crypto, that leads to liquidations elsewhere.” So far, though, that does not seem to be the case.  Perhaps more importantly, the demise of FTX has delivered a tough lesson in two of the guiding principles of money management: do your homework, and keep it simple.  If you ask enough questions about crypto, or express enough scepticism about its grander claims, the true believers will accuse you of spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt, or “FUD”. This is one of the greatest insults they can level at those who have declined to jump on board with the speculative fervour. The problem is not the tokens, or the peculiar new exchanges, they say. It is your ignorance.  It turns out that the world needs more FUD. The dirty little secret here is that too many otherwise rational financiers are routinely failing to ask basic questions about the companies they do business with. Top-flight venture capital firms, each of which threw in hundreds of millions of dollars, have written off investments in FTX altogether. One of them, Sequoia, went to the trouble of writing a near-14,000-word article about the genius of the now disgraced former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried. Singaporean investment house Temasek has said its $275mn backing of the exchange was “misplaced”. But it defended its “extensive” eight-month due diligence process. It is hard to imagine what it spent eight months doing, exactly. The bankruptcy filings paint a picture of a cartoonishly amateur collection of FTX executives hopelessly out of their depth and playing fast and loose with the rules. If venture capital firms lose money on that, so be it. The problem is that their backing really does lend credibility. Some crypto hedge fund managers have said they parked money with FTX because they assumed venture capital firms had done the due diligence. This is nuts. “In VC, the longer you do due diligence, the higher the risk that you will lose the deal,” says one former executive in this space. “There’s a race to the bottom.” FTX is not the first example of this, of course. But the profile of this case might just help to encourage investors to think for themselves.  Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney made this point in a lecture in 2020. “If someone explains something to you in finance . . . and it doesn’t make sense, ask the person to repeat the rationale, and if that response still doesn’t make sense, you should run.” Griffin is right to worry about the fate of those stung by the FTX disaster. But if this gives them a nudge towards exercising more FUD, that may be a good thing.  katie.martin@ft.com","18.11.2022"
"Eurozone bank lending predicted to fall for first time since 2014","EY expects it will be harder for cash-strapped companies to borrow next year","Eurozone banks are expected to cut lending next year for the first time since 2014 as countries across the region fall into recession. Banks will reduce their lending in the face of rising interest rates and volatile economic conditions, making it harder for cash-strapped companies to borrow, according to a report by consultancy EY. Across the eurozone, lending by banks will fall by 1.8 per cent next year, EY predicts, after rising 4.6 per cent this year.  The report also stated rising energy prices, interest rates and inflation — combined with falling real household incomes — would lead to a drop in demand for loans from consumers. “The region’s economies are facing recession, and a contraction in borrowing driven by reduced demand and supply is forecast as consumers, businesses and banks become more cautious,” said Omar Ali, partner at EY. “The short-term economic impact will be felt universally, but small businesses are likely to struggle most if access to finance is constrained.” However, the consultancy predicted that lending in the eurozone would pick up after next year, rising 2.7 per cent in 2024 and 3.7 per cent in 2025, assuming the war in Ukraine does not escalate further, inflation falls, energy prices stabilise and confidence returns. Lending to companies is expected to drop 2.7 per cent next year, its weakest level in a decade, as companies grapple with higher borrowing costs, sluggish economic activity, supply chain challenges and the rising cost of capital goods. Consumer borrowing is predicted to fall 1.4 per cent in 2023 as the impact of inflation on incomes means consumers are less likely to buy expensive products.  EY predicted banks would be hit with a 2.6 per cent rise in loan losses this year — rising to 5 per cent in 2025 — as companies and households struggle to repay debt.  But the rates will be lower than in previous economic downturns because banks tightened their lending criteria after the financial crisis. In 2013, loan losses in the eurozone peaked at 8.4 per cent. Germany and Italy are the two economies expected to see the biggest drop in lending next year — at 1.7 and 1.8 per cent, respectively — as they suffer the economic consequences of higher energy prices. At the FT’s recent Banking Summit, UBS chair Colm Kelleher said Brexit and the stalling of the EU’s banking union project meant lending would be likely to slow significantly in a recession.  “I think Europe is going to be relatively sterile ground for the future,” he said.","04.12.2022"

For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog  Good evening. The semiconductor showdown between the US and China stepped up a notch today as Washington tried to rally allies for its battle with Beijing against a backdrop of growing mutual suspicion and geopolitical tensions.   As South Korean president President Yoon Suk Yeol arrives in DC for a state visit, the White House has asked his country’s chipmakers not to fill market gaps in China if Beijing bans the sale of chips from America’s Micron, one of the three big companies in the DRam memory chip market alongside South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix. China’s move is retaliation for US attempts to prevent it from obtaining or producing advanced semiconductors and is seen as a litmus test of how far Beijing is willing to take action against US businesses. The US at the same time is attempting the difficult task of breaking its dependence on China by reshoring production, an exercise described by the founder of Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest chip producer, as a “very expensive exercise in futility”.  Semiconductor companies meanwhile have signalled that the industry’s current slowdown is lasting longer than expected as weakening demand for car parts adds to a slump in sales of smartphones and personal computers after the boom times of the pandemic era. The developments follow a sell-off in Asian markets this morning that was prompted by expectations that China will announce wider restrictions on US investment at next month’s G7 summit.   Investors also have the jitters over tensions in the South China Sea. The US at the weekend held war games in the Philippines, a potential front line in a possible future conflict over Taiwan, while Australia today unveiled its biggest strategic shift in defence since the second world war as a reaction to China’s military build-up in the region.   Tensions between China and Europe are also simmering after Beijing’s ambassador to France questioned the legal status of former Soviet nations Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea, before Beijing disowned the remarks. Relations with China are on the agenda at today’s meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg as they seek to “recalibrate” their approach to Beijing.   The EU’s problem, says FT commentator Martin Sandbu, is that it is too often willing to subordinate political strategy to its economic ambitions, with many business leaders still salivating at the size of the Chinese market. “It is time for Europe to learn that what is good for VW is not necessarily good for Europe,” he concludes.

Profit warnings at UK companies surged in the first quarter, particularly among tech businesses, as economic uncertainty left them facing “recession-like conditions”.

"Credit Suisse slumps to biggest annual loss since financial crisis","Revenues at investment bank and wealth management fall in bruising fourth quarter","Credit Suisse has reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 financial crisis and warned it would be unprofitable this year, laying bare the scale of the challenge the bank faces in restoring its fortunes. The lender on Thursday reported a SFr1.4bn ($1.5bn) loss for the fourth quarter, as investment banking revenues slumped and clients pulled money from the group’s wealth management business. The bruising quarter took the bank’s annual loss to SFr7.3bn. Credit Suisse’s shares tumbled as much as 16 per cent to SFr2.72, having fallen more than 69 per cent over the past year and hit an all-time low of SFr2.70 in December.  Customers withdrew SFr111bn from the group in the final three months of the year, with two-thirds of the outflows coming in October, when the bank was hit by rumours on social media about its financial health. The wealth management business accounted for SFr92.7bn of the outflows in the quarter, the bank said, surpassing the SFr61.9bn expected by analysts. Credit Suisse is embarking on a radical restructuring in an attempt to draw a line under crises and return to profit. Under the plan, the group is axing 9,000 of its 52,000-strong workforce, spinning off its investment bank in a move that will also revive the First Boston name and boosting its wealth management business. “Credit Suisse management is undergoing a very difficult and complex process of restructuring,” said JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein. “The franchise is deteriorating so far faster than expected and seems to be ongoing.” The bank on Thursday warned it expected to make another “substantial loss” in 2023 as it absorbed restructuring costs. “This is a year when it bears a large brunt of the restructuring expenses out of our strategic plan,” Credit Suisse chief financial officer Dixit Joshi said, adding that SFr1.6bn of costs would come in 2023, with a further SFr1bn planned for 2024.  Alongside its quarterly results, the bank announced it had completed the acquisition of M Klein & Company, the advisory boutique owned by Michael Klein, the former director who will run Credit Suisse’s spun-off investment bank. Credit Suisse paid $175mn for the business in the form of a $100mn convertible note and $75mn in cash. The deal is expected to eventually cost $210mn, including interest costs and annual payments on the note. Klein has been named chief executive of banking at Credit Suisse and head of the Americas. He has joined the executive board and will report to Ulrich Körner, group chief executive. Korner said the acquisition marked “another milestone in the carve-out of CS First Boston as a leading independent capital markets and advisory business”, adding: “The transaction should further strengthen CS First Boston’s advisory and capital markets capabilities.” Credit Suisse also announced that the first stage of the deal to sell its securitised products business to Apollo was complete, with the new venture to be called Atlas SP Partners. The bank said it expected to book a pre-tax gain of $800mn from the sale and that the deal was due to be completed in the first half of this year. In the final quarter of 2022, Credit Suisse reported a 33 per cent fall in revenues, largely down to a 74 per cent decline in investment banking fees, while wealth management revenues fell 17 per cent and asset management income dropped 28 per cent.  The bank said its group-wise bonus pool for 2023 would be cut in half and confirmed a Financial Times report that senior managers would not receive a bonus. Korner also confirmed plans to motivate senior managers to hit cost-cutting and profitability targets by offering a special SFr350mn bonus. While the results revealed outflows during a bruising quarter, the bank said customers were beginning to return, especially in Switzerland and in the Asia-Pacific region. Credit Suisse said parts of the business had experienced inflows in January, but did not say whether the group as a whole was having outflows reverse. Korner said the bank had personal conversations with 10,000 wealth management clients and 50,000 customers in the domestic business since the end of October and just 2 per cent of clients had closed their accounts with the group. Fellow Swiss wealth managers UBS and Julius Baer both reported an influx of wealth management assets at the tail-end of last year, as clients switched funds from their Credit Suisse accounts. Thomas Hallett, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, described the outflows as “huge”. “This is deeply concerning, in our view,” he said. “At best, some return but at what cost? We expect this to be viewed negatively.” Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","09.02.2023"
"Silicon Valley Bank collapse forces rethink on interest rates and hits bank stocks","Two-year US Treasury bond yields record biggest one-day drop since 1987","The failure of Silicon Valley Bank has torn into global markets, with investors ripping up their forecasts for further rises in interest rates and dumping bank stocks around the world. Government bond prices soared on Monday, with the two-year US Treasury yield recording its biggest one-day drop since 1987, as fund managers raised bets that the Federal Reserve would act to steady the global financial system by leaving interest rates unchanged at its next scheduled monetary policy meeting this month. As recently as last week, markets were braced for another half-percentage point rise. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves with interest rate expectations, fell by 0.59 percentage points to 4 per cent, its lowest level since September. The benchmark 10-year government bond yield slipped 0.14 percentage points to 3.54 per cent.   SVB was taken over by regulators last week after customers raced to withdraw their money in the biggest test of the US financial system since 2008. On Monday, US president Joe Biden sought to reassure Americans that their money is safe, vowing to do “whatever is needed” to protect bank deposits. The Bank of England brokered a deal to sell the UK arm of SVB to HSBC for £1. Still, bank stocks dropped heavily as investors fretted over which other institutions might also come under strain.  In the US, shares in First Republic dropped as much as 79 per cent, and were halted 15 times in the first two-and-a-half hours of trading despite the San Francisco-based bank telling investors it had $70bn in unused liquidity. The bank ended the day down 61.8 per cent.  The KBW banks index, which includes larger US lenders, fell 11.7 per cent. Europe’s Stoxx banks index fell 6.7 per cent, taking its decline since the middle of last week to over 11 per cent, with all 22 stocks in the index in negative territory. Several lenders suffered double-digit declines on Monday alone, including Spain’s Banco Sabadell and Germany’s Commerzbank. Austria’s Bawag Group fell 8 per cent. The failure of SVB and closure of Signature Bank come just months after the shortlived crisis in UK government bonds, underlining the risks buried in the financial system as central banks rapidly lift borrowing costs. Investors and analysts said policymakers would need to tread carefully as they sought to hose down inflation.  “The SVB situation is a reminder that Fed hikes are having an effect, even if the economy has held up so far,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note to clients. “Concerns over bank earnings and balance sheets also add to the negative sentiment for . . . equity markets.” Investors believe recent developments mean the Fed will ease off its campaign to raise interest rates, after weeks of debate over whether it will opt for a 0.5 or 0.25 percentage point increase after its meeting later this month. Refinitiv data now shows traders see a roughly even split between the odds of a quarter-point rise and the Fed leaving rates unchanged.  Goldman Sachs said on Monday that it no longer expected any increase at the Fed’s meeting ending on March 22 “in light of recent stress in the banking system”. Meanwhile, Japanese bank Nomura on Monday said that it was now expecting the Fed to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points at its March meeting.  The shake-up in bond markets was substantial. Germany’s interest rate-sensitive two-year bond yield plummeted to a low of 2.4 per cent on Monday, as bond markets rallied sharply in response to fading expectations of further increases in borrowing costs. The rate has fallen from the 14-year high of 3.3 per cent it hit last week, showing how sharply investors have repriced their rate expectations since SVB’s collapse. Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income, said he believed the rally in government bonds was misplaced. “It’s way too big of a move. The markets are overreacting massively; they completely forgot about inflation,” he said. “This is a massive head fake.”  But some investors and analysts, including George Saravelos, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said the SVB rescue package from the Fed, which includes an offer to absorb government debt and mortgage-backed bonds at above-market prices, represented a new form of quantitative easing — the waves of bond-buying used by policymakers to stabilise the financial system over the past decade and a half.  “Both the speed and end point of the Fed hiking cycle should come down,” Saravelos said, adding that tightening would now be “amplified due to stress in the US banking system”.  Michael Every, an analyst at Rabobank, said the implications of the Fed’s “bailout of Silicon Valley venture capitalists funding Instagram filters that make cats look like dogs” were potentially “enormous”.   “The Fed is de facto allowing a massive easing of financial conditions as well as soaring moral hazard,” he said in a note to clients. Currencies that perform well in times of stress also rallied. The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc both climbed more than 1 per cent against the dollar. The rapid collapse of SVB made market participants “more aware again that the Fed will eventually break something if it keeps raising rates”, said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.  The bank’s collapse had also “taken the wind out the US dollar’s sails” by highlighting risks associated with rising rates, Hardman added. A measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of six international peers fell 0.6 per cent on Monday.

"Credit Suisse set to cut 10% of European investment bankers","Swiss lender steps up wave of job cuts as it prepares to announce second consecutive annual loss","Credit Suisse is gearing up to cut more than 10 per cent of European investment bankers this year, having already let hundreds of staff go in London and Zurich last month, according to people with knowledge of the moves. The crisis-plagued Swiss lender announced in October that it planned to cut as many as 9,000 roles globally over the next three years from its 52,000 workforce. But those plans have stepped up in recent weeks as the bank prepares to announce its second consecutive annual loss next month. Analysts are expecting a wave of heavy job cuts across investment banks globally, following on the heels of Goldman Sachs, which kick-started a plan to fire more than 3,000 staff this week.  Investment banking revenues were hit severely last year and lenders are under pressure to cut costs, having bulked up on hiring over the past two years. Credit Suisse is under more acute stress than its peers, given it suffered huge client withdrawals in October following social media rumours about its financial health and has racked up a succession of quarterly losses over the past three years. The initial wave of 2,700 global redundancies in December included 540 job cuts in Switzerland and as many as 200 in London. Credit Suisse employs more than 5,000 people in London and 16,000 in Switzerland.  Consultations over the next round of redundancies started before Christmas, with more than 10 per cent of investment banking jobs in Europe under discussion, according to people with knowledge of the talks. A final decision is expected next month.  The lender employs around 17,000 investment bankers globally, with its main centres in New York and London.  In some of Credit Suisse’s smaller European outposts, as many as a third of jobs are threatened as the bank restructures its operations in the hope of eliminating overlapping roles and front-office positions. Many investment bankers that survive job cuts in Credit Suisse’s New York office, its main hub outside Europe, have the prospect of joining the planned First Boston spin-off, which will be led by former Credit Suisse director Michael Klein. But there is less certainty about investment banking roles in Europe, given First Boston will be centred on the US market. “It is difficult to know where we will fit in, though it’s clear European activities will be slimmed down over time,” said one Europe-based banker. “We are in wait-and-see mode.” Another lever managers have when it comes to managing costs is cutting the bonus pool, which was reduced by a third last year. Few of Credit Suisse’s investment bankers expect much in the way of a bonus this year, given the annual loss the bank has signalled it will report next month.  But senior managers are eager to offer incentives to wealth managers who have strong personal connections with clients to prevent them defecting to rivals as well as staff working on critical projects. “I expect bonuses in my team to be close to zero,” said one Credit Suisse dealmaker.  “But for the top guys in the private bank, they will get a lot of attention and they will try to retain as many of them as they can.” In just three weeks in October last year, wealth management clients withdrew SFr63.5bn ($68bn) from Credit Suisse, the equivalent of 10 per cent of assets. By comparison, UBS suffered 10 per cent of outflows during an entire year during the global financial crisis. Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann told the Financial Times last month that withdrawals had flattened and clients were returning to the bank. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the prospect of further job cuts or its bonus policy.","14.01.2023"

For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog  Good evening. With Darren enjoying a well-deserved Friday in the sun, I’m with you today to navigate through these disrupted times. Net migration to the UK reached a record high last year with an estimated 606,000 migrants arriving. This is according to according to data published by the Office for National Statistics yesterday.   While data suggests that people are arriving mostly to work, study or for humanitarian reasons, the number falls short of estimates from the Centre for Policy Studies putting potential net migration from 700,000 to 997,000. The figures prompted fresh promises by prime minister Rishi Sunak to reduce the number of migrants — the Conservative party made an election pledge to reduce the numbers of people coming to the UK to live and work — but he acknowledged the difficulty amid the UK’s labour shortages. On ITV’s This Morning show, Sunak said: “We’ve got to be sensitive to the needs of the NHS, of the economy, but fundamentally the numbers are too high, I’m going to bring them down.”  The 606,000 figure is an increase of 118,000 from a year earlier. However, for the first time, the ONS included asylum seekers, who make up almost a fifth of the total. This reinvigorates long-established questions over whether the UK’s net migration statistics are fit for purpose. ONS estimates used to be based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS), a tourism and travel questionnaire conducted in airports, which the ONS has long admitted is flawed. The majority of people arriving in the UK — estimated at 925,000 — are non-EU nationals, many of whom have arrived from Ukraine and Hong Kong through established humanitarian schemes.  Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced on Tuesday that from next January most international students will be banned from bringing family members with them when they come to the UK to study.  In a written statement, she argued that her package of immigration reforms struck “the right balance between acting decisively on tackling net migration and protecting the economic benefits that students can bring to the UK”. But net migration is not merely an economic issue. Today Reuters reports that a boat carrying 500 migrants, including a newborn baby and pregnant women, disappeared in the central Mediterranean. Alarm Phone, a group that picks up calls from migrant vessels, said it lost contact with the boat on Wednesday morning and Italian NGO Emergency said yesterday that it had unsuccessfully looked for the missing boat for 24 hours. Meanwhile, in response to rising pressure over Sunak’s failure to reduce migration, Bloomberg reports that the UK government is planning to deport thousands of asylum seekers per month from next year.

Need to know: UK and Europe economy UK retail sales grew more than expected in April, rebounding after bad weather hit spending in March. According to data published today by the ONS, the quantity of goods bought in Britain rose 0.5 per cent between March and April. This beat analysts’ expectations, as polled by Reuters, who expected a small rise of 0.3 per cent, following a month-on-month drop of 1 per cent in March.  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has backed higher interest rates to curb soaring inflation even if it tips Britain into recession. He told Sky News: “It is not a trade-off between tackling inflation and recession. In the end, the only path to sustainable growth is to bring down inflation.”   Ministers are also considering reforms to the £39bn Pension Protection Fund that protects company pension plans that could unlock tens of billions of pounds for investment in UK businesses. British Airways has cancelled more than 140 flights ahead of the bank holiday weekend as it struggles to resolve a computer glitch that affected passengers’ ability to check in remotely. This provides little reassurance to people hoping to book summer holiday flights and who already grappling with rapidly rising costs.

The Turkish lira has fallen to 20 to the dollar for the first time as polls predict victory for president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in this weekend’s election run-off. Investors are increasingly concerned that a victory for Erdoğan, who has led Turkey for two decades, will continue unconventional policies that economists blamed for triggering runaway inflation.

Both White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill suggested that talks were in a better place, with President Joe Biden saying yesterday: “Speaker McCarthy and I have had several productive conversations and our staff continue to meet as we speak as a matter of fact — and they’re making progress.” However, this doesn’t stop others calling for deep structural reforms. In a sign of a tightening credit squeeze in the US, more large companies are sheltering in bankruptcy court as interest rates rise. Eight companies with more than $500mn in liabilities have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May, with five filing in one 24-hour period last week.

"Big coal miners’ profits triple as demand surges ","Companies defy long-term decline with $97bn earnings bonanza in 2022  ","The world’s largest coal mining companies tripled their profits in 2022 to reach a total of more than $97bn, defying expectations for an industry that was thought to be in terminal decline. As global demand for the fuel rose to record levels, total earnings from coal operations at the world’s 20 largest coal miners reached $97.7bn during the most recent 12-month period for which financial information is available, compared with $28.2bn during the same period a year earlier, according to Financial Times research and data from S&P Capital IQ. Many countries that once pledged to quit coal have turned back to it as a reliable source of heat and power as energy security concerns became a top priority following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   The biggest money makers were Glencore, whose coal earnings were $13.2bn in the 12 months ending on June 30; China Shenhua, which made $12.2bn during that time; and BHP, which brought in $9.5bn, mainly from production of metallurgical coal. Just a year after the UN COP26 climate summit pledged to “phase down” coal, demand for the fossil fuel has instead grown, boosted by high gas prices and the European energy crisis. Global coal demand rose 1.2 per cent to reach a record high in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2022, the benchmark price for high-quality thermal coal in Europe was $295 on average — double the levels of the previous year, and nearly four times higher than the average price between 2010 and 2020, according to Argus Media. As a result, coal mining companies have experienced a huge and unexpected improvement in their fortunes.  The coal division of Anglo American, the world’s fifth-largest producer outside China of the metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, swung from losses of $34mn in the 12 months ending on June 30 2021 to earnings of $2.5bn a year later. The biggest increase in coal profits was at BHP, where they surged 3,200 per cent, from $288mn in the 12 months ending on June 30 2021 to $9.5bn a year later. BHP is the world’s largest producer of metallurgical coal outside China.  At Glencore, coal earnings rose to $13.2bn, compared with $1.2bn during the same period a year earlier.  “The seaborne producers are the big winners,” said Myles Allsop, analyst at UBS. Companies that mine coal that is exported and traded internationally have had bigger gains than the state-owned coal miners that sell to their domestic market. “The Ukraine war has triggered the extreme tightness in the coal market,” said Allsop, adding that sanctions had blocked Russian coal from the European market.  Before the boom in coal prices, many of the biggest miners outside of China and India were busy paring back their coal operations.  This was the rationale behind the decisions of BHP and Anglo American to dispose of their respective stakes in the Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia, which exports high-quality thermal coal to Europe.  In January, they sold their combined 66 per cent stake to Glencore for $101mn in cash and other considerations, giving the Switzerland-based commodities group, which already owned 33 per cent, full ownership of the asset.   Cerrejón generated $2bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation during the first half of 2022, many times the purchase price. “It probably looks like the best deal anyone has ever seen,” said Ben Davis, mining analyst at Liberum Capital.

"Four ways to fix the bank problem ","It is not clear how bad this crisis is going to be but reform is urgently needed","Banks are designed to fail. And so they do. Governments want them to be both safe places for the public to keep their money and profit-seeking takers of risk. They are at one and the same time regulated utilities and risk-taking enterprises. The incentives for management incline them towards risk-taking, just as the incentives for states incline them towards saving the utility when risk-taking blows it up. The result is costly instability. If one thing is clear about the events of the last two weeks, it is that the vaunted reforms introduced after the global financial crisis have not changed any of this that much, or at least not enough. Yes, leverage of banking systems has fallen since the crisis. But it remains dangerously high. According to the Federal Reserve, on March 8 2023, the difference between the book value of the assets and debt liabilities of US commercial banks was $2,137bn. This slice of equity backed assets that were notionally worth $22,800bn. But a recent paper suggests that mark-to-market losses are already around $2tn. A general run would force these losses into the open and wipe out the equity. To prevent this, the authorities may have to protect all deposits.  Nice words were uttered about the need for orderly resolution of failing banks, with equity the first claim to be wiped out. But, lo and behold, that is not what happened in saving Credit Suisse. Equity holders retained value and the state also provided them with guarantees indirectly, by guaranteeing UBS. Yet, we are told by the Swiss finance minister, “This is no bailout. This is a commercial solution.” It is indeed a bailout. It might be the least costly solution overall. But this is not how the post-2008 crisis regime was supposed to work. I am not that surprised. At this stage, it is still not clear how bad this crisis is going to be. But it is already evident that the reforms after the last one, though vastly better than nothing, were not enough, especially after the Trump administration tampered with them. They have not guaranteed a crisis-proof system. They have not provided a smooth way to resolve a bank in crisis, especially if the latter risks becoming systemic.  So what might be done? There are four broad approaches to reform. First, let the market prevail, as Ken Griffin of Citadel has argued. Alas, the functions of the banks in providing money and credit are too vital to allow this. The notion that the government guarantee of deposits creates moral hazard is also complicated. Depositors are unable to monitor the soundness of banks in real time: the absence of insurance would just make them more jittery. But its presence is clearly a subsidy to shareholders and so encourages higher leverage and greater risk-taking.  Second, tighten up current regulation. All banks with deposits that are de jure or de facto insured need to be regulated for capital soundness and liquidity in the same way. The decision to take Silicon Valley Bank out of the regulatory net for systemically significant banks was a mistake, because anything can trigger a panic if a sufficiently large number of banks have similar vulnerabilities. Also, while extending deposit insurance, increase insurance premia and link them to the risk-characteristics of banks, such as leverage. Again, make stress tests universal and brutally realistic on all risks, including interest rates.  Third, go well beyond business as usual in increasing the robustness of banks. One recommendation suggested a move to three-to-one leverage instead of the 10- or 20-to-one now common. An alternative proposal is to force banks to be funded by debt that converts automatically into equity as market valuations decline. The above ideas would go with strict marking of their accounts to market. A proposal from Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, is for banks to match deposits to their liquid assets. The latter would include a pre-agreed value of collateral against lender-of-last-resort lending. This should guarantee liquidity at all times. Finally, penalties on management of failed banks should be imposed, reflecting the reality that these are utilities. Fourth, abandon this attempt to combine the provision of money with risky loans in one sort of business. This would have two complementary elements.  Liabilities to the public that are supposed to be perfectly liquid and redeemed at par (“money”) should be matched one-to-one with similar assets. This could be done by forcing intermediaries to hold reserves at the central bank or similarly liquid government liabilities. This is the famous “Chicago Plan”. But members of the public could now hold central bank money directly. That was impossible when access to banking required branch networks but it would now be possible for everyone to hold central bank digital currencies that are perfectly safe, in any quantity. This idea would make the central bank the monopoly supplier of money in the economy. Management of the digital payment system could then be handed over to technology companies. The money created by central banks could be used to fund government (by replacing government bonds) or be invested in other ways.  Meanwhile, risk-intermediation could be done by mutual funds, whose value would move with the market. Less radically, the intermediation might be done by banking institutions, but ones funded by a mixture of equity, bonds and time deposits, not sight deposits. No one is yet ready for these last approaches. But the second and third must be on the agenda. Banking stands revealed as a part of the state masquerading as part of the private sector. At the least, it needs to be far more robust. Ideally, it would be radically transformed. martin.wolf@ft.com Follow Martin Wolf with myFT and on Twitter Letters in response to this article:  It should be more difficult to withdraw large deposits / Henry Birdseye Weil, Senior Lecturer, MIT Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA, US A word of caution around one of your banking ‘fixes’ / From Steve H Hanke and Matt Sekerke, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US Limited liability is crux of the moral hazard problem / From Charles Goodhart, London School of Economics, London W14, UK","21.03.2023"
"Eurozone set to avoid recession this year as economists’ gloom lifts","Sharp about-turn in sentiment comes as IMF indicates it will upgrade its global economic forecasts ","The eurozone will avoid a recession this year, according to a widely-watched survey of economists, which illustrates the sharp about-turn in global economic sentiment in the past couple of weeks. As recently as last month, analysts surveyed by Consensus Economics were predicting the bloc would plunge into recession this year. But this month’s survey found that they now expect it to log growth of 0.1 per cent over the course of 2023. This is thanks to lower energy prices, bumper government support and the earlier-than-anticipated reopening of the Chinese economy, which is set to boost global demand. The upgrade comes after officials and business leaders at this week’s annual World Economic Forum in Davos also embraced a more upbeat outlook, and the IMF signalled that it would soon upgrade its forecasts for global growth.  Economists had feared that Europe would be among the hardest-hit areas of the global economy this year due to its exposure to the economic consequences of Russia’s war with Ukraine. Just weeks ago IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that “half of the European Union will be in a recession” during 2023.  Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING Bank, described the about-turn in economists’ forecasts as “a recession that never came”.  Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The threat of the feared energy crisis [is] retreating, and inflation [is] climbing down more rapidly than expected.”  “Our perceptions have changed quite radically since October,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, adding government support had been more generous than expected, while the auto sector had rebounded more strongly than predicted.  There is now less than a 30 per cent chance of a recession, down from the estimated 90 per cent last summer, according to Anna Titareva, economist at UBS. She said that the easing of supply chain disruptions, a strong labour market and excess savings explained the eurozone’s economic resilience, and Europe has been successful in filling its gas storage in recent months, which has greatly reduced fears of gas rationing. The recent sharp fall in wholesale gas prices back to levels last seen before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also helped boost the economic outlook. JPMorgan this week raised its 2023 eurozone GDP forecast to 0.5 per cent after anticipating natural gas prices would be about €76 per megawatt hour, rather than its previous expectation of €155.   Speaking at Davos this week Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said the economic prognosis was looking “a lot better” than feared. Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s deputy managing director, said China’s decision last month to ease Covid-19 restrictions was one reason why the fund had become more optimistic.   Sven Jari Stehn, economist at Goldman Sachs, said firmer demand in China would “boost European trade significantly, especially in Germany”.  German chancellor Olaf Scholz said last week he was “convinced” Europe’s largest economy would not fall into a recession. Banque de France governor François Villeroy de Galhau said: “For Europe, we should avoid a recession this year, which I wouldn’t have said with such confidence three months ago.” Some economists still expect a recession. Silvia Ardagna, economist at Barclays Bank, said that while the downturn would not be as deep as previously thought, the eurozone economy would still contract for two successive quarters — meeting the technical definition of a recession.  Kenningham warned aggressive rate increases by the ECB could lead to a weak recovery.  Lagarde signalled in Davos the ECB would raise rates by 50 basis points at its February and March meetings. The deposit rate has already increased by 2.5 percentage points to 2 per cent since June last year, a pace of tightening that eurozone economies have not experienced before.  “The eurozone economy may avoid a recession but interest rates may need to stay high for a prolonged period,” said Kenningham. “It looks like we may get — at worst — a mild recession, but that will be followed by a weak recovery.”  Letter in response to this article: Verbs to avoid — plunge, plummet and brace / From Nathaniel Norman, New York, NY, US","22.01.2023"
"German reluctance over tanks threatens arms sales, officials warn","European defence co-operation at risk, say Polish, Slovak and industry representatives","Berlin’s reluctance to approve re-exports of German-made tanks to Ukraine is damaging trust in the country’s defence sector, prompting warnings from Polish, Slovak and industry officials that future purchases and military co-operation are at risk.  The EU and Nato have sought to respond to the war in Ukraine by encouraging European governments to work on joint defence projects, but the furore over chancellor Olaf Scholz’s refusal to allow Leopard 2 tanks to be exported to Kyiv has given other countries a reason to question Germany’s partnership credentials, officials told the Financial Times. “It’s always better to go national. If you have to go multinational, there may be some strings attached and there are some lessons learned that are indeed derived from the current crisis,” said Tomasz Szatkowski, Poland’s ambassador to Nato.   “The Leopard case is just one of them,” he added. “And we are implementing those lessons now with the new procurement decisions.” Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Monday that Warsaw would formally apply to Berlin for permission to export Leopards to Ukraine, in a bid to pressure Scholz into approving the tank deliveries. The war in Ukraine has been a boon for German defence producers. The Düsseldorf-based Rheinmetall, which manufactures the cannon and electronics for the Leopard 2 as well as a range of other vehicles and ammunition, has seen its share price more than double since last year’s invasion. A promise by Scholz to overhaul Germany’s armed forces and increase its defence spending also raised market expectations of a flurry of orders for German arms manufacturers. Germany has long been regarded as one of the world’s top manufacturers of tanks. Many countries, including the US, require customers to agree to re-exporting restrictions. But those restrictions usually do not apply to Nato partner countries such as Ukraine. Several defence industry officials said that the country’s arms makers were fearful that the Leopard row would dent the sector’s potential.  One German defence industry lobbyist who declined to be named said his country’s re-exporting rules were seen as stricter than, for instance, France and UK’s. “Although the label ‘made in Germany’ still stands for quality, it is never entirely clear to the customer whether the export permits will be granted,” the lobbyist said. Leopards, which are operated by a dozen EU armies, are widely viewed as well-suited for Ukraine’s needs. Multiple bloc foreign ministers used a meeting in Brussels on Monday to demand Germany agree to their export to Kyiv. “Put simply, it is great news for any of Germany’s competitors in the defence space,” said a second defence industry official. Last May, the EU responded to concerns over the bloc’s defence capabilities by setting up a new body tasked with exploring “future joint procurement projects”. But EU officials said that the Leopards experience could impact appetite for future co-operation with Berlin. “The risk is that this idea takes hold that ‘if the Germans are involved, then we don’t know if we can fully trust it’,” said one bloc official involved in talks over closer defence co-operation. “These are the times when trust is being built,” said Peter Bator, Slovakia’s ambassador to Nato. “If this [permission] is going to be refused by anyone, then it would definitely not contribute to trust.”  Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at the London-based Agency Partners, said that the row risked harming Germany’s plan for pan-European defence industrial co-operation on projects such as a joint fighter jet developed by France, Germany and Spain. Paris and Berlin have also floated plans for a common tank to replace both the Leopard and the French-made Leclerc. “The French are clearly very worried that Germany will not be reliable,” said Tusa. “And what we are seeing now does not help this impression.” Sven Weier, an analyst at the Swiss bank UBS, said that “whether it was tied into frustration [with Berlin] or not, we have already seen evidence for market share loss of German contractors.”  Weier noted that Poland bought tanks from the US and South Korea rather than Germany and that the Czech Republic and Slovakia purchased British combat vehicles. “Some decisions could have been in favour of Rheinmetall but weren’t.” ","24.01.2023"
"UK at risk of losing healthcare innovation race with European rivals, warns Sanofi boss","Chief executive Paul Hudson sounds the alarm over British government’s cuts to research","The UK is at risk of falling behind European competitors in healthcare innovation because of “short-term dramatic measures” the government has taken to plug the country’s deficit, the chief executive of Sanofi has warned.  “If I see how quickly science is developing in France, how quickly innovation is developing in clinical operations in Spain, there is a real risk that other countries take a big lead [over Britain],” said Paul Hudson, the French pharmaceutical company’s chief executive, despite how “brilliant” the UK’s scientific community is.  “Governments and in particular the UK need to be a little bit careful that any short-term dramatic measures against the industry don’t lead to an erosion in the sector and access to medicine for patients,” he added, noting that in the past two years clinical research has declined in the country by 50 per cent.   Hudson said he had called for a stop in cuts to healthcare and life sciences research in conversations with Number 10 and the Treasury. Major pharmaceutical companies have also criticised the scale of clawback costs NHS pricing policies impose on the industry, which accounted for more than a quarter of last year’s UK sales.  Drugmakers signed a voluntary agreement with the UK’s NHS in 2019 to limit any rise in the total branded drug bill to 2 per cent a year. But a combination of the pandemic and an increase in use of more expensive treatments led to unusually high clawbacks in the past two years. The UK department of health and social care said the voluntary pricing agreement with drugmakers had driven “significant improvements” in patient’s access to clinical and cost-effective medicines, while “protecting NHS finances and promoting innovation”. “We will continue to engage with industry to understand the impact on companies,” it added. The comments from Sanofi’s chief executive come amid a wider struggle between big pharmaceutical groups and governments around the world over drug prices, as policymakers have to contend with tight budgets and drugmakers face a tough commercial environment.  Sanofi predicted in annual results released on Friday that it will grow at a more moderate pace this year, after delivering strong sales growth in 2022 driven by its hit Dupixent anti-inflammatory drug, which is used for diseases such as eczema, and vaccines.  Demand for Dupixent is expected to continue to grow — with the company saying it aims to exceed sales of €10bn this year, up from €8.3bn in 2022 — but this will be partly offset by competition from generics for Aubagio, a treatment for multiple sclerosis.  Sanofi reported a fall in sales last year in key areas including immunology and oncology, which the company is investing heavily in, as it seeks to reduce its dependence on Dupixent. It expects to bring two new products to market: Altuviiio, a treatment for haemophilia, and Beyfortus, a vaccine against a common respiratory virus in young children.  Sanofi said adjusted earnings per share, excluding currency movements, would be “in the low single digits” for 2023. They grew 17 per cent to €8.26 per share in 2022 while sales rose 7 per cent to €43bn. Sanofi is pursuing a five-year turnround plan under Hudson, who is in his fourth year at the company’s helm. However, it has faced questions from industry stakeholders about the strength of its drug pipeline even as he presses ahead with changes at the group including exiting categories such as cardiac disease and diabetes while investing heavily in cancer treatments and immunology.  Sanofi’s failure to develop a Covid-19 vaccine despite being one of the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturers has hung over the company, as has the failure of several drugs the company had had in development. Analysts say Hudson needs to embark on a more ambitious dealmaking spree. “M&A is probably on the agenda for 2023,” wrote Michael Leuchten, an analyst at UBS. “We don’t think Sanofi’s valuation pivots on near term estimates but on the company’s ability to create optionality that will eventually allow for an offset of the dependence on Dupixent. Smart capital allocation could change investor perception.” Sanofi’s share price has fallen more than 4 per cent in the past year, a less drastic decline than peers Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Novartis, but its shares have lagged behind peers since Hudson took over leadership of the company.

"Meta shares soar on resilient revenue and $40bn in buybacks","Mark Zuckerberg promises ‘year of efficiency’ as parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp looks to contain costs","Mark Zuckerberg laid out plans to further wrestle Meta’s costs under control in what he deemed a “year of efficiency” for the social media company, as its shares jumped on better than expected sales, guidance for lower expenses and a new $40bn share buyback. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, reported fourth-quarter revenues of $32.2bn on Wednesday, a 4 per cent decline from the year before, but at the top end of its guidance and slightly above analysts’ estimates. The company also cut its 2023 expenses outlook by $5bn and announced an additional $40bn for share buybacks.  Meta shares closed 17.6 per cent higher on Thursday. The gain added almost $88bn to its market value, according to Bloomberg data, largely reversing the $89bn hit at its third-quarter results amid investor anxiety over its costly metaverse bet. By midday, shares were up 25 per cent.  The fourth-quarter results present a rosier picture for Meta, which has been squeezed over the past year by the economic slowdown that prompted marketers to cut their spending, along with heightened competition from TikTok and challenges in tailoring and measuring ad campaigns following Apple’s privacy changes. Still, its profits took a substantial knock in the quarter, which it blamed on a restructuring cost of $4.2bn in the quarter related to facilities consolidation, job cuts and the cancellation of multiple data centres. Net income in the fourth quarter dropped 55 per cent to $4.7bn, compared with consensus estimates for a drop to $6bn. At the start of the call with investors, an upbeat Zuckerberg said his “management theme for 2023 . . . is the year of efficiency”. He said Meta was now focusing on removing some layers of middle management, cutting low-performing projects and deploying artificial intelligence tools to help its engineers be more productive. “There’s going to be some more that we can do to improve our productivity, speed and cost structure,” Zuckerberg said. “2022 was a challenging year. But I think we ended up having made good progress on our main priorities and setting ourselves up to deliver better results this year, as long as we keep pushing on efficiency.” Meta, which had expanded its headcount rapidly since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, has sought to bring down costs as Wall Street has increasingly questioned its lossmaking efforts to build an avatar-filled digital world known as the metaverse.  As with its many other virtual and augmented reality projects, they are not expected to generate returns for many years. In the fourth quarter, revenues from Reality Labs, its metaverse unit, fell to $727mn from $877mn a year ago, while losses were $4.3bn compared with $3.3bn the prior year. In November, Meta announced its biggest headcount reductions, dismissing 11,000 staffers, or about 13 per cent of total employees. It also introduced other measures such as reducing budgets and employee perks, and shrinking its “real estate footprint”. On Wednesday, the company forecast revenues for the current quarter of between $26bn-$28.5bn. It also anticipates 2023 expenses in the range of $89bn-$95bn, down from the prior outlook of $94bn-$100bn, because of “slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue”. It expects a further $1bn in restructuring charges, down from a previous estimate of $2bn.  On the call with analysts, Zuckerberg said the company’s investment in AI was paying off, allowing it to recommend more relevant short-form video content to users for its so-called Reels feature, as well as helping brands to better automate, target and measure their marketing campaigns. He also said he hoped Meta would become “a leader” in generative AI, a fast-emerging technology that can be used to produce novel content such as graphics or literature. “You’ll see us launch a number of different things this year,” Zuckerberg said.  Meta’s growing user base also remained a bright spot. Monthly active users on one or more of its apps rose 4 per cent to 3.74bn in the fourth quarter, while user numbers for the Facebook app specifically rose 2 per cent to 2.96bn. Lloyd Walmsley, analyst at UBS, said in a note that he could “see a path towards double-digit [revenue] growth” come the end of 2023, as well as strong growth in earnings per share. “These results show significant improvement around key overhangs and . . . shares are under-owned by long-term investors in our view.” Additional reporting by Nicholas Megaw","02.02.2023"
"Upbeat European stocks force a rethink among investors","The end of a cheap money era strengthens the case for a trade idea that has long disappointed","“Time to buy Europe” is one of the hardiest perennial trade ideas that somehow never properly takes off. It is a nailed-on certainty that every few months, strategy notes or articles will appear outlining why investors think now is the time to invest in Europe, and not long after that, European stocks will tank. I know because I’ve written this several times myself. In a July 2021 example, fund managers spoke warmly of the euro area’s positive corporate earnings revisions, its recovery from the shock of Covid, and a tamer outlook for interest rates than on the other side of the Atlantic. Among other things, these were cited as reasons to add to the already substantial rally that had been running since the initial outbreak of the pandemic.  They were not wrong. By the start of 2022, the Stoxx 600 was about 8 per cent higher. The problem was: no one saw Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coming to knock it off course. By the end of last year, stocks were some 6 per cent below the starting point. The outbreak of war is, to put it mildly, an exogenous shock. No sensible fund manager could have anticipated it in the previous summer. But global investors can be forgiven for thinking Europe is just not worth the bother.  The US S&P 500 had a rough 2022, for sure. But it is still up by more than 50 per cent in the past five years. No major European index can come close to that. Looking at dollar-based MSCI indices to strip currency effects out of comparisons, MSCI Europe is up a paltry 5 per cent, while Germany is down 13 per cent. France’s 17 per cent gain is decent, but not on the same scale as the US. Still, no doubt you can see where this is going, and you are already asking yourself: is it time to buy Europe? At the risk of tempting fate, a lot of investors think it is. In fact, the best strategy is to hop in a time machine, scoot back to October, and buy at the point when risky markets all over the world turned higher for reasons that analysts are still arguing about. The Euro Stoxx 600 index is up by about 20 per cent from that point. If your time machine is malfunctioning, you face a somewhat trickier task. Already, this is proving to be a world-beating asset class for 2023.  This sparkling performance is very much not what investors and analysts were expecting. Underweight positions or outright negative bets were an overwhelming consensus call for 2023, and fund managers were staying away.  But a few things have gone wrong with that, and right with Europe.  One is the weather. We are all amateur meteorologists now, sagely noting that Europe did not get frozen into a recessionary energy crisis over the winter as economists had feared. This, obviously, is not a particularly reliable long-term macroeconomic factor. “Winters happen every year,” as Sonal Desai, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, drily points out. “The warm weather contributed to the lack of a massive recession and that’s not a great thing to hang your hat on.” Still, it has worked this year. The puzzling global ascent in global stocks has also clearly helped. But arguably the biggest boost has come from China. Its speedier-than-expected exit from zero-Covid policies has fanned across Europe, lifting demand for everything from cars, to Germany’s heavy industrial sector, to the luxury stalwarts of France and Italy. It has also helped to lubricate the supply chains that European manufacturing needs. Germany’s Dax is close to a record high. France’s CAC 40 hit a record — just — earlier this month. Italy has not broken new ground, but its index is at some of the strongest levels since the financial crisis of 2008. MSCI’s European luxury index has gained 17 per cent so far this year, and nearly 50 per cent since October. European bank stocks — one of the most avidly avoided sectors on earth since the region’s debt crisis — are nowhere close to their glory days, but they are up 18 per cent this year now that interest rates are back in positive territory. Claudia Panseri, a strategist at UBS Wealth Management, is among those who feel this has further to run. “People have been rethinking,” she says. “Everyone was so negative at the end of last year, expecting an energy crisis and huge pressure on earnings.” Now, new money is coming in from institutional investors, including some switching out of the US and in to Europe, where valuations are much lower, she says. Zooming out a little, that reflects one of the key foundations to this theme. One of the reasons the US has trounced Europe in market performance for decades is its heavy weighting towards tech, including shares in lossmaking companies that made sense to some investors, at least while returns on safer assets were tiny, if they existed at all. Investors were willing to wait for profits to land later. High inflation and aggressive rises in interest rates have put a stop to that. Now, says Panseri, tech valuations are under question and “a lot of people want to reduce exposure to the growth sector”.  Slow and steady has long been Europe’s selling point, but it never really worked out in the easy money era. Now there’s at least a chance it will stick. katie.martin@ft.com ","24.02.2023"
"Federal Reserve set to signal plans to keep raising rates even as inflation eases","US central bank officials expected to shift down to quarter-point rise at first gathering of the year","The Federal Reserve is this week set to signal it will press ahead with its campaign of interest rate rises, even as it slows the pace of increases amid signs inflation has peaked. Policymakers at the US central bank are expected to implement a quarter-point increase at their first gathering of the year, lifting the fed funds rate to a new target range of 4.50 per cent to 4.75 per cent. The Fed previously raised the federal funds rate by unusually large increments — including four consecutive 0.75 percentage point rises last year — in an attempt to tame spiralling prices. At its previous meeting in December, it opted for a half-point increase.  However, lingering scepticism about how quickly inflation will keep falling has put pressure on the central bank to maintain a hawkish stance to ward off speculation that it plans to pause its monetary tightening campaign imminently. “I expect the step down to a 25-basis-point rate hike to come with ‘we have more work to do’ language,” said Jonathan Pingle, a former Fed economist now at UBS. “This is going to be a meeting where they’re going to try not to be too dovish.” The policy statement that accompanies the rate decision will be closely scrutinised for any changes to the guidance provided since last March, which has said the Federal Open Market Committee expects “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate”.  Many expect the Fed to hold that line or tone it down minimally, and for chair Jay Powell to double down on the message at Wednesday’s press conference.  Fed officials want to buy time to assess economic data, which has become more mixed as their previous tightening measures have taken effect. Lael Brainard, the vice-chair who is among the most dovish FOMC members, recently cautioned the “full effect on demand, employment, and inflation of the cumulative tightening that is in the pipeline still lies ahead”.  Business activity, especially in manufacturing, has already taken a hit alongside the housing sector, while Americans are both spending less readily and more often dipping into savings or taking on debt to cover expenses. Companies are beginning to cut costs, slashing hours for workers and reducing temporary help. Wage growth has slowed but still remains strong amid a tight labour market, keeping pressure on prices across the services sector. Fed governor Christopher Waller has warned against being “head-faked” by positive data while underlying inflation remains too high, saying he needs to see a full six months’ worth of evidence to feel confident in pausing rate rises. “The hard decision [of when to pause] isn’t quite here yet,” said Ellen Meade, who served as a senior adviser to the Fed’s board of governors until 2021. “Powell probably doesn’t want to stop until he thinks he’s ready to stop and hold for a while.” Most officials say the fed funds rate will need to go above 5 per cent and for that level to be maintained through 2024. However, traders on Wall Street disagree, pricing in a peak policy rate of less than 5 per cent, with roughly half a percentage point of cuts by December. Financial conditions have also loosened, threatening to counteract some of the tightening under way. “Market-determined rates are where the rubber really meets the road in transmitting tighter conditions and where some of the strongest impact on the economy occurs,” said Dennis Lockhart, former president of the Atlanta Fed. “A step down to a quarter of a point move could encourage the narrative in the markets of a decline in rates in the second half of the year. This is not necessarily what the committee wants as a total inflation-fighting package.”  Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice-chair, said the central bank can defend against easier financial conditions with its rhetoric and, if necessary, higher interest rates than it has signalled. Lorie Logan, president of the Dallas Fed and a voting member on the FOMC, acknowledged as much in a recent speech, when she said the central bank “can and, if necessary, should adjust our overall policy strategy to keep financial conditions restrictive even as the pace slows”.  Lockhart said: “Their mission this year is to wring excess inflationary pressures thoroughly out of the economy [and] I don’t think they are of a mind to let up too early. The Fed is playing a big-stakes, long-term game.”","30.01.2023"
"US’s Yellen and China’s Liu seek to ease concerns over economic tensions","Beijing and Washington try to counter fears with first meeting of two most senior economic officials in three years","China has said it would welcome a visit by Janet Yellen this year after the US Treasury secretary met vice-premier Liu He in Zurich, marking the first top-level economic meeting between the powers since Joe Biden took office. The meeting, which comes as US-China relations remain fraught over issues from Taiwan to trade and technology, was described by both sides as “candid”. In separate statements, both sides sought to ease concerns about a further deterioration in ties between the world’s two largest economies.  Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the two officials agreed in a three-hour meeting that their economic and trade teams would “continue to maintain communication at all levels” and that Beijing would welcome a visit from Yellen “at a suitable time this year”.  The Treasury said both sides agreed that it was “important for the functioning of the global economy to further enhance communication around macroeconomic and financial issues”. It added that Yellen “looks forward to travelling to China” and to welcoming her Chinese counterparts in the US. The Zurich talks come two months after Biden and President Xi Jinping held their first in-person meeting as leaders at the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. The two tried to halt the deterioration in relations that reached a new low when China held huge military exercises around Taiwan in August. Secretary of state Antony Blinken will travel to China in early February, in what will be the first visit by a US cabinet official in more than two years.  But tensions have remained elevated since Bali. In December, the US added three dozen Chinese companies to an export blacklist in a bid to prevent them from obtaining high-end American technology. That came two months after the US introduced sweeping new rules designed to make it much harder for China to obtain, or produce, high-end semiconductors. The Zurich meeting came one day after Liu spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he reassured the business audience that China was mostly “recovering to a normal state of affairs” following its recent abrupt end to its zero-Covid regime. Yellen did not attend Davos. As the US and Chinese officials met, UBS chair Colm Kelleher said at Davos that a deterioration in US-China ties remained one of the biggest global risks, particularly an “event that could cause a geopolitical deterioration on the America-China relationship”. He sparked controversy last year when he told a forum in Hong Kong that global bankers were “very pro-China”.  JPMorgan’s investment banking chief Daniel Pinto said on Tuesday that US-China tensions appeared to be easing with better communication, and as officials in Beijing and Washington focused more on domestic issues.  Kurt Campbell, the top White House official for Asia, said last week that the two countries were trying to set a “floor” under the relationship. But Biden’s China policy is expected to attract scrutiny from Capitol Hill after the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives this month. In a separate discussion at Davos on Tuesday, Carmine Di Sibio, EY chief executive, put his level of concern about a potential decoupling of the US and Chinese economies at nine out of 10. He said companies were trying to convince the US administration that “we need investments from China, we need to invest in China”.  “But the politics are really in the way here and I am worried that they’re not getting better,” Di Sibio said. “In particular, in the United States they’re not getting better because both sides of the [political] aisle have this as a major part of the agenda and . . . it’s the one thing that they can agree on.” However, Anne Richards, chief executive of Fidelity International, said the realisation that a complete economic decoupling would be catastrophic “means that there is a genuine desire on both the US and Chinese side to find the areas where co-operation can happen”.  Yellen’s meeting with Liu came as she prepared to visit Senegal, Zambia and South Africa. She has criticised Beijing’s approach to debt relief in defaulting developing economies, saying that “the barrier to making greater progress is one important creditor country, namely China”.

The signature, an “artistic rendering” of J Pierpont Morgan’s own John Hancock, exists in JPM branding to “reinforce the rich heritage of our organisation”. JPM’s 2009 ‘brand tool box’ inefficiently adds: The stylized signature is intended to stand for the entire company. Therefore, it is a stylized design element meant to represent far more than one person. In three words: Bold, dated, overwrought.  18. UBS   First impressions: Simplicity without elegance. Reddish-brown. Tight leading across big, unfeeling blocks of justified text. Dispassionate blue links. Charts uncaringly dispatched to later pages. Frankly, this is about as bad as a simple note can be. Where’s the love?  Details: Adrian Frutiger shows up again, but with his self-titled Frutiger typeface rather than Univers. It’s a reliable and ubiquitous option, although to our eyes the tight leading of the body text makes it harder to read. Conventional logic roughly runs: the smaller the text, the looser the lines ought to be. We like the serif heading typeface, which is a custom brew called UBS Headline that seems to owe a lot to Walbaum, a classic in the Didone style. The origin is German but the effect is Italianate, which is a nice blend for a Swiss company. It looks a little lost amid all that sans serif though. Colour-wise, UBS lacks boldness when applying its signature red, and the less said about that brown the better. Incidentally this is a as good a time as any to remind readers of UBS’s weird corporate dress codes. In three words: Simple ≟ beautiful.  17. Exane BNP Paribas  First impressions: There’s a loose feeling at the top of this note that all the elements don’t want to be seen together. The ink-wasting black band is quite distinct, but the overall sense is of unease.  Details: In note dominated by unfeeling Arial, the only threat of personality comes from the heading, in Zuzana Licko’s Bodoni-inspired Filosofia. Exane wears this dash of characterful type awkwardly: it’s like pairing a T-shirt and blue jeans with an cravat. In three words: Bon courage, Exane!  16. Cenkos  First impressions: This looks like the packaging for something you’d be embarrassed to ask for at a pharmacy counter. Details: Cenkos primarily leans on Calibri, the nice-but-oh-so-dull typeface that took the world by light breeze as the default option in Microsoft Office 2007. Calibri’s so generic now that we tend to zone out looking at it: “The interim dividend has been increased apply morning and night, consult your GP if itching occurs…”. There’s plenty of information packed in without total overcrowding though, so Cenkos gets points for that. In three words: Walk on by.  15. Goldman Sachs   First impressions: Unlike its management, Goldman’s research notes play clean. Readers are treated to well-spaced lines, clear contact details for the analysts and plenty of white space. This is about as vanilla as a note can look — even the colour accents are fairly muted. Details: The body typeface is Univers, a dependable neo-grotesque created in the 1950s by Swiss designer Adrian Frutiger. Prominent uses include many London street signs and the eBay logo. The blue being used (#7399c6) is GS’s straight-down-the-line primary blue, described in its style guide as its “hero color”. Complementary yellows and mid-tones are available, which the design team says might be used “in order to capture our target’s attention, and set the firm apart from the competition”. For sellside, however, it seems that being Goldman was considered to be enough.  In three words: Clean, safe, boring  14. Jefferies  First impressions: At first glance, there’s an admirable amount of info packed onto this page. That’s fine on screen with zoom functionality, but hang on — imagine turning up to a meeting with a printed version of this:   Details: The slightly anaemic appearance of Jefferies’ notes stems mainly from heavy use of Roboto’s Light weight. It’s clean, elegant and modern, although it’s definitely putting visual style above maximum readability. Occasional splashes of blue add a bit of interest to an otherwise plain note, which given the dearth of competition is enough to lift Jefferies clear of the relegation zone. In three words: Form over function.  13. Rabobank  First impressions: Rabo, we want to love you. The curse of modern design is uniformity, and many a beautiful bit of idiosyncratic branding or design has been suckified by companies choosing to play it safe. Thankfully, there are nascent signs that this era might be passing — but we’re not sure that this Rabo design ought to make it through. Details: The blue bubble! The gradient orange bubble! The blue and orange bubbles, together! OK, it’s all derived from Rabo’s dope logo, but that block at the top is a horror show, especially with the blue one weirdly tucking behind the orange at the right-hand edge. They play together quite nicely on charts though. All the significant bits of text appear to be Adobe’s Myriad, which is a fine if slightly ageing typeface. Points for the sensible use of one font in a variety of weights and colours. But doesn’t the word spacing feel a little too much? In three words: Blue! Orange! Ahh!  12. Nomura   First impressions: It’s the list’s first example of a classification known as SocGenus. Like the higher-ranked Frenchies, it’s got some bold black chunks and splashes of accent red. Overall, there’s a bit less going on — it just doesn’t spark joy in quite the same way. The red’s a little more muted, the type worse. Details: Once again we find ourselves in the lukewarm embrace of Arial. It’s a hugely popular and reliable typeface but it really does so little. It’s a non-choice. Arial isn’t offensive, and its ubiquity makes it accessible, but it’s just not particularly lovely to look at or read. In three two words, one of which is a portmanteau: Diet SocGen.  11. Credit Suisse   First impressions: Smart, neat, a little desaturated — this isn’t a note out to make a big statement, but it nonetheless delivers some nice surprises. The hierarchy’s good, the type is well set (something the other big Swiss investment bank could certainly take note of). There’s some gentle quirkiness in the title’s straight terminals, giving a turn-of-the-century retrofuturistic look to the whole thing without going too far down that road. For a sometimes reckless bank, this is sensible stuff. Details: Credit Suisse sometimes uses slightly more poppy, saturated colours in its publications, but this note is much more in line with its reserved corporate face.  Fonts are all custom here, a mixture of Credit Suisse Type and Credit Suisse Headline. Other than some slightly weird open kerning before the commas, it looks ok to our eyes — maybe losing some slight points for the slightly gappy effect of the justification, which seems to be exaggerated to the relatively tall, condensed appearance of the text itself. In three words: Clear, cold, technical.  10. Deutsche Bank  First impressions: Is that a 7-column grid? Groovy. There are some interesting things going on with alignments, and the meta headings look a bit . . . random? Does “UK economic notes” need to be so big? The limited colour palette’s tasteful though, as are the flashes of tertiary red brought in via the well-placed sidebar charts. We’ll refrain from jokes about German efficiency. Details: Deutsche, like Goldman, uses Frutiger’s Univers, albeit in its own variation. It plays well with Deutsche’s ultra-modernist logo and is a nod to the 1972 Munich Olympics, where Univers was widely used.  Its research uses a mixture of Deutsche’s distinct dark blue (Pantone 072C), but also liberally splashes out with its bright-blue accent. Brand guidelines call for a 5-10 per cent proportion of bright to dark blue, a rule that has definitely been broken here. In three words: Smart. Too smart?  9. Morgan Stanley   First impressions: Morgan Stanley is a cold plunge. Light text, small bursts of bright colour, plenty of white space. It’s clean, elegant, and unfussy (although scrolling for charts suck). Headline leading’s too generous. A critic might label it dull, even though nothing’s threatening to interfere with their enjoyment of the text. Quick grouse on visual hierarchies. There’s just one large block of blockiness, contrast and colour on this page: the signature-teal “Brands” bar on the right. It’s where we look first when we open this note, which seems wrong. Why is it so prominent? Details: Headlines are in Gloriola, released in 2007 by Tomáš Brousil, a Czech designer. Morgan Stanley had an exclusive licence to the typeface for a period, and it was also once used by the UK’s Channel 5. In charts and some side-matter, Roboto is the weapon of choice. It’s not as trendy as it used to be but it’s airy and legible. In three words: Smart, but distant.  8. Barclays   First impressions: Clean design, plenty of white space, decent hierarchy, splash of colour. Pretty decent, although it doesn’t feel like much more than a + version of Goldmanesque minimalism. Details: Barclays’ notes are set almost exclusively in Source Sans, the first open source typeface made by design industry superpower Adobe. In other words, it’s open and free — which is likely to have some positive externalities in terms of interoperability and accessibility. It’s clean, modern and unpretentious.  The only other font present is Awesome Regular, which offers a selection of icons and dingbats (see left). Wowzers! Barclays’ recognisable cerulean (#00aeef) is present in links and some headers, but the teal ribbon is more mysterious. In Three words: Clear, clean, cold.  7. Bank of America   First impressions: We get BofA’s notes through a web portal, but we can approximate a PDF appearance, mutatis mutandis, by zooming out a bit. First up: good on them for providing a top-item link to an accessible version (not visible in this screenshot) for users of screen-readers. Elsewhere, it’s smart and sensible: colour is used in moderation, the things you need to read first are typically bigger and the ‘Key Takeaway’ box is neat. Details: BofA uses a 1990s-era font called Connections, by Jasper Brik, which we’ll admit we weren’t very familiar with. It’s clear enough though, and the hierarchies are generally very sensible. Disappointingly, our searching yielded no corporate waffle about BofA’s royal blue of choice. It’s nice enough we suppose, and they haven’t compromised readability by aiming for an overly harmonic chart palette. In three words: Two-piece suit.  6. HSBC  First impressions: All the info, right here, right now. Which is good, done right — and few notes manage it better than HSBC. Despite this density, there’s space for some visual interest at the top. It’s not super pretty, but it works. Details: Arial… we’ll just pop a yawn emoji here. 🥱 Univers Next, HSBC’s main brand typeface, is nowhere to be seen (although this is a slightly older note — HSBC flak, please let us known if you’ve had a glow-up). Incidentally, HSBC’s brand spiel says its hexagon logo refers back to its Scottish heritage, which is an odd thing to do in bright red. In three words: Flesh without blood.  5. Numis  First impression: Everything’s so circular, so curved. This is a safety note. It looks like an iOS screenshot. Maybe the analysis is sharp but that’s beyond the scope of this article.  Our eyes are drawn, uncomfortably, to the strangely erotic blue form pictured at the top, which looks like some kind of convoluted sex toy viewed through lightly frosted glass. What does it mean? [Editor’s note: when Numis revealed its bulbous rebrand in last September we tried to engineer a fight between it and Minus, a Scandinavian fashion website whose logo is nearly identical. To their credit, neither side could be goaded into responding.] Details: Numis leans on the delightfully named Poppins, a free geometric offering from Google that embraces circularity. Lines are a bit tight, but we like the judicious use of Numis blue. In three words: wub wub wub  4. SocGen  First impressions: Société Générale is bold and bright, with a fairly dense body-text second offset by decent amounts of white space and accents in its signature red. This is perhaps too much bold, to our eyes, but it’s still a handsome, eye-catching note. Details: Like Barclays, SocGen primarily leans on Source Sans, although its designers have erred towards generally heavier weights and tighter lines.  The signature look comes primarily from the red, a major part of the bank’s graphic design since the late 1980s, when its Dennis The Menace-esque ‘brand identity’ was introduced by design agency Sopha. As SocGen puts it: Red, which is bright and dynamic, is associated with passion and emotion, while black is the colour of solemnity, seriousness, and institutions. Whether that bears any relevance to what is red and what is black here is a matter of perspective. In three words: Fort, distinct, unpretentious.  3. TS Lombard  First impression: TS Lombard’s notes want you to know it is achingly cool. Look at that bright, bold highlight; the underlapping underlines in the top-right; the big splashes of primary colour. It looks like it would aspire to be Topolsky-era Bloomberg.com. And, let’s be honest, it is pretty nice, although all that bright blue’s tough on the eyeballs (colours vary by note theme). Details: The typeface of choice here is Christian Robertson’s Roboto, a Google Fonts staple that takes on geometric forms without turning them into a straitjacket. It’s nice, although the mixing of its Light and Bold variations creates a possibly unnecessary amount of contrast in the body text. One for the type nerds (we’re assuming if you’ve got this far you’re at least tolerant) — an interesting quirk here is that the TS Lombard logo and the “Economics / Politics / Markets” bit are both in Helvetica (ooh err, look at that tight spacing), but the date is seemingly in Akzidenz Grotesk, a workhorse from the 1890s. This is not a thing that matters. In three words: OMG so cool 😭  2. Standard Chartered  First impressions: Here’s a better version of a lot of what we’ve seen elsewhere. Maybe not so much needs to be in blue, but the hierarchies are sensible, there’s a good amount of content without crowding and charts are presented in-line, so no need for extra printing/scrolling. We’re also big fans of these little tl;dr summary bits alongside some latter pars:  Details: . . . Arial, again?! Look, it’s fine, we get why it’s there, we’re not mad, honest. In three words: Solid, considered, practical.  1. Peel Hunt  First impressions:   Details: What is there to say? First up, “Hello, Georgia!” — another works-anywhere kind of typeface — which provides body copy complements to Archivo elsewhere. Spacing’s maybe a little tight, hierarchies so-so. But the lilac and the teal — perfection. The deep purple headline, the random photo of an office — genius. We’d argue that given the cost of printer ink, printing something with this many shaded boxes is financially reckless, but what an object it would be to hold. In three words: [a picture is worth three words] ","13.02.2023"
"Finance staff ignoring mandatory office attendance demands, report suggests","Study finds workers and managers favour ‘remote-first’ approach despite C-suite diktats","Workers in financial services are often ignoring company rules on the number of days they should be in the office, according to a report sponsored by some of the UK’s largest financial institutions. The study by non-profit group Women in Banking and Finance (WIBF) and the London School of Economics found staff wanted more flexible working as they rejected presenteeism in favour of productivity. Finance workers saw flexibility rather than the need to meet a quota on days in the office as better aligned with efficiency at team level, according to the interview-based report.  The pandemic has caused many companies to consider new ways of working, with many moving to more flexible approaches but with a set number of days when workers are expected to be present in the office. The report said a move to “remote-first” working, in which homeworking is the primary option for most staff, had either no impact or a positive impact on productivity. It added that this “highlights that while at the C-suite level executives in many large firms are asking for workers to come into the office a specific number of days per week, in practice they are being ignored, with managers often favouring a remote-first approach that satisfies local operational needs”. The study, based on interviews with 70 women and 30 men in the City of London and carried out by LSE, covered businesses in banking, asset management, professional services, fintech and insurance. The researchers interviewed workers of various levels of seniority at companies such as Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, NatWest, Schroders and UBS. Grace Lordan, director of the Inclusion Initiative at LSE and an author of the report, said workers were growing frustrated with being told to go to the office to simply sit on a Zoom call. FT survey: How do we build back better for women in the workplace?We want to hear about your experiences - good and bad - at work both during the pandemic and now, and what you think employers should be doing to build back better for women in the workplace. Tell us via a short survey. “Firms that demand their employees are in the office for no reason will lose out on diverse talent pools,” she said. “These demands are also ego-driven rather than having the best interests of the business in mind.”  The study found that women especially favoured a more flexible approach and flagged concerns that overly prescriptive approaches to working in the office would deter female staff. Anna Lane, president of WIBF, said: “I expect that those managers who are demanding their workers fulfil a rigid three, four or five-day schedule will lose women to their competitors who do not.” The report was carried out with WIBF’s Accelerating Change Together research programme, which is seeking to better support and retain women in financial services. The programme is sponsored by Aegon, Baillie Gifford, Barclays, BlackRock, Citi, The Cumberland, EY, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, LSEG, Moody's, Morgan Stanley, Santander, TD and Schroders.","28.11.2022"
"What does Xi Jinping’s tighter regulatory grip on China mean for business?","Beijing has streamlined financial supervision and intensified research as tensions with US rise","With sweeping changes to financial and tech regulation, Chinese president Xi Jinping is preparing to shore up financial stability at home while trying to keep up in an intense rivalry with the US over technology. The changes, revealed this week at the annual gathering of the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, are big overhauls of the State Council, China’s cabinet, and government ministries. Underlying the moves is a desire by Xi and the party’s leadership to exercise tighter control over the levers of the state, according to analysts, as the Chinese president embarks on an unprecedented third five-year term. What changes are being made to financial sector supervision? One of the most significant changes is the replacement of China’s banking watchdog, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, with a new agency to oversee the financial sector.  The securities market will be handled as before by the markets supervisor, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, but everything else will fall under the remit of a new national financial regulatory administration.  The body will also take over some of the supervisory functions of the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, including oversight of state-owned conglomerates such as Citic Group and fintech companies such as Alibaba’s Ant Group. It will also take on some consumer protection work from the CSRC. The CSRC’s mandate will be widened to include the review of corporate bond issuance, giving it more say over the market in bonds issued by local governments, an area that has attracted increased scrutiny given their high indebtedness. The changes were a step towards a more international “twin peaks” model of financial regulation, with one agency covering market conduct and consumer protection and the other focused on financial system stability and policy, analysts said. Why now and what will be the economic impact of the changes? While financial regulation was once managed out of a single department in the PBoC, as the economy has grown, so has the regulatory system. Many of the numerous agencies at the national and local level have failed to keep up with new types of businesses and emerging risks, whether from consumer payment apps or peer-to-peer lending.  “The main aim is to unify the regulatory framework because in the past, a lot of non-banking financial industries had developed very fast,” said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD.com.  A beefed-up central regulatory agency is also likely to play a bigger role in supervising local financial activities. “In the past, there was a lack of supervision,” said Zheng Zhigang, finance professor at the Renmin University of China. He pointed to a scandal that sparked local bank runs last year as an example of the need for tighter regulation. “Establishing the new institution clarifies the responsibility of the financial supervision system.” This should also free up the central bank to focus on monetary policymaking and macroprudential supervision. Zhang Ning, an economist at UBS, suggested that “the government is trying to differentiate between so-called macroprudential regulation versus micro-regulations” as part of the changes. “The government’s focus is to improve efficiency and reduce big financial risks.” However, Fraser Howie, an independent expert on China’s financial sector, said the government could have expanded the powers of the existing CBIRC rather than make wholesale changes at a time when Xi was also planning to reshuffle the government’s entire economic team.  “It seems to be a solution to a problem they don’t have,” Howie said, adding that “you’re changing the structure at the same time as you’re changing all the people”. Why is China overhauling tech regulation and how will it reshape Chinese research? Tech companies have been hit hard by Washington’s imposition of export controls barring US companies from selling advanced chipmaking equipment to Chinese groups.  In this context, Beijing has charged a new Communist party science commission, answering to Xi, with the responsibility to catch up with the west in innovation and science. This will work alongside a reinvigorated Ministry of Science and Technology. “Facing tough science and tech competition globally and external containment efforts, we must straighten out leadership and management of science and technology,” said Xiao Jie, a high-ranking State Council official, when introducing the reforms on Tuesday. The restructuring would centralise party control over the country’s tech development efforts and create “a new type of whole-country system” for achieving breakthroughs, he said. The Ministry of Science and Technology will aim to build national labs, oversee projects, facilitate technology transfer and foster tech workers, the State Council said.  “China is concerned about its technological future under the tightening chip blockade from the US and its allies,” said Graham Webster, a China expert at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center. “For years we’ve seen a bureaucratic emphasis on the online world, but that is built on chips,” he said. “There is now a bureaucratic rebalancing to boosting fundamental science and deep industrial capabilities.” China will also create a national data administration to utilise the country’s vast troves of information, craft a national big data plan and lead the digitalisation of the economy and state. The bureau will be housed within the country’s state planning agency and take on some functions related to harnessing data from China’s powerful internet regulator, which will remain the watchdog overseeing big tech groups. Will there be more reforms?  With the parliamentary meeting running until next week, more changes could come. Analysts will be watching for the announcement of any parallel Communist party bodies to supervise the financial sector and other areas. These will give Xi even more direct control over government bodies, according to analysts. The institutional reforms are “part of broader efforts to enhance the party’s leadership over the nation’s socialist modernisation”, the party’s leadership said last week. Also crucial will be the people put in charge of the various agencies, with the National People’s Congress expected to vote on the appointments this weekend. The top candidates to lead the new financial regulatory body include Yi Huiman, the well-respected current head of the CSRC, people familiar with the matter said.

"Wheat prices: Black Sea export threat is just one constraint among many","Sensitivity of agricultural commodities prices to multiple granular factors is hardly news to traders ","Russia has withdrawn from a deal allowing Ukrainian grain exports from Black Sea ports. No one should panic. The Chicago wheat futures benchmark rose 7 per cent to almost $9 a bushel. That is relatively high. But the figure is still well below the peak that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.  The picture mirrors the hydrocarbons market. After eight months of war, supply uncertainties have come into sharper, narrower focus, reducing volatility. Wheat is plentiful, thanks to a good harvest. Getting it to where it is needed remains a problem.  Ukraine and Russia previously accounted for almost a third of global wheat exports. Ukraine may export just 6mn tonnes this year if it is lucky, one-third of what is typical, according to UBS estimates. Russia is also failing to get much of its crop to market. Many shippers are unwilling or unable to send vessels into harm’s way. Even so, a bumper global harvest pushed net speculative short positioning on US wheat futures to a two-year high last week, notes Saxo Bank.  That looks odd given supply concerns. Russia should export about 42mn tonnes of this year’s harvest. It has only managed to ship about 12mn tonnes so far, slightly below last year. Countries in Africa and the Middle East are reliant on these exports and are now paying steep premiums.  Weather is likely to return as a factor with the start of harvests in the southern hemisphere. This is subject to a third consecutive period of disruptive La Niña weather conditions. Rain is already causing flooding in Australia. A drought in Argentina means the harvest could be a quarter below normal. US water shortages suggest winter wheat for harvest next year will suffer too. Russian and Ukrainian farmers may meanwhile plant less wheat next year if the war continues, impeding lucrative exports.  The sensitivity of agricultural commodities prices to multiple granular factors is hardly news to traders and food manufacturers, however. The Ukraine war has simply become one of these factors. Reflecting this, prices are only slightly higher than their prewar peak of $8.4 a bushel.

"Why homebuilders have rallied","Plus the dollar and the debt ceiling","This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. We get April’s consumer price index report today. As ever, the reaction will be as interesting as the data itself. We hear a lot more chatter about recession than inflation these days. If the report comes in a little hot, will that change, or will the market shrug it off as a temporary aberration from inflation’s inevitable march downwards? Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com. Homebuilders, or, why we feel very dumb now Back in January, we wrote about our picks for the 2023 FT stock picking contest. One of them was a short position on PulteGroup, a homebuilder. We wrote: [Pulte’s] stock fell along with its peers as Fed tightening drove mortgage rates up. But since September, the group has come roaring back. Pulte is back near its all-time peaks, and with demand still high and input costs normalising, its margins are as wide as they have ever been. We asked Rick Palacios of John Burns Real Estate Consulting what has driven the homebuilder rally. He puts it down to low valuations (Pulte is at a mouth-watering six times forward earnings), lower costs, expectations of cooling inflation, hopes for lower mortgage rates and good balance sheets. We think that rates are going to fall slower than the market expects, even as demand declines, that margins must normalise, and that home prices have more room to fall. That low p/e ratio may prove deceptive as the “e” declines.  So, how’s that bet going? It’s going abysmally, thanks for asking:  Not only have we managed to pick an industry to short that is wildly outperforming the S&P; we’ve managed to pick the one stock that is wildly outperforming that industry.   Obviously we were wildly wrong, but what about, exactly? We were betting on a margin-crushing recession that has not arrived; mortgage rates have fallen a bit from their peaks, too, which has helped the homebuilders. But what we really misunderstood was how the very fast increase in mortgage rates would affect the industry, and in particular the relationship between the markets for new and existing homes.  Homeowners — including, ironically, the homeowner who is writing this — have responded to the spike in rates by swearing they will never, ever give up their current homes, which are attached to low-rate mortgages that now look unbelievably attractive. The result is that there are historically few existing homes for sale. So even though inventory of new homes is high, total home inventory is low, and new home prices and demand have hung in there.  Here, from Citigroup’s Anthony Pettinari, is a chart of total new homes for sale:   This puts homebuilders in an excellent position relative to their key competitor — existing homes. As Palacios, of John Burns, put it to me yesterday, “It’s as if there is a game being played and one team decided not to come.” Here is his chart explaining why homebuilders are, inevitably, taking share:  The public homebuilders are also taking share from smaller, privately held builders, as Citi’s Pettinari points out: Pandemic-related supply chain tightness has led to extended cycle times, and large public builders have more resources (procurement scale, access to contractor pools) to manage through these challenges relative to smaller peers and private builders. As a result, the top three public builders . . . have seen their share of new home sales rise sharply post-pandemic (to 30 per cent of new home sales, vs 25 per cent pre-pandemic and 14 per cent post [great financial crisis]). Further, the aftermath of SVB’s collapse and persistent pressure on regional banks may tighten smaller builders’ access to capital This trend could have a long way to run, given that private builders control three-quarters of the market.  The large public homebuilders have another key advantage: they have internal mortgage units, which can offer buyers a discounted rate. Providing a below-market mortgage has an economic cost, but it has two advantages over cutting the price of the house: more buyers can qualify for a cheaper mortgage, and by avoiding a cut to the headline price of the house, it doesn’t give the next buyer any ideas. This is the public homebuilders’ competitive “bazooka”, Palacios says. This is especially true because adjustable-rate mortgages, historically a key tool for selling to rate-sensitive buyers, are less widely available today.  Why has Pulte, in particular, done so well? John Lovallo of UBS argued to me that sentiment had been against the stock last year because its industry-leading margins and relatively upmarket pricing made it particularly vulnerable to a downturn. But margins have held, and the stock has bounced hard. He also noted that the stock still looks cheap at eight times earnings.  Is there any hope that our miserably bombed-out Pulte short call could make a comeback before year-end? Our best hope is that the homebuilder stocks are now pricing in Federal Reserve rate cuts in the near future, and that does not happen. And, of course, an outright recession would be bad for home sales. Michael Hartnett’s strategy team at Bank of America has been singling out homebuilders as one of the sectors pricing in a “goldilocks” soft-landing economic scenario that is unlikely to happen. We tend to agree, but there is an awful lot of ground to make up. USD and US default If the debt-ceiling negotiations break down and the US falls into technical default, will the dollar strengthen or weaken? One can make the case for either outcome; markets aren’t pricing in much yet. On strength’s side, investors tend to flee towards dollar assets in times of stress, even (perhaps especially) when the stress comes from US. On the other hand, the US falling through on its debts, and denting the dollar’s prestige, is surely the exception. The last time the US toyed with default, in 2011, offers some reason to expect strength. Technical default was never reached, but jitters near the “X-date” (when the US exhausts its cash) did generate a small dollar rally, mostly against EM currencies, while pushing up dollar funding costs. The Bank of America chart below shows dollar performance against EM currencies (light blue) and DM currencies (dark blue) around the 2011 X-date:  There is another factor to consider. Global investors and companies have huge dollar-denominated liabilities, and so have little choice but to buy dollars into a default. As Karl Schamotta of Corpay told us: This is really key to the dedollarisation debate: the debt side of the equation is more important than the investment side. The fact that the global economy is typically running a giant carry trade using the dollar as a funding currency means that in events like this . . . people are going to sell other currencies and buy the dollar. They’re going to unwind those [dollar] borrowing possessions, cover their exposures and attempt to hedge themselves.What you would expect to see [in a technical default] is the dollar rise By “giant carry trade”, Schamotta means that market participants tend to borrow in dollars to invest in other currencies. When the US financial system trembles, and access to short-term dollar loans starts looking unsure, nabbing any dollars you can find is rational, so that you won’t default on your own debts.   Adarsh Sinha, Bank of America FX analyst, disagrees. In a note yesterday, he argues high interest rates make this time different than in 2011. He explains:  High US yields mean the USD is less likely to be used as a funding currency for carry trades; as a consequence higher market volatility (leading to carry trade unwinds) should be less supportive for USD. Moreover, peak Fed policy means the balance of risks shifts towards lower US rates; US-specific macro risks can lead to pricing of Fed rate cuts offsetting the impact of risk-off on the USD . . . For FX, the implications for the USD are not clear. Gridlock, possibility of technical default and pricing of Fed rate cuts should be negative but risk-off sentiment may dominate these factors Steve Englander, G10 FX head at Standard Chartered, pushed back on Sinha’s view, saying it “falls into the category of ‘maybe, but probably not the main line of the story’”. The main line, Englander thinks, is less about yield-seeking carry trades than the fact that “so many balance sheets, so many financial transactions have an unpleasant dollar leg that can be compromised”. Like Schamotta, he expects a technical default would cause a dollar jump. Columbia Threadneedle’s Ed Al-Hussainy, friend of Unhedged, offers a warning: “No asset class has lost investors more money over every meaningful investment horizon than speculating on the value on the US dollar”. He points out that forecasting dollar movements in calm times, including with commonplace frameworks like the dollar smile, already borders on impossible. The debt ceiling and the dollar make for a good intellectual exercise and a bad trade. (Ethan Wu) One good read Aswath Damodaran likes Citi stock.

If there’s one unavoidable topic for fund managers and Wall Street executives, it’s the brewing troubles in the $5.6tn US commercial real estate (CRE) industry, DD’s Ortenca Aliaj, Antoine Gara and Eric Platt report. CRE is at the centre of the storm with rising interest rates, falling property valuations and waning demand for office space expected to wreak havoc on the sector. In a Federal Reserve survey released on Monday, a majority of US banks said they tightened credit standards for loans secured by non-residential properties in the first quarter, while none loosened standards. That could end up being a big problem for CRE because regional banks contribute a significant chunk of the lending to property owners, as much as two-thirds by some measures. With more than a trillion dollars of CRE debt due before the end of 2025, property owners may start to find it difficult to borrow more cash, and even if they can, they face significantly higher borrowing costs. “The private market hasn’t started to heavily mark down real estate,” said Apollo Global Management co-president Scott Kleinman. “The equity will be first. That’s the next shoe to drop in the US.” Berkshire Hathaway vice-chair Charlie Munger has warned of trouble ahead in the US commercial property market, with banks ‘full of’ what he said were ‘bad loans’ as property prices fall © Bloomberg Kleinman isn’t alone. Berkshire Hathaway vice-chair Charlie Munger warned of a brewing storm in the US commercial property market, saying banks were “full” of “bad loans”.  But some corners of Wall Street think the risks are being overstated. Brian Kingston, chief executive of Brookfield’s real estate business, one of the largest players in the sector, pointed out that there are issues with traditional office properties. Newer buildings and other assets, such as multi-family and high-end retail have held up well. “Making broad generalisations about commercial real estate can be dangerous,” he said. The reality is that it’s difficult to know exactly what shape the commercial property market is in. As Barclays recently pointed out in a report, only a small portion of CRE is securitised so it’s difficult to get accurate data on how it is performing. Still, what no one wants to do is underestimate just how bad things could get. As the chief executive of a major US bank pointed out: “Commercial real estate is leverage on leverage on leverage . . . if people are forced to quickly unwind that leverage it can pop up in other places.” The rusty springs beneath a $4bn mattress deal Mattress M&A is usually fodder for lame bedding-based puns, and Tempur Sealy’s $4bn deal to buy Mattress Firm announced on Tuesday is no different. America’s biggest bed manufacturer and a major retailer are getting under the covers — groan. But beneath the bouncy idioms, this particular deal has a rather dark history, the FT’s Joseph Cotterill writes in a DD dispatch from South Africa.  That’s because the transaction’s major seller, with a 45 per cent economic interest in Mattress Firm, is Steinhoff, the Frankfurt and Johannesburg-listed retailer. Steinhoff’s own $3.8bn acquisition in 2016 was a major milestone on the way to its collapse in South Africa’s largest ever corporate fraud just over a year later. The entry into America was part of a dealmaking spree for furnishing world domination by Steinhoff’s former chief executive Markus Jooste, who also bought the UK’s Poundland among other international assets. But it soon blew up. Mattress Firm sales foundered (it also had a dispute with a key supplier — one Tempur Sealy). Years later, Jooste told a South African regulator the deal was a “disaster”. By then of course, Steinhoff itself was a disaster, after the discovery of accounting irregularities all but wiped out its shares. Jooste, who denies wrongdoing, faces probes in Germany and South Africa. Steinhoff embarked on a years-long attempt to salvage the company, which has €10bn in debt. Mattress Firm itself spent a period in bankruptcy protection in 2018 and closed hundreds of stores. It pulled plans to list earlier this year. These days, after a series of asset sales, shareholder lawsuits and arcane creditor negotiations, Steinhoff is in hot water.  The company recently overhauled a plan to avoid liquidation after a shareholder revolt over terms that would have left them without equity after a delisting. They would now have rights to a fifth of the rebuilt company if the plan is approved this month. Steinhoff will at least be able to use the $1.2bn cash it will receive from Tempur Sealy to pay some of the debt (it will also own 7.5 per cent of the merged group). Still . . . talk about M&A monsters under the bed. Private equity’s price predicament DD has written before about the clubby ranks of private equity and its lucrative tendency to sell to itself. The practice provides a ready source of deal flow for cash-rich buyout houses, as well as an easy exit route for firms looking to monetise their investments. Over the past few weeks, though, a handful of closely watched deals between private equity firms in Europe have stalled as buyers and sellers have struggled to agree on price, DD’s Will Louch and Ivan Levingston report. Advent’s planned multibillion-euro sale of biometrics technology company IDEMIA failed to win an attractive bid from potential suitors. BC Partners’ VetPartners attracted bids and secured financing but is still deliberating whether it could sell the veterinary clinic chain for a higher price when the economic outlook brightens, according to people familiar with the matter.  The reason why these deals aren’t getting done is simple, said Bank of America’s global financial sponsors co-head Saba Nazar. “The LBO math doesn’t work — valuations remain inflated and the cost of borrowing has gone up.” Taking companies public — another favoured exit route for private equity — is also tricky. Initial public offerings in Europe had their second-worst quarter since the Covid-19 pandemic, PitchBook data shows. The inability to realise gains is prompting firms to get creative to return money to their backers. One tactic being used involves so-called continuation funds, which can help investors cash out without having to sell or list an asset. Private equity’s game of pass-the-parcel has become so prevalent that Amundi’s Vincent Mortier likened it to a Ponzi scheme last year, forecasting a future reckoning. If the dealmaking environment doesn’t improve, that day could come sooner than expected.

For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog  Good evening. Geopolitical tensions and increasing protectionism are reshaping global investment, threatening to depress growth and lead to more financial instability, according to a flurry of reports ahead of the spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF.  The IMF said that the rise of “friendshoring” — foreign direct investment flowing more between countries that are political allies than those that are geographically close  — was likely to increase the risk of economic downturns and could cut long-term global output by 2 per cent.  “The estimated large and widespread long-term output losses show why it’s crucial to foster global integration — especially as major economies endorse inward-looking policies,” the reports’ authors said. The message comes as governments increasingly take to protectionist rhetoric, from US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen’s call for prioritising supply chains “with countries we can count on” to Washington’s export restrictions on Chinese semiconductor technology. Emerging economies that are more dependent on inward investment by foreign companies were most likely to feel the impact, the IMF said. In a separate report, the World Trade Organization warned that rising interest rates and financial instability would add to the problems of protectionism and hit growth in exports.  Export volumes increased by a lower than expected 2.7 per cent in 2022 compared with 2021 as the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia disrupted supply chains already fragile from the pandemic, the WTO said. It forecasts that growth in exports will slow this year to 1.7 per cent, well below the past decade’s average expansion of 2.6 per cent. The report also highlighted global food insecurity stemming from the war, with famine still a possibility.  Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf in his latest column explores the ramifications of this shift in trading relationships, and especially the decoupling of the US and China, which he characterises as a “significant turning point, with unpredictable and, in all probability, damaging outcomes”.   It follows a World Bank warning earlier this week that technology decoupling and trade restrictions were hurting knowledge generation and innovation in both superpowers, posing a long-term threat to growth across Asia. What then should the rest of the world do? One answer, Wolf suggests, is to create a free trade agreement on WTO principles — but then going beyond them, building on the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). “Add in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. But also leave the superpowers outside. The rest of the world can still co-operate,” he concludes.

"Credit Suisse bondholders sue","Stability after SVB’s collapse comes at a price for US regional banks  ","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Credit Suisse bondholders sue’ Sonja HutsonGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, April 21st. And this is your FT News Briefing.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Credit Suisse bondholders are suing the Swiss banking regulator. US regional banks have stabilised after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, but the news isn’t all good. Plus, we look at the impact that the US court battle over an abortion pill could have on the future of the drug industry. I’m Sonja Hutson, in for Marc Filipino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Former Credit Suisse bondholders are suing Switzerland’s banking regulator, Finma. The bondholders are upset over the recent sale of the bank to rival UBS. That sale wiped out the value of $17bn worth of convertible bonds. But investors who owned equity in the bank were able to hold on to some of their stocks’ value. Here’s the FT’s Austria and Switzerland correspondent Sam Jones.  Sam JonesNow, in any, any kind of standardised debt waterfall, any kind of bankruptcy process the world over, everyone knows that equity holders are subordinate to debt holders. So the question is why was it proportionate that equity holders in this situation should be given some value but debt holders not? And that issue of proportionality specifically highlighted in the Swiss constitution. So the case says that Finma as an organ of the Swiss state is obliged to follow these constitutional principles.  Sonja HutsonSo, Sam, what are the broader implications of this case? How significant is it?  Sam Jones I mean, it’s hugely significant, really, because this is Switzerland, you know, and Switzerland is thought of as being a place where, really as a bond holder, you’d never have to worry about your assets being expropriated in some kind of extraordinary situation. Now, what bondholders are trying to do is claim that this is exactly that. This is an expropriated act by the Swiss government and that they deserve compensation as a result. Whether some of those claims are true or not, who knows? And obviously the Swiss government has a very particular view on that, that it disputes strongly that this was an emergency situation to save a bank that could have had catastrophic consequences if it had not been dealt with. But this case is really going to be a thorn in the side of Switzerland and the Swiss government as they continue and try to claw back some of the reputational damage that has been done by Credit Suisse’s collapse.   Sonja HutsonThat’s the FT’s Sam Jones.  [MUSIC PLAYING] During last month’s banking turmoil, people rushed to take their money out of regional lenders. But now, first-quarter earnings reports out this week are showing that deposit flight wasn’t quite as bad as expected. The FT’s Stephen Gandel has been reporting on this, and he joins me now. Hi, Stephen.  Stephen Gandel Hi.  Sonja Hutson So why do you think there was less money leaving these regional banks than we initially thought?  Stephen GandelYou know, what everyone was watching was what was going on at Silicon Valley. And it appears they, you know, they were the extreme. They had a much different business model than most regional lenders tied very closely to the health of start-ups in Silicon Valley, which is part of the economy that’s been hurt the worst in the last year as interest rates have risen. And so I think what we didn’t realise is that many other regional lenders were more diversified than Silicon Valley. Now, that being said, I think worries continue for regional lenders in terms of profitability and whether they are sitting on some bad loans when it comes to lending to commercial real estate developers.   Sonja Hutson Steven, are the regional banks stable now? I mean, how are they doing overall?  Stephen Gandel It seems that they are stable. There’s ample evidence that’s come out from these first-quarter earnings reports that it doesn’t appear that many others are going to go the way of Silicon Valley Bank. But what the earnings reports do show is that the profit picture going forward for them, it’s worse than we thought before Silicon Valley. Their profits are shrinking much faster. At some of the banks we’ve seen profits fall 40, 50 per cent. And the reason is, is because for regional banks that long lived on their relationships — local customers, small businesses. They kept their money at these banks and didn’t expect much in return other than services and processing their transactions. Now, with this kind of added risk that they saw in Silicon Valley, depositors want to get paid something for keeping their money there. And what that means is that they have to pay higher interest rates. And if they have to pay up more from deposits, that means that’s less money that they make from the lending they do. And what we’re watching for is whether that shrinks to the point where some of these banks say, hey, you know, maybe we can’t, maybe it’s not worth it for us.  Sonja Hutson Stephen Gandel is the FT’s US banking correspondent. Thanks, Stephen.  Sam JonesThank you.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Sonja HutsonThe abortion pill mifepristone was given approval for use by the US Food and Drug Administration more than two decades ago. But recently, a federal judge in Texas overturned its regulatory approval, which in effect created a nationwide ban. That ban was put on hold temporarily. Now, the US Supreme Court is expected to rule today on whether to keep the drug available while the legal battle over it continues to play out. The FT’s Brooke Masters argues the battle may have a chilling effect on innovation in the US. She joins me now to talk more about this. Hi, Brooke.  Brooke Masters Hi.  Sonja HutsonSo how do you see this battle impacting pharmaceutical investment in the US?  Brooke Masters Well, it’s really interesting. The entire pharmaceutical industry is up in arms over this because what’s happened is that the judge who said stop selling mifepristone basically did something that hasn’t been done in a century and substituted his own judgment for the FDA’s expert opinion on what’s safe. And the drug industry says if a judge can do that to the abortion pill, they can do it to anything. And so how are we supposed to invest and develop cutting-edge drugs with the knowledge that some day some judge who will say is an anti-vaxxer doesn’t want me to produce it later?  Sonja Hutson What kind of global impact could this have?  Brooke Masters It’s huge for two reasons. The FDA has long been seen as the sort of gold standard of drug approval dating back really into the 60s. And therefore, if its authority is undermined, it makes the whole process of drug development more complicated, particularly for countries that really can’t afford to have their own really strong drug protection rules. They tend to rely on the FDA. And if the FDA is suddenly called into question, it has a real problem. Also, you know, half of all the big companies that spend the most R&D money on drug development are American companies. So they can’t develop at home. They’re going to have to go abroad. And that’s really bad.  Sonja Hutson Brooke Masters is the FT’s US financial editor. Thanks, Brooke.  Brooke MastersThanks for having me.

"Greenhill and Lazard: investment banking pioneers at a crossroads","Plus, Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling’s transatlantic pact and western banks’ China struggles","One thing to start: The new owner of Silicon Valley Bank is suing HSBC and several former employees for more than $1bn, claiming the group “engineered a scheme to plunder” SVB of top bankers and confidential information. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter Greenhill and Lazard at a turning pointTransatlantic legal rivals team up to surviveWestern banks’ China bets backfire New beginnings for Lazard and Greenhill  On October 15 2009, shares of boutique investment bank Greenhill & Co traded at $95 — more than five times the price they fetched in the 2004 initial public offering that made its investment bankers the envy of Wall Street.  What wasn’t known at the time was that those trading levels would represent Greenhill’s high-water mark as a public stock.  October 15 2009 also happened to be the day after Bruce Wasserstein, the legendary banker and longtime contemporary of Robert Greenhill, died.  Until his untimely death, Wasserstein had been chief executive of Lazard, the firm he’d been tasked with turning around since quitting Allianz’s Dresdner Bank to take the helm in 2002. Wasserstein would eventually be succeeded by the longtime Lazard hand Ken Jacobs. And by coincidence or not, Greenhill and Lazard in the past week have reached respective crossroads. On Monday, Greenhill announced that its 27-year run as an independent firm is nearing an end as it prepares to sell to Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group at a $550mn total enterprise valuation. Its shares on Friday, before the more than 100 per cent premium to be paid by Mizuho, had fallen to under $7.   The news at Lazard was less dramatic. Last week, the Financial Times and others reported that Jacobs would soon cede the chief executive perch to Peter Orszag, the firm’s current head of financial advisory who had long been tapped as its future leader.   The pending switch to Orszag, the prominent economist who joined Lazard in 2016, comes as the company said it planned to slash a tenth of its workforce amid a deal slump and a sharp recent increase in managing directors. Its stock price is now under $30, down from $43 in October of 2009. M&A is a cyclical and volatile business, but both Greenhill and Lazard undoubtedly became victims of their own success. Upstart firms, including Centerview Partners, Evercore, Moelis and PJT Partners, have seized on their market share in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large companies were increasingly comfortable hiring boutique banks for lucrative assignments. Greenhill has made the choice to accept a premium offer and take its chances within Mizuho’s larger financial umbrella just ahead of its 30th birthday.  Lazard, approaching its third century in business, will once again in its complex history try to figure things out on its own since its last turnround effort in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Fourteen years is several lifetimes on Wall Street, after all. The $3.4bn legal merger hoping to bridge the Atlantic At the turn of the century, Clifford Chance set out to be first among the UK’s “magic circle” to make its name on Wall Street by taking over New York’s Rogers & Wells.  What transpired instead was a cautionary tale on transatlantic legal M&A: there were culture clashes, pay battles and big-name departures. Allen & Overy thinks it can do one better. On Sunday, partners at the London-based firm and former US heavyweight Shearman & Sterling were given just hours’ notice to join calls to learn that their top ranks had been quietly brokering a $3.4bn megamerger, the FT’s Kate Beioley and Joe Miller report. The deal, if approved by both firms’ partners, would create the world’s fourth-largest legal firm by revenue and bring about some much-needed scale for both parties. After abandoning a merger with Los Angeles firm O’Melveny & Myers in 2019 following a failure to agree a valuation, A&O has struck out on its own in the US in recent years. But those endeavours have been hampered by deeper-pocketed US firms that have poached many of its top US-based lawyers while also muscling in on its home territory in the UK.  Fresh off collapsed merger talks with rival Hogan Lovells, meanwhile, Shearman has ticked off many of its top partners amid an expensive restructuring. The firm has attempted to scale up in more profitable areas like private equity. But some of those efforts have stoked internal tensions, said former partners, as generous payouts to new hires have left existing equity partners with a diminished bonus pool. “Everyone in the world has interviewed every Shearman partner by now,” as the managing partner of a rival New York firm told the FT last month. Shearman had shown signs of a resurgence in recent months, working on deals including Chevron’s $6.3bn acquisition of PDC Energy, Mubadala Capital’s purchase of a stake in Fortress Investment Group from SoftBank, CVS Health’s $10.6bn purchase of Oak Street Health, and the $12.5bn sale of SAP’s Qualtrics to investors including Silver Lake. Leaders at Shearman hope that combining with larger A&O will further reverse its fortunes.  Law firm integration can be a messy process, though. Top talent will no doubt be tempted by generous bidders to jump ship before the storm. One day after news of the merger broke, The Lawyer reported that A&O’s chief financial officer Donald Joyce, is leaving the firm. He’ll be replaced by US chief operating officer Bethan Chatters. People who have worked at both said they believed Shearman had a more “cut-throat” environment than A&O, while other people close to both firms said they already knew each other and meshed well. Potential culture clashes notwithstanding, the merger could be a necessary survival mechanism as the dealmaking slump pushes consolidation in the advisory space into high gear. Proponents of the merger are hoping that “survival of the fittest” mentality will be enough to sway each firm’s partners as they vote on the deal. As Lex notes, EY’s foiled plan to split the firm provided a thought-provoking case study on the pitfalls of collective decision-making. Western banks stumble in China Many of the biggest names on Wall Street and in Europe have spent years pouring money and resources into investment banking operations in mainland China. They’re barely a rounding error in the context of the banks’ global business, and are often lossmaking.  In 2021, a record year for investment banking globally, the bet seemed to be paying off: six out of seven global investment banks with operations in mainland China profited from those units. Now, that shift is going into reverse just as relations between the US and China hit a low ebb, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Cheng Leng and Tom Hale report. Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank reported losses in their China-based units in 2022 and Morgan Stanley’s profits fell. Only UBS and JPMorgan Chase — whose chief Jamie Dimon is due to visit Shanghai and Hong Kong next week — saw profits rise. Many of the banks have justified their lossmaking mainland presence by saying it allows them to build relationships with Chinese companies, which could lead to public listings or cross-border deals, the profits of which would often be booked elsewhere. But even that’s looking harder than ever as banks shun potentially lucrative work for political reasons. “AI is the next big thing and five years ago, we would’ve spent a lot of time covering Chinese AI companies,” said a top executive at a western investment bank in Hong Kong. “But now, no. They might end up on an entity list in the US.”  Job moves Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman plans to step down within the next year.

"Apple’s business under growing threat from China’s coronavirus wave","Supply chain experts warn outbreak following reversal of zero-Covid curbs creates uncertainty for iPhone maker","Apple’s business is under threat from a widespread coronavirus outbreak in China, with supply chain experts warning of a growing risk of months-long disruption to the production of iPhones. The US tech giant has had to contend with more than a month of chaos at its main assembler Foxconn’s megafactory in Zhengzhou, China, known as “iPhone City”, following an outbreak that started in October. Foxconn has moved some of its production to other factories across China, while Apple has worked with components suppliers to alleviate unusually long wait times — about 23 days for customers buying high-end iPhones in the US, according to research by Swiss bank UBS.   As the Chinese government reverses its zero-Covid policy, a longer-lasting risk now looms: the potential of worker shortages at component plants or assembly factories across the country. “We should be seeing a lot of operations get impacted by absenteeism, not just at factories, but warehouse, distribution, logistic and transportation facilities as well,” said Bindiya Vakil, chief executive of Resilinc, a California-based group that tracks more than 3mn components to provide supply chain mapping services. Apple warned on November 6 of “significant” disruption ahead of the holiday season. The rare statement came less than two weeks after executives forecast subdued sales growth in the crucial period around Christmas, of below 8 per cent. The consensus among analysts is that company revenues this quarter will fall just below the record $123.9bn it achieved over the same period last year, with net profits projected to tumble more than 8 per cent, according to bank estimates pooled by Visible Alpha. That would break a 14-quarter revenue growth streak as Apple experiences a shortage of between 5mn and 15mn iPhones. Many analysts had initially raised forecasts for the following six months, assuming that unfulfilled orders would be postponed rather than cancelled.  But the risks to Apple’s revenues for 2023 have increased as modelling has shown 1mn Chinese people are at risk of dying from Covid during the coming winter months after president Xi Jinping removed strict pandemic controls. One Apple store in Beijing’s main shopping district had to cut hours last week because all its workers were sick.  A fifth of Apple’s revenue comes from sales in China, while more than 90 per cent of iPhones are assembled there. Smartphone rival Samsung exited China in 2019 and has diversified assembly in at least four countries. Horace Dediu, independent analyst at Asymco, a consultancy, said Apple’s production and operational woes in recent months could be followed by a demand crisis in China as consumers reprioritise spending habits. “Though the rest of the world saw demand rise during lockdowns, it was due to work from home and stimulus,” Dediu said. “With low immunity and minimal safety nets, Chinese consumers could hunker down and avoid big purchases next year.” Apple’s most important Taiwanese suppliers including Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron have responded by seeking to expand their nascent Indian operations. Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence group at CyberMedia Research in Gurgaon, India, estimated that upwards of 7-8 per cent of iPhones are being assembled in India, and predicted the big three Taiwanese suppliers were targeting 18 per cent of iPhone assembly to be in India by 2024. China’s attempt to stamp out the disease rather than manage it has left the country’s assembly lines exposed, said Alan Day, chair of State of Flux, a London-based supply chain consultancy that has been working with the UN on corporate standards for responding to Covid outbreaks.  “The next two to six months really will be a defining moment for Apple’s supply chain, because of China’s immaturity of handling Covid,” Day said. “The rest of the world has developed standards, but China has been almost non-existent in getting companies to embrace those standards.” Additional reporting by Ryan McMorrow in Beijing","25.12.2022"

For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog  Good evening. Oil prices jumped today after yesterday’s surprise announcement of a cut in production from Opec+ members that has threatened to reignite inflationary pressures as well as tensions between Saudi Arabia and the US.  The reduction of more than 1mn barrels a day, including 500,000 from Saudi Arabia — 5 per cent of its output —  was unusual for being announced outside a formal Opec+ meeting, suggesting an element of urgency among the cartel members. Russia said it would extend its existing 500,000 b/d cut until the end of the year. As our explainer details, the move is an attempt by Opec+ to prop up or push higher oil prices, which recently fell towards $70 a barrel as banking turmoil led to a sell-off of risky assets, down from the $100 levels of last year. The move could exacerbate strains between Saudi Arabia and the US, which last year pushed for the kingdom to pump more oil in an attempt to restrain surging energy costs. Washington will also be annoyed at the Saudis’ determination to keep working with Russia, which helped form the expanded Opec+ group in 2016. Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil major, has also just strengthened its ties with China through two refinery deals. The Opec+ announcement pushed up shares in other oil companies, which are benefiting from the rush to shore up supplies as energy security trumps climate concerns. Despite passing significant legislation to accelerate the development of green tech, President Joe Biden has recently given the green light to drilling in Alaska and boasted that oil output would soon hit record highs.  And in the UK, a new front in the war between environmental campaigners and fossil-fuel companies has opened up at Rosebank, a vast oilfield off the Shetland Islands, where a $4.5bn project owned by Norway’s Equinor aims to drill for up to 300mn barrels of oil and gas, more than double the size of the nearby Cambo field.  The likely approval by regulators was reflected in the enthusiasm of energy secretary Grant Shapps, who said last week: “Unless you can explain how we can transition (to net zero) without oil and gas, we need oil and gas.”  In the meantime, banks that had been forecasting higher crude prices are doubling down, with Goldman Sachs raising its year-end target from $90 a barrel to $95 a barrel. More expensive oil also complicates central bank attempts to restrain inflation, forcing them to keep lifting interest rates or keep them higher for longer.

"What I learnt from three banking crises","Gillian Tett has had a ringside view of a quarter-century of financial crashes. What can each teach us — and will technology change the game?","A few weeks ago, I went to dinner in Manhattan with friends who work in finance on America’s East and West coasts. Nothing odd about that, you might think. But this gathering was memorable: over wine, my companions traded tales about the tactics they and their colleagues had used the previous day to yank deposits from troubled banks such as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and First Republic.  Some had done this on their laptops or smartphones, sitting in taxis and meetings, or while attending the South by Southwest tech conference in Austin, Texas; others had dispatched emails to their assistants instead. Either way, as the tales piled up, I kept surreptitiously glancing at my own phone for updates on the panic. Physically we were in a sushi restaurant; but in cyberspace we had a ringside, real-time view of a modern-day bank run.  In some senses, it felt wearily familiar. I have watched two financial crises unfold before: once in 1997 and 1998 in Tokyo, as an FT correspondent, when Japanese banks imploded after the 1980s bubble; then in 2007 and 2008, when I was capital markets editor in London during the global financial crisis. I wrote books on both. We can track fevered debates via social media about troubled lenders. Bank runs have become imbued with a tinge of reality TV Those events taught me a truth about finance that we often ignore. Even if banking appears to be about complex numbers, it rests on the slippery and all-too-human concept of “credit”, in the sense of the Latin credere, meaning “to trust” — and nowhere more than in relation to the “fractional banking” concept that emerged in medieval and early Renaissance Italy and now shapes modern finance.   The fractional banking idea posits that banks need to retain only a small proportion of the deposits they collect from customers, since depositors will very rarely try to get all their money back at the same time. That works brilliantly well in normal conditions, recycling funds into growth-boosting loans and bonds. But should anything prompt depositors to grab their money en masse, fractional banking implodes. Which is what happened in 1997 and 2007 — and what I saw unfold in the sushi restaurant last month. However, in another respect, this latest panic was different — and more startling — than I have seen before, for reasons that matter for the future. The key issue is information. During the 1997-98 Japanese turmoil, I would meet government officials to swap notes, often over onigiri rice balls. But it was a fog: there was little hard information on the (then nascent) internet and the media community was in such an isolated bubble that the kisha (or press) club of Japanese journalists had different information from foreigners. To track the bank runs, I had to physically roam the pavements of Tokyo.  Anxious customers check their smartphones as they wait to enter a branch of Silicon Valley Bank © Xinhua News Agency/Eyevine A decade later, during the global financial crisis, there was more transparency: when banks such as Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers failed, scenes of panic were seen on TV screens. But fog also lingered: if I wanted to know the price of credit default swaps (or CDS, a financial product that shows, crucially, whether investors fear a bank is about to go bust), I had to call bankers for a quote; the individual numbers did not appear on the internet. No longer. Some aspects of March’s drama remain murky; there is no timely data on individual bank outflows, say. Yet CDS prices are now displayed online (which mattered enormously when Deutsche Bank wobbled). We can use YouTube on our phones, anywhere, to watch Jay Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, give a speech (which I recently did while driving through Colorado) or track fevered debates via social media about troubled lenders. Bank runs have become imbued with a tinge of reality TV.  A Sapporo resident scans a special edition of a newspaper in November 1997 for news of the financially troubled Hokkaido Takushoku Bank  © AFP/Getty Images This feels empowering for non-bankers. But it also fuels contagion risks. Take Silicon Valley Bank. One pivotal moment in its downfall occurred on Thursday 9 March when chief executive Greg Becker held a conference call with his biggest investors and depositors. “Greg told everyone we should not panic, because the bank will not fail if we all stick together,” one of SVB’s big depositors told me.  Similar conversations took place in Japan in 1997, physically, in smoke-filled rooms. But few customers knew. Not so in 2023: reports of Becker’s words leaked into the internet, fuelling a stampede. In a few hours, some $42bn — or a quarter of SVB’s funds — departed. Back in 1984, by way of comparison, it took depositors an entire week to withdraw half their funds from Continental Illinois — in person — when that giant lender failed.   The SVB managers asked the Federal Reserve for help in meeting depositors’ claims. But unlike mobile banking, the Fed facilities are open for only a few hours a day. By Friday morning “a total of $100bn was scheduled to go out the door”, Michael Barr, Fed vice-chair for supervision, later told Congress. The bank was dead. Or as Jane Fraser, chief executive of Citigroup, noted: “There were a couple of tweets and then [SVB] went down faster than we have seen before.”   A blue-jacketed trader sits to check his tablet on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in February 2007 © Polaris/Eyevine And the panic did not end there: as rumours snowballed, cyber-herds targeted groups that were seen as vulnerable, be that Signature Bank (which was perceived to have mismanaged interest rate risk and had big exposures to real estate), First Republic (which, like SVB, had a high proportion of rich customers whose accounts exceeded the official $250,000 bank insurance limit, making them a potential flight risk), or Credit Suisse (which was so scandal-tainted and poorly managed that depositors were already withdrawing their funds.)  Such contagion had erupted before in finance; think of the crowd panic in the streets of London during the South Sea Bubble of 1720. But as Powell ruefully observed: “The speed of the run [is] very different from what we’ve seen in the past.” Or to cite Fraser again: social media and mobile banking today are a “game-changer” for finance — as in many other areas of our lives.  So how should investors, regulators and bankers respond? One obvious answer would be to drag central banking processes into the 21st century, and keep them operating 24/7 in a crisis. Regulators could also bolster capital reserves, protect more deposits, or make it harder to withdraw money at such times. But ultimately, banks and investors will become more risk-aware — and risk-averse — only by doing what airline pilots do: prepare for future shocks by studying past accidents or near-disasters. And from my observations over three decades in Tokyo, London and New York, there are five key lessons to ponder.   1. No bank is an island The first lesson is that when a bank implodes, this is almost always a symptom — not a cause — of something askew in the wider financial world, affecting other institutions. Financiers rarely want to admit this. When Fraser of Citi recently appeared before the Economic Club of Washington DC, she insisted in a chirpy, no-nonsense manner that the problems at SVB and Credit Suisse were “idiosyncratic”.  Perhaps so. “Idiosyncratic sounds like idiotic — and Silicon Valley was that,” says Lawrence J White, a finance professor at New York University who formerly worked in government during the savings and loan crisis. Or as Powell observed: “At a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly [because] they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk.” In plain English, the core reason a panic erupted was that SVB’s balance sheet was stuffed with long-term Treasury bonds whose value has plunged in the last year as the Fed has raised rates, creating losses.  But SVB was not entirely alone. “Other banks have substantial unrecognised losses on investments and high levels of uninsured deposits,” says White. That stems from the most crucial problem: after 15 years of ultra-loose monetary policy, many financial institutions have strategies that are designed for a low-rate world, and are ill-prepared for higher rates.   I have seen this before. When banks such as Japan’s Long-Term Credit Bank failed in the late 1990s, critics wailed about idiosyncratic “scandals”, such as the fact that some LTCB managers stuffed embarrassing records of loan losses into manholes (yes, really).  But that was a symptom of a bigger problem: the Japanese banks were so flush with extra cash in the 1980s that they threw money into real estate deals that went wrong. Similarly, when Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, and politicians vilified its former head, Dick Fuld, this was part of a bigger pattern: a decade of financial engineering by banks had encouraged dangerous risk-taking. Cheap money always carries costs.   2. Don’t fight the last war The second lesson is that investors and regulators often miss these bigger structural flaws because they — like the proverbial generals — stay focused on the last war.  Take interest rate risks. These “flew under the supervisory system’s radar” in recent years, says Patrick Honohan, former central bank governor of Ireland; so much so that “the Fed’s recent bank stress tests used scenarios with little variation [and] none examined higher interest rates” — even amid a cycle of rising rates. Why? The events of 2008 left investors obsessively worried about credit risk, because of widespread mortgage defaults in that debacle. But interest rate risk was downplayed, probably because it had not caused problems since 1994. The global financial crisis was similar: when I asked bankers at entities such as UBS in late 2008 why they had missed mortgage default risks in earlier years, they told me that their risk managers were too busy worrying about hedge funds and corporate loans instead. That was because a big hedge fund (Long-Term Capital Management) imploded in 1998 and the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, creating corporate loan losses. The past is not always a good guide to future risks.  3. Safety is a state of mind A third, associated, lesson is that items considered “safe” can be particularly dangerous because they seem easy to ignore. In the late 1990s, Japanese bankers told me that they made property loans because this seemed “safer” than corporate loans, because house prices always went up. Similarly, bankers at UBS, Citi and Merrill Lynch told me in 2008 that one reason why the dangers around repackaged subprime mortgage loans were ignored was that these instruments had supposedly safe triple-A credit ratings — so risk managers paid scant attention.  So, too, with SVB: its Achilles heel was its portfolio of long-term Treasury bonds that are supposed to be the safest asset of all; so much so that regulators have encouraged (if not forced) banks to buy them. Or as Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan, noted in his annual shareholders’ letter, “ironically banks were incented to own very safe government securities because they were considered highly liquid by regulators and carried very low capital requirements”. Rules to fix the last crisis — and create “safety” — sometimes create new risks.  4. Beware blind spots  Fourth: bankers need to recognise that cultural patterns matter. They often ignore this — in themselves and others — because they are trained to focus on hard numbers. But it mattered hugely with SVB. Its culture emulated its client base, which was mostly from the tech and start-up worlds, which tend to have a “skew” in their concept of risk: they are willing to take bold bets, knowing that there is a small chance of a massive payout (say, if their brilliant idea goes viral), while thinking that they can always reinvent themselves after a downside risk (ie, their company fails). This, as behavioural economist Colin Camerer notes, is different from finance. “Risk management culture, as it’s usually practised [in banks], is antithetical to the Silicon Valley culture.” It might imply greater information transparency accelerates consumer reaction to news, even outside crises, increasing the risk of ‘herding’ Bankers have their own tribal patterns. Another reason why banks failed to see the looming mortgage risks before 2008 was they were often detached from “real” life (ie, what subprime borrowers were doing with their loans) and different teams inside big investment banks were often fighting each other to protect their bonuses and did not share information.  And right now there is another crucial cultural issue that potentially matters even more: consumer behaviour. Torsten Slok, an economist at Apollo, notes that “the share of [US] households using mobile banking or online banking increased from 39 per cent in 2013 to 66 per cent in 2021”.  Until now, the models used in finance do not seem to have taken account of the fact that consumer behaviour online might be different from that in the old-fashioned, physical banking world. But one striking feature about American banks, even before the March panic, was that consumers were moving money out of low-paying deposit accounts into better-yielding money market funds at a dramatically faster pace than at similar points before in history.   That might imply that greater information transparency accelerates consumer reaction to news, even outside crises, increasing the risk of “herding”. Either way, we urgently need some behavioural finance analysis, since American banks will stay healthy only if they hang on to deposits — and digital herding could increase the risks of turmoil in other markets, such as Treasury bonds, if shocks emerge there too.  5. Don’t bet against bailouts  The fifth lesson is that banks are never “just” businesses. In calm times, bankers dress themselves up in free-market language and talk about their profits and business plans as if they were selling hamburgers, laptops or holidays. But that free-market mantra vanishes when panic erupts, since governments almost always step in to protect some depositors, buy bad assets or even nationalise entire banks. That happened in 1990s Japan and around the world during the global financial crisis. So, too, last month: although deposit insurance was supposed to cover only the first $250,000 of SVB and Signature accounts, the government protected them all, at a cost of more than $20bn. And the Swiss regulators not only protected depositors when Credit Suisse imploded but — controversially — gave some (very small) value to shareholders too. On both sides of the Atlantic central banks have offered liquidity lines to banks (and in America, the Fed is letting banks exchange their holdings of Treasuries for cash at face value, as if rate rises never happened).  Governments do this partly because banking is essential to the wider economy. But also because of contagion. The dangerous weakness of fractional banking is that if nobody has a reason to panic, banks are safe; but if everyone runs, a bank can collapse, even if it previously passed tests on issues such as capital adequacy — unless a government steps in. And while the government never used to worry about smaller banks collapsing, now they fear the digital domino effect.   Maybe governments can contain such risks. After all, the “March madness” — as some journalists and traders now call it — has died down, and the losses have been relatively small to date compared with the previous bank shocks. I can go to dinner without constantly feeling the need to check my phone.  But when I consider the last month, another lesson I learnt from Tokyo and London keeps coming to mind: the trajectory of financial crises can be lengthy, with ebbs and flows. In Japan in the 1990s, the moment of most panic (the collapse of LTCB) came months after the first ructions around Nippon Credit Bank. In the global financial crisis, Lehman Brothers collapsed more than a year after the first subprime mortgage dramas. I desperately hope we will buck history this time — and ensure that investors and regulators around the world quickly learn from the SVB debacle and improve risk management skills. But I also fear that the past decade of quantitative easing has distorted finance so deeply that there will be unexpected chain reactions, if not in banks, then other corners of finance.

"Credit Suisse’s last chance","The FT’s Owen Walker explains how the Swiss bank is trying to make a comeback after years of scandals and losses — and what might happen if it fails ","This is an audio transcript of the Behind the Money podcast episode: ‘Credit Suisse’s last chance’ [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera Earlier this fall, the FT’s Owen Walker was spending his Saturday afternoon sitting in the parking lot of a tile showroom.   Owen WalkerMy kids were asleep in the back of the car and my wife was buying some tiles.  Michela TinderaOwen’s the FT’s European banking correspondent. So that means that even while he’s out on a weekend errand, he’s keeping a close eye on the major banks across the continent in places like France, Spain and Switzerland.  Owen WalkerSo I was just sort of idly flicking through my phone on Twitter. I saw a tweet that came up by an Australian journalist. Word for word, it said, “Credible source told me last night an investment bank is on the brink.” So not much detail. Quite vague. And by this point, it had a couple of hundred retweets, and people were suggesting it might be Credit Suisse.  Michela Tindera At one time, Credit Suisse was considered to be one of the most important and respected banks in Europe. But over the last few years, that reputation has changed. Years of scandal had, by that weekend, sent the bank’s share price to historic lows. Still, on the verge of collapse? Owen thought, no way! Owen WalkerI know a fair bit about the bank. But later on the evening, this tweet was starting to get a lot more traction. There were tens of thousands of people retweeting it by this point. And there was so much speculation on social media that I did start to sort of think, well, is there anything in this? So I started, you know, messaging a few contacts, few people I knew at the bank, just sort of checking in to see had they heard anything? Did they know what all this was coming from? And I started to get messages from my own colleagues and editors sort of saying, you know, we’ve seen what’s going on on Twitter. Have you heard anything? What is going on?  Michela Tindera Owen zeroed in on two possible causes of this rumour mill.   Owen Walker The first was a message sent from Credit Suisse’s chief executive Ulrich Körner to staff on the Friday afternoon, trying to reassure them and saying, there’s no problem here, there’s no liquidity problem. A lot of people on social media said this was very reminiscent of messages sent from the management of Lehman Brothers just a few days before that bank collapsed. The second was the credit default swap market, which is, these are essentially insurance contracts against a company going bust. And the higher the spreads on those derivatives, the more indication that there is a lack of faith in the market and in the financial health of that company. Credit Suisse, those CDs were going through the roof. So people on social media were really putting these two things together and thinking this bank is going down the plughole.  Michela Tindera As it turned out, Owen wasn’t the only one wondering what on earth was going on.  Owen Walker I just got on the phone and spoke to various people, various executives at the bank . . .  Michela TinderaAnd that Monday, Owen had a story to report for the FT.  Owen Walker Which was very much along the lines of, you know, Credit Suisse executives have spent the weekend calling their biggest shareholders and their most valuable clients to reassure them that all this speculation and noise going on on social media is just that, and, you know, they are still a healthy company, admittedly with some problems, but certainly no problems that would see them collapse within a couple of days.  Michela Tindera At the end of the day, of course, Credit Suisse didn’t collapse. The rumours weren’t true.   Owen Walker I think, personally, 95 per cent of the speculation was completely ill informed, and it was people who probably know very little about Credit Suisse or very little about banking.  Michela TinderaEven though these rumours on social media weren’t true, Credit Suisse’s stock fell even further, down nearly 10 per cent the morning after that weekend’s events.  Owen Walker Credit Suisse is in such a bad place that just a few unsubstantiated internet rumours could send its stock price tumbling and cause clients to pull their money in droves. Now, shareholders really have had enough of all the bad headlines.  Michela TinderaRecently, the bank’s leadership has been pressured to restructure in a last-ditch attempt to fix its business and image. Owen says this is a make-it-or-break-it moment for Credit Suisse.  Owen WalkerThis is a story of a bank which is very much on its last legs. If it doesn’t carry out this significant restructure and this isn’t a successful revamp of the bank, there won’t be many options left for it to stay in its present form. You know, this is a 166-year-old institution, which is the pride of Switzerland, which has its roots in helping the country grow. If this plan doesn’t work out, it could be stripped back, sold on and little more exists than just a name Credit Suisse in the history books in a year or two to come.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. On today’s episode of Behind the Money, we’re gonna explain what’s really been happening in Credit Suisse and explore whether it can turn itself around before it’s too late. Owen, well, welcome to the show.  Owen Walker Great. Thanks so much for having me.  Michela TinderaSo tell me about Credit Suisse. Why is this bank so important?  Owen Walker So, you know, Credit Suisse is one of Switzerland’s oldest running banks, and it’s really got that heritage of being a very pivotal part of the Swiss economy. You know, being a Swiss bank, it very much had that privacy, that security that they could offer the world’s wealthiest people. It had a rich heritage in wealth management and then other parts, you know, have that asset management arm and domestic Swiss bank, but also it had this well-regarded investment banking arm as well. And, you know, through the 19th century, through the 20th century, it gradually became much more of an international bank, funding more industry across Europe and eventually into the US. Michela Tindera So now we know that those collapse rumours online were just that, rumours. But over the last few years, Credit Suisse has faced this just laundry list of scandals, and Owen, you’ve reported on many of them. It’s fed this image of a bank on the brink.  News clipCredit Suisse is facing allegations that it has been handling dirty money for decades.  News clipDamage control measures put in place by Credit Suisse.  News clipThe court said Credit Suisse had not done enough to stop money movements by a Bulgarian drug trafficking ring.  Owen Walker By the start of 2021, Credit Suisse was reeling from the collapse of two companies with whom it had very close relationships. The first was Greensill Capital, a specialist financing company. And when that imploded, Credit Suisse was forced to close $10bn worth of investment funds that its wealthiest clients had put their money into. The second was Archegos, a family office, and when that collapsed, Credit Suisse suffered losses of $5.5bn, the largest ever trading loss in its history. This really put Credit Suisse in a lot of people’s minds, as, you know, the bad bank of Europe or probably the most troubled bank in the world, really, because it just lurched from one crisis to another and was losing huge amounts of money. People were leaving. They had whole changes of leadership. Share price collapsed.  Michela Tindera Yeah. So clearly the bank needed to try to navigate its way out of these crises and make up these losses. So in November of 2021, Credit Suisse announced this new strategic plan. What was in that?  Owen WalkerThey thought what they would do is they would start to strip back the investment bank a little bit and refocus some efforts on to wealth management. Now, this was a plan that they’d worked on for several months, but by the time it came out, it was fair to say the market felt that it hadn’t gone far enough. The market had looked at it and thought, this is not radical enough. This does not change the way that we see the bank. Now, by the summer, the share price had fallen over 40 per cent for the year and shareholders were getting restless.  Michela TinderaSo that plan didn’t work. And over the summer, Credit Suisse announced that in late October it would release another new strategic plan. However, while everyone was waiting for that plan, those collapse rumours on social media caught fire. Now just last week, Owen interviewed Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann on stage at an FT conference. And here’s what Lehmann said about how those rumours played out for the bank.  Axel Lehmann First, the professional market, institutional investors, you, and other more professional press analysts, came and said Monday afternoon “No, no, this is not a meltdown. That is not possible. Let get some perspective on it”. So the professional market, counterpart the other banks, were not really reacting to it. But it was a real storm. It was a storm in the retail and partially in the wealth management segment, in particular in Asia, where we had really massive outflows for two to three weeks. And since then it completely flattened out and it partially reversed. So the force and the uncontrollable events in the social media storm, it’s uhm . . . that was unbelievable.  Michela Tindera Owen, how bad did it to get for Credit Suisse in those weeks after that rumour?  Owen Walker In the few weeks after the rumours, it got pretty chaotic for Credit Suisse. Outflows, which is essentially a measurement of the money that clients of a bank take out of their accounts and in most cases move into accounts of rival banks, now, the level of outflows at Credit Suisse reached over SFr80bn in just the first couple of weeks after those rumours. And in the wealth management business, which is where Credit Suisse’s richest clients sit, they poured 60bn, which was about 10 per cent of the assets in that business. Now, analysts looked at those levels and compared them with what UBS went through during the financial crisis, and they said that those levels were what UBS experienced in the whole year during the financial crisis. So this was huge. This is Credit Suisse, one of the world’s biggest wealth managers, losing a 10th of its assets in just a couple of weeks as a result of these social media rumours.  Michela TinderaSo, Owen, in the weeks following what happened online, it sounds like Credit Suisse is really on the defensive here. I mean, they’re in the middle of seeing these significant outflows and everyone’s waiting on this new strategic plan that’s set to come out. And then finally, the bank CEO and the chair, Axel Lehmann, released this plan in late October. Tell me more about it.  Owen Walker They were getting pressure from shareholders. They’re basically told this isn’t working. What you announced last year did not go anywhere near fair enough. And if you don’t sort this out in the next six months, we’re gonna push for you to sell yourself on to UBS or someone else.  Michela TinderaNow, the previous plan wasn’t considered radical enough. What about this one? What’s in it?  Owen Walker So there are essentially three parts to the new plan. One is a quite severe cost cutting exercise, reducing SFr2.5bn and 9,000 jobs from the bank. The second, which is related, is selling off huge chunks of the investment bank and spinning off most of it into its own separate company. And the third part of it is paying for all of this by raising SFr4bn of fresh capital from investors.  Michela Tindera OK. Can you tell me a bit more about each of these? Let’s start with the cost cutting.  Owen Walker So they’re looking to cut costs by SFr2.5bn over the next three years, which is probably about 20 per cent of costs. And that includes cutting 9,000 roles out of the 52,000 global staff. So that’s a pretty big, pretty painful restructuring from a cost base and also from staffing levels. Now, part of those efforts will see the bank really moving out of investment banking in a big way.  Michela TinderaSo what would that look like, selling off large pieces of the investment bank?  Owen WalkerThe key piece here that they’ve already announced a sell-off is the securitised products business, which, although is actually very profitable for Credit Suisse and is an area where the bank is a market leader, it is quite risky. But it also requires an awful lot of capital, and capital is a point that the bank is looking to redirect and make it work more in the wealth management business rather than the investment bank. So that’s one area it’s looking to do. And then in order to make these changes, this is, you know, it’s required quite a lot of money to make these changes. So it’s looking to raise 4bn of fresh capital from investors. Some of these are new investors and some are existing investors who are essentially being asked to invest more in the business to fund this fairly radical restructuring.  Michela TinderaMm hmm. And part of getting this big capital investment is they’ve decided to get the Saudi National Bank involved. Why did that bank want to invest in Credit Suisse?  Owen WalkerYou’ve now got the Saudi National Bank. They are actually more interested in becoming players in the global financial market. So what they are doing with Credit Suisse, they are coming in and they’re investing just under SFr4bn into the business. And at the same time, we’ve reported that the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, which was a large investor in Credit Suisse, already has also decided to increase its stake and become a bigger shareholder in the bank. So I think what you’re seeing here is sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, seeing this an opportunity to strengthen their influence in a very large western financial institution. But also I think they see Credit Suisse as a means of coming in and investing more in the Middle East and investing in the financial hubs in the Middle East, in Doha and Dubai, and making these places where more people will want to come and set up financial businesses, and they see that very much as something they would like to build out. And Credit Suisse can help them do that.  Michela TinderaOwen, as we discussed, you know, those social media rumours had real consequences for Credit Suisse. But Axel Lehmann told you he’s optimistic about the future of the bank. Here’s a bit of what he told you on stage.  Axel LehmannYou know, I have personally a lot of contacts with some of the key clients as executives and also had a lot of, I talked a little bit to our regional managers in Asia, Switzerland but also here in the US. You know, clients, and that’s the good part of the sad story. You know, we had very few clients leaving, and they are still with us. They still continue to do business with us. But, you know, when you have maybe hundred million business or you had a billion business, and then you say, OK, look, oh, I see all that stuff. I might put 300mn or 30mn somewhere else. That money one day, sooner or later, at least in part, will come back. Clients still want us. They still with us. So I have anecdotes from clients. I know that the money will certainly, certainly come back over time.  Michela Tindera So, Owen, how’s Credit Suisse doing now?  Owen Walker Axel Lehmann is really trying to spread the message that, that the, the seeds and the green shoots of a recovery are there. And I think if you’re looking at every other part of the bank, if you’re looking at the share price, if you’re looking at, you know, the way the bond markets were acting, I think there’s a lot of expectation that it really can’t get much worse than it is at the minute.  Michela Tindera Mm hmm. So, tell me a bit more about this.  Owen WalkerIn the past month or so since it unveiled its radical restructuring plan, the group has actually had to announce its fourth profit warning of the year, saying it expects that in January to post up to SFr1.6bn of losses for the final quarter. That would mark probably among the worst years in Credit Suisse’s 166 years as a bank. Two months ago, there was a common joke doing the rounds in Switzerland that it was cheaper to buy Credit Suisse stock than a cup of coffee in Zurich. I mean, I think now you’d be lucky to find a bar of, a mini bar of Swiss chocolate that’s cheaper than the share price.  Michela Tindera What might happen if the bank is sold off?  Owen WalkerYou know, there’s often rumours and talk that UBS would buy the bank if it was up for sale. I think that would certainly be the preference of a lot of politicians and regulators in Switzerland rather than having an overseas bank come in and buy essentially the finance sector’s crown jewels. So, you know, there is a very much a feeling, I think, in Zurich that if this plan doesn’t pay off, then there’s only one option, which is to either completely strip down the bank and to sell off into parts or to sell it on to UBS and to kind of create a one dominant Swiss bank which plays out internationally and then maybe a more locally, domestically focused bank, which would be separate from the combined bank. So I think this is kind of the last chance saloon really for keeping Credit Suisse in any kind of single form going forward.  Michela TinderaWhen will we know if they’ve been successful? Owen Walker I suppose it’s a three-year restructuring plan. So, you know, they would say judge us in three years. I don’t think there’s a lot of patience in the market to judge them in three years' time. I think shareholders, analysts, bondholders, they want to see tangible results in the next six months. They want to see what parts of the business they’re able to sell, what valuations they can get for those businesses, what the financials look like, how far the cost cutting goes, how successful they are in doing this, and to be brutal, they want to see blood. They want to see job cuts, and they want to see the bank stripped down. I think what we’ve had so far is the bank’s executives have shown the plan. But what the shareholders will now want to see is thanks very much. It looks like a plan we can support, but we want to see action. We want to see you carrying this out. And that’s what we will judge you on.  Michela Tindera Owen, thanks for joining me.  Owen WalkerNo problem.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Behind the Money is hosted by me, Michela Tindera.

"Xi Jinping set to overhaul China’s economic policy team at watershed congress","President expected to unveil sweeping changes to extend Communist party’s grip over finance and other sectors","Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, is preparing to use the upcoming rubber-stamp parliamentary session to launch a “forceful” overhaul of the government by appointing his most trusted acolytes to oversee the financial, technology and other sectors. The annual National People’s Congress, which kicks off on Sunday, will replace Premier Li Keqiang, the head of government, and his team of technocrats that has been credited with steering the economy through the turmoil of the past five years. Important portfolios such as the financial sector may also be restructured. Xi pledged at a meeting on Tuesday that the party was planning “far-reaching” changes, which aside from financial sector reform would include exerting closer control over the technology and science sectors and — perhaps most ominously for business — increased party involvement in “non-public enterprises”.  The changes come at a sensitive moment for China’s economy, which was hamstrung by Xi’s draconian zero-Covid strategy last year and regulatory crackdowns on the tech and property sectors that have damaged business sentiment. Gross domestic product in 2022 grew just 3 per cent, well below the official target of 5.5 per cent. While growth is expected to rebound this year — manufacturing activity grew at its fastest monthly pace in a decade last month — the new team will have to convince sceptical investors that China has reopened for business in earnest and is ready to tackle longstanding structural headwinds including rising government debt, population decline and lagging productivity. “The top priority of the congress will be to chart a course for growth both in the short term and to try to convince domestic and foreign investors that there is a path for long-term sustainable growth,” said Victor Shih, professor of Chinese political economy at the University of California, San Diego.  In October, Xi executed a clean sweep of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, stacking the Chinese Communist party’s highest decision-making body with loyalists at the quinquennial party congress. Xi was also confirmed as party secretary and military chief for a third five-year term, a precedent-shattering move set up in 2018 when the NPC changed the constitution to scrap a two-term limit. This month, the parliament will complete the formalities by reappointing Xi as president. He is expected to mirror the reshuffle of the CCP’s leadership in the government’s top ranks, which will boast a team of new faces drawn heavily from Xi’s past.  The Chinese leader is expected to elevate Li Qiang, the former Shanghai party chief whom Xi worked with as governor of Zhejiang province in the 2000s, to premier and head of China’s State Council, or cabinet.  Also expected to be replaced is China’s economic tsar, vice-premier Liu He, a Harvard-trained economist who is widely credited with launching a financial “de-risking” campaign in 2017 to restrict shadow banking and debt accumulation and prevent a financial crisis. The administration, which warned against flooding the economy with stimulus, managed to slow — though not stop — the expansion of China’s debt, which has reached 273 per cent of GDP from 150 per cent before the global financial crisis, according to Gavekal Dragonomics, a research group. By contrast, officials such as He Lifeng, a Xi protégé who is expected to replace Liu, spent most of his career as a local politician. He might be more inclined to answer immediate political needs at the expense of conservative long-term monetary policy, analysts said. “Of course, we know the central bank has always been a government organ that obeys the overall direction of the Communist party. That’s by design,” said Shih. “But it has been run by career technocrats for decades. “By appointing career local government politicians . . . that could have the effect of putting short-term political objectives well ahead of medium-term policy objectives.”  In a further move that will consolidate control over policymaking, the party has discussed a proposal to set up a super committee overseeing the central bank and other financial regulators, two people familiar with the matter said.  If adopted at the NPC, the new entity would be a more powerful party-led version of an existing body, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, which is supervised by the State Council, the people said.  While the existing committee only co-ordinates financial regulation between bodies, the new committee would be empowered to quickly make decisions on cross-sector risks such as the collapse of Evergrande, the country’s most indebted property developer, the people said. The top candidates to lead the new body are He and Ding Xuexiang, Xi’s powerful chief of staff. Lu Zhiyuan, the party chief of the coastal city of Qingdao, meanwhile, is among the top candidates for finance minister.  Whatever doubts market watchers might harbour about Xi’s new administration, it will benefit in the near term from an economic rebound triggered by the end of zero-Covid, analysts said. The NPC is expected to set a full-year GDP growth target of 5-5.5 per cent, said UBS economist Tao Wang, adding the new government could also try to boost growth by channelling more funds to the property sector or to boost consumption. “I also see upside from policies that could be a bit more supportive than expected,” Wang said. Economists, however, pointed to the challenge of sustaining higher growth beyond the post-coronavirus rebound, especially if China is to achieve its goal of becoming a “moderately prosperous” society by 2035.  This would require average annual growth of 3.5 per cent through 2035 to reach the threshold of $20,000 of income per capita per year, said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley. “It’s more about the next debate beyond this one-off boost,” said Xing. Achieving sustainable long-term growth would require daunting decisions on questions such as how to boost consumption as a share of activity in an economy that still invests too much as a percentage of GDP and how to resolve growing local government debt, analysts said. “We’ll probably get good growth this year and everyone will be happy,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University. “But it’s only temporary.” Xi’s new team — a closer lookLi Qiang, who oversaw last year’s lockdown of Shanghai as its Communist party chief, is expected to replace Li Keqiang as premier, China’s second-highest ranking official. Li Qiang worked with Xi when the latter was governor of Zhejiang province in the 2000s, a post he assumed himself in 2013.He Lifeng, a Xi protégé from the president’s time in Fujian province, is expected to replace Liu He as vice-premier. He could also be appointed as the powerful party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, which would be the first time a vice-premier has occupied the role since the 1990s.Lu Zhiyuan, the party chief of the coastal city Qingdao and a former senior official in Xi’s native Shaanxi province, is among the top candidates for finance minister.Zhu Hexin, chair of the state-owned conglomerate Citic Group, is expected to replace Yi Gang, the governor of the People’s Bank of China.Yi Huiman, current head of the securities regulator, is expected to replace banking regulator Guo Shuqing.","02.03.2023"
"US stocks notch largest weekly gains in two months","Cooling inflation boosts chances of US central bank lifting rates by 0.25 percentage points","US stocks notched their largest weekly gains in two months as earnings season kicked off and traders took economic indicators showing easing inflation as a sign that the Federal Reserve would not have to be as aggressive in raising interest rates this year. Wall Street’s blue-chip S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent on Friday, taking the weekly gain to 2.7 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent, taking gains over the past five sessions to 4.8 per cent. The indices had their largest weekly advances since mid-November, and notched back-to-back weekly gains following four weeks of consecutive losses.  The week’s rally was driven by data that showed annual US inflation declined for the sixth consecutive month to 6.5 per cent, the lowest consumer price index reading in more than a year. Signs of slowing price growth built on momentum from last week, when figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed average hourly earnings rose by less than expected in December, while companies such as Amazon, Meta, Twitter and Goldman Sachs have begun job cuts. Rates markets priced in a higher probability that the Fed will slow the pace of its monetary tightening at its next meeting in February, with a 0.25 percentage point rise firmly expected to follow December’s half a percentage point increase. “The Fed is getting closer to the end of the rate hiking cycle, which we believe is likely by the end of the first quarter,” said analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management. Even so, the “tightness of the labour market” means rates are unlikely to fall any time soon, with the US unemployment rate at a 50-year low, jobs vacancy rates elevated and the quit rate — “which is correlated with wage growth” — too high to justify a so-called Fed pivot any time soon. Investors are beginning to turn their attention to earnings season, which stepped up a gear Friday with a mixed set of results for some of America’s biggest finance groups. Year-on-year net income inched higher at Bank of America and JPMorgan, while Wells Fargo’s quarterly profit halved from a year ago primarily due to a hit from multibillion-dollar fines. Asset manager BlackRock reported a 15 per cent decline in revenues. Although investors are weighing the medium-term outlook for the sector against debate about a potential recession this year, lenders have broadly benefited from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to raise interest rates. Concerns in the market over a looming recession meant analysts last year lowered their earnings per share estimates for S&P 500 companies by 6.5 per cent for the fourth quarter, a larger margin than average, according to FactSet.  US government bonds sold off on Friday, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is particularly sensitive to interest rate expectations, rising 0.1 percentage points to 4.23 per cent, having peaked at 4.7 per cent in November. “Treasury yields tend to decline by 50 to 60 [basis points] on average once the Fed goes on hold, and with our final expected rate hike still over two months away, this rally seems somewhat premature,” said analysts at JPMorgan. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said even if inflation fell past 4 per cent late this year, permitting looser monetary policy, “markets will still be challenged due to earnings concerns”. “If inflation plateaus there, then the Fed will have very little space to cut rates this year,” Shah added. “Not a great outcome, either way.” A measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of six other currencies was 0.1 per cent lower on Friday, after declining 0.9 per cent in the previous session. The world’s de facto reserve currency has shed almost 10 per cent over the past three months. Elsewhere in equity markets, Europe’s Stoxx 600 added 0.5 per cent, London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.6 per cent to nudge closer to an all-time high and Germany’s Dax added 0.2 per cent.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1 per cent and China’s CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed shares added 1.4 per cent. Data released on Friday showed China’s exports suffered the sharpest fall in almost three years in December, declining 9.9 per cent on an annual basis in dollar terms.","13.01.2023"
"Investors’ Chronicle: Lok’n Store, Wizz Air, Aston Martin Lagonda","Companies analysis from our sister publication ","BUY: Lok’n Store (LOK)  The storage company’s development pipeline is the key to driving its growth, writes Mark Robinson. Lok’n Store was one of the leading risers on Aim after the self-storage company announced a 37 per cent rise in cash profits to £16.4mn. The strong annual showing was driven by a 13 per cent increase on the achieved rate on occupied space combined with a 6.4 percentage point reduction in total operating costs as a proportion of revenues to 38.5 per cent. That’s doubly impressive when set against an inflationary backdrop. And sale and manage-back arrangements have been carried out at a premium, helping to reduce net debt and boost cash available for distribution. The self-storage industry was something of an outlier during the pandemic, at least in relation to some other property-based sectors which saw occupancy rates and rents affected by the lockdowns. The consequent spread of hybrid working arrangements has also had a positive impact. And even seemingly tangential issues such as the rental crisis have increased the number of people who need a unit to store their belongings.  Management is looking to meet this increasing demand through a development pipeline that will expand store space by 44.1 per cent over the medium term. Of the 14 pipeline sites, 10 are contracted and four are “progressing with lawyers”. Secular trends are favourable, but the development pipeline is key to driving growth and the sole justification for a lofty consensus earnings multiple of 30 times forecast earnings. The company’s net asset value increased by 33 per cent in full-year 2022, but it would be fanciful to imagine that will be the standard rate going forward, even though trading in August and September was 13.6 per cent up on the same period last year. HOLD: Wizz Air (WIZZ) While the second-half showing was encouraging, the strong dollar put a sizeable dent in Wizz’s bottom line, writes Christopher Akers. It was a tale of two quarters for the budget airline, which focuses on Central and eastern Europe and has expanded into the Middle East. Operational performance “normalised” as the year went on, with flight cancellations and disruption returning to historical levels. Revenues in the second quarter were up by 41 per cent against the pre-pandemic rate, with strong cash profits of €218mn (£188mn) recorded. A pretty solid showing. But a challenging first quarter, in which Wizz faced a doubling of fuel prices from pre-pandemic levels, together with the continuing impact of pandemic restrictions and supply chain disruption, cast a pall over the whole. And Wizz wasn’t helped by the dollar’s strength against the euro, given it reports in the latter currency. This dragged the company down to a significantly worse statutory loss, with an eye-watering 905 per cent increase taking the net foreign exchange loss to €269mn.  It is good news that Wizz has changed tack on its former no-hedging policy around the dollar and jet fuel costs. The result of this policy is seen in the company’s negative year-to-date share price performance against competitors such as easyJet and Ryanair due to its greater exposure to manic fuel prices. The company said that “given the sustained and ongoing volatility in commodity prices” it will reinstate jet fuel hedging (in line with peers from 2024) and will hedge its dollar exposure. Peel Hunt analysts said that “with rapid fleet growth and a pivot to the Middle East, [Wizz] will continue to expand quickly, using its low cost base to increase market share”. The shares trade at only four times the broker’s financial year 2025 earnings forecast, which is notably undemanding. SELL: Aston Martin Lagonda (AML) Free cash outflow increases by £100mn during the third quarter, writes Michael Fahy. For a company specialising in making machines built for speed, Aston Martin Lagonda is taking a long time to turn its fortunes around. A £654mn capital raise during the period, which brought in Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund as the company’s second-biggest shareholder with an 18.67 per cent stake and China’s Geely Automotive with 7.6 per cent, was welcome news given its stretched finances. However, it continues to haemorrhage cash — its year-to-date free cash outflow increased to £336mn, up from £234mn at the half-year stage. Almost two-thirds of this is capital expenditure devoted to the development of a new generation of sports cars, which will begin production from next year.  The problem, though, is that it continues to struggle to deliver its existing order book. The company cited “supply chain challenges” affecting the delivery of DBX models over the past six months, which meant wholesale volumes are down by about 4 per cent year-to-date. Parts shortages meant the company had 400 cars waiting to be delivered at the end of September, which it expects to find their way to owners by the end of the year. The company is also having to accelerate the amortisation of capitalised research and development costs as new models replace its existing range, but its biggest headache remains its £833mn net debt. The fact that this is largely dollar-denominated doesn’t help — it attributed around half of its year-to-date pre-tax loss of £511mn to a “non-cash FX revaluation” of its borrowings. The recent fundraising should help it to make inroads into paying this off, but until the company can generate cash — let alone make a profit — from building cars its shares remain one to avoid. Hermione Taylor: US dollar — their currency, your problem  The US Treasury Secretary told a room of European counterparts that “the dollar is our currency, but it is your problem”. This soundbite is actually more than 50 years old – courtesy of 1971’s Treasury Secretary, John Connally. But what was true then rings true now: concerns about the spillover effects of a dollar rally are nothing new. The dollar has surged again over the past year, causing headaches for both advanced and emerging economies. But in the past, US policymakers have agreed to international action to curb the strength of the dollar. Is there a chance that they will do so again today?  For the rest of the world, a strong dollar increases import costs, stoking domestic inflationary pressures. Thanks to the dollar’s status as the world’s most traded currency, this means far more than pricey American imports: in much of Europe, for example, energy is purchased abroad using US dollars. According to S&P Global, the 16 per cent depreciation of the euro against the dollar in the past 12 months has added about half a point to eurozone inflation figures, and reduced household consumption by the same amount. A stronger dollar also increases the cost of servicing any borrowing denominated in US dollars – bad news for net debtors.  A strong dollar exerts its own pressure on the US economy, too. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that for every 10 per cent increase in the value of the dollar, US GDP takes a 0.7 percentage point hit. This would be bad news in normal times, but it comes as a welcome relief of sorts at a time of high demand-driven inflation: the dollar’s recent appreciation is set to reduce core goods inflation by about 0.5 percentage points, largely thanks to lower import prices.  Yet the benefits are not felt evenly. US firms reliant on sales in overseas markets take a hit when profits earned in foreign currencies are converted back into US dollars. Figures from S&P Global suggest that large global car makers saw sales decrease by up to 10 per cent in the first half of 2022, due to their exposure to weakening foreign currencies. The ratings agency’s economists note that “at some point a strong dollar becomes less than optimal for all involved and if markets do not correct, the solution will have a political element”. In 1985, the Plaza Accord saw US, German, French, Japanese and UK central banks agree to FX interventions designed to bring down the value of the dollar. But despite talk of a modern equivalent, any international agreement looks unlikely today.  Firstly, the incentive for the US to intervene is minimal. In the 1980s, the US was more concerned about the impact of a strong dollar on its current account position, whereas today, inflation dominates as a macroeconomic policy objective. Analysts at Goldman Sachs argue that comments from Fed officials “suggest that they remain focused on taming domestic inflation and currently do not see spillovers as large enough to require an adjustment to monetary policy”.  International action is harder to orchestrate today, too. In 1985, the Plaza Accord was agreed by a small group of core countries and in an environment where FX intervention was the norm. Crucially, China was absent from Plaza Accord negotiations, owing to its small economy at the time. UBS economists argue that for China, a strong dollar may be no bad thing at the moment, either: as the Chinese housing market and domestic economy slows, a depreciating renminbi could increase the competitiveness of Chinese exports – and deliver a much needed economic stimulus.  UBS analysis also suggests that any agreement today would be within the purview of a much broader contingent of G20 countries. This group is already sensitive to disorderly market movements and any currency manipulations that could confer a trading advantage. Unsurprisingly, UBS economists conclude that “there is a higher bar for reaching an international agreement than was the case in the 1980s”. The strong dollar may well be a global problem, but reaching an international consensus on exchange rates looks like an even bigger challenge.  Hermione Taylor is an economics writer for Investors’ Chronicle","04.11.2022"
"US stocks stumble after hotter than expected services data","Chinese equities surge as Beijing eases zero-Covid restrictions","US stocks fell and bond yields surged after data showed the vast American services sector was still growing, even though the Federal Reserve has been trying to cool the world’s biggest economy with aggressive interest rate rises. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1.9 per cent in the session. Both indices had their largest daily declines since November 9, the day after the US midterm elections. The declines followed the release on Monday morning of a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing its index tracking economic activity in the services sector expanded for the 30th month in a row in November, rising to 56.5 from 54.4 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to decline to 53.3. A number over 50 signals growth.  The decline for US stocks partly reversed Wall Street’s steady march higher over the past fortnight on hopes that inflation may have peaked, which could prompt the Fed to this month slow its pace of rate rises. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, warned the services sector was unlikely to remain quite so buoyant for long, however.  “We suspect that resilience will fade next year, as higher interest rates start to take a bigger toll,” Hunter said. The US dollar index, a measure of the US currency’s strength against six of its peers, rose 0.8 per cent as traders reassessed the inflationary outlook.  Prices of US government bonds fell, with the yield on the interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasury rising 0.12 percentage points to 4.40 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note added 0.1 percentage points to 3.6 per cent.  Oil markets fell, with international benchmark Brent crude declining by 3.4 per cent to $82.68 a barrel after the Opec cartel and its allies opted not to alter its production targets in response to the EU’s move to bar seaborne Russian crude imports, which took effect on Monday. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate dropped 3.8 per cent to $76.93 a barrel.  Russian output was expected to fall “moderately” following the EU’s ban, before dropping off again in February when western restrictions on the country’s refined petroleum products kicked in, said analysts at UBS.   Reports that several cities across China had relaxed Covid-19 restrictions boosted equities in Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index finished 4.5 per cent higher. The index has risen more than 17 per cent in the past month. China’s CSI 300 index added 2 per cent. Top movers in the latter included China Railway Group and infrastructure group China Communications Construction, both of which gained more than 10 per cent. “Investor confidence in China-related assets and currencies is being boosted by reopening optimism,” said MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman, who added that the dollar remained “vulnerable” to further weakening even after slipping more than 8 per cent from its late September high. Elsewhere in equity markets, Europe’s regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.4 per cent after data out on Monday showed a 1.8 per cent decline in eurozone retail turnover in October — the biggest monthly drop of the year. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.2 per cent.","05.12.2022"
"What do Ukrainians think about the international response to Russia’s war?","Other charts of the week: AI chatbot usage, tourism recovers after Covid, varying retirement ages and the top gaming consoles","Ukrainians strongly approve of how the UK and US responded to Russia’s full-scale invasion last year — but they have a much less positive view of the role China has played, according to a poll.  The November survey of 1,000 Ukrainians logged net approval ratings of 77 per cent for the UK and 76 per cent for the US. The research was conducted in the same month that Rishi Sunak paid his first visit to Kyiv as British prime minister. US president Joe Biden visited the Ukrainian capital in a surprise trip this month.  Ukrainians scored China’s response to the invasion at a net -37 per cent, the lowest in the survey, although half of respondents replied to the question by saying that either their view was neither positive nor negative, or they did not know.  Ukrainians were also unenthusiastic about the response of the UN, giving it a net score of -2 per cent. Nato scored 32 per cent while the G7 was on 39 per cent and the EU got the best net favourability rating of all supranational organisations, at 61 per cent. Alan Smith Our other charts of the week . . .   Artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT has become speedily popular, amassing 1mn users within five days of its launch according to the company itself. A UBS study found that two months after its launch, ChatGPT had reached 100mn active users.  By contrast, most of the world’s best-used apps took months to reach the 1mn mark.  ChatGPT, which produces text in multiple languages as well as programming code, was launched by research company OpenAI in November.  Its popularity has driven competitors to develop their own AI-powered chatbots.   Earlier this month Google announced it planned to launch Bard, a conversational AI service. Similarly, Microsoft said it would launch a new Bing search powered by OpenAI’s language model that is “more powerful than ChatGPT and customised specifically for search”.  Baidu plans to launch a chatbot named Ernie in its search engine in the next few months. Serena Chan  Tourists are flocking back to hotspots around the world as the industry rebounds after its pandemic-related crisis.  The biggest beneficiary has been the Middle East, where visitor levels are back to those of early 2020, before coronavirus hit, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. Volumes have almost recovered in most of the rest of the world; the main exception is Asia and the Pacific, where tourism numbers remain less than half their pre-pandemic level.   The most affected area is north-east Asia, as countries like China maintained strict Covid restrictions until recently. In December last year the region welcomed just a fifth as many international tourists as it did two years previously. Amy Borrett  Men in France and Belgium tend to retire from the labour force earliest of all rich nations, according to data from the OECD.  They retire 4.1 years earlier than the age the OECD defines as “normal” for retirement — when all pension schemes become eligible without penalty. Belgian women retire 4.9 years earlier than “normal”, also the earliest for women in the OECD club of rich nations.  At the other end of the spectrum is Turkey, where male workers spend 8.7 years longer in the labour force than “normal”, and female workers 10.3 years more. However Turkey’s official retirement age is considerably younger than those of its peers.  While most nations saw the same trend among both male and female workers, Italy, Mexico, Sweden, Austria, Israel and Poland were outliers. The first three saw men stay in labour force longer, while women exited earlier. In Austria, Israel and Poland, men exited earlier but women continued to work for longer. Shotaro Tani  Late last year the Nintendo Switch became the third best-selling gaming console of all time, overtaking the company’s Game Boy which was released in 1989. Can the Switch overtake Sony’s PlayStation 2, the best selling console? Maybe; it is less than 30mn units behind that record, and counting.  But in its seventh year, Switch sales are slowing. Nintendo expects to sell 18mn Switch units in the fiscal year 2023, some 21 per cent lower than the previous year.  PS2 sales reached 155mn in 2012, 12 years after it was launched and long after its successor the PlayStation 3 went on sale.  If the Switch is set for a similar lifespan, it has another couple of years to rack up sales — and that could be enough to power it to the top of the chart.  Shotaro Tani  All primary school pupils in London will receive free school meals for a year, according to plans announced this week by London mayor Sadiq Khan.  The £130mn plan will benefit 270,000 children, many of whom do not qualify for the government’s free school meals scheme but whose families still struggle to afford healthy meals.  It is a nationwide issue. In 439 interviews with English primary schoolteachers last August, 81 per cent said that the number of children coming to school hungry had increased in the past six months.  These students exhibited excessive tiredness and found it harder to concentrate, making it more difficult to learn, according to many of the teachers surveyed.

"Asset managers’ ‘dirty bets’ on coal","Plus, a look behind Saudi Arabia’s big talk on renewable energy","This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.Visit our Moral Money hub for all the latest ESG news, opinion and analysis from around the FT  Along with the rest of the FT, we’ve been watching the spectacular implosion of FTX, particularly how the crypto exchange muddied the waters of what counts as ethical business.  Its fallen founder Sam Bankman-Fried was an enthusiastic proponent of “effective altruism”, pledging to make vast amounts of money to help save the world by giving it away. The business flaunted its sustainability credentials with an advertising blitz introducing its new ESG adviser, the supermodel Gisele Bündchen. Now FTX’s governance catastrophe is adding to the backlash against ESG — as you can see from this Wall Street Journal editorial, claiming that Bankman-Fried has become “an ESG truth-teller” by revealing the whole agenda to be “a fraud”. In its own way, Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, is also grappling with how to define what counts as ethical investing. It said this week it was planning to downgrade the majority of the €45bn it holds in the EU’s “greenest” fund category, Article 9, because of confusion over the rules for what such funds can include.  Today we look at one of the thorniest issues within the ethical investment debate: coal, the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels driving the climate crisis. As the wider market moves towards greener energy, who is still willing to run the risk of financing coal mines, and why? (Kenza Bryan) Research shines a light on big investors’ coal exposure Why are some institutional investors so heavily invested in coal miners? The usual response is they are simply tracking the global economy, in a world where coal remains a big source of power.  But new research compiled by academics at University College Dublin, and shared exclusively with Moral Money, suggests that some big institutional investors have much greater exposure to coal than they would if they simply mirrored the overall market. The research examined the exposure of large institutional investors to bonds issued by 41 of the world’s biggest publicly listed coal miners by market capitalisation, identified by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). TPI is a project led by the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, which analyses the transition pathways of more than 400 of the world’s largest public companies in high-emitting sectors, including coal, oil and gas, aerospace and shipping. How much coal bond exposure would an investor have if they merely tracked the market? As a rough proxy for this, the researchers used Vanguard, the world’s second-biggest asset manager and pioneer of passive tracker funds, which account for the large bulk of its $8tn under management.  The research found that Vanguard held $105bn in bonds issued by companies tracked by TPI — the largest figure of any global investor. Of this sum, 0.73 per cent was in coal bonds. Vanguard declined to comment.  But that figure was far higher for many other big investors. For 20 of them, it was above 3 per cent, meaning their relative exposure to coal bonds was more than four times Vanguard’s, and in some cases more than 10 times. Among those 20 institutions were the asset management arms of banks including HSBC, UBS and Santander, with respective exposures, using the methodology explained above, of 3.1, 3.5 and 5.7 per cent. These three banks have all pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050 in their equity and fixed income portfolios as members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Santander told us it was monitoring its portfolio exposure to coal to reach its goal of having no exposure to thermal coal mining worldwide by 2030. HSBC and UBS declined to comment.  The decision to own coal bonds is significant because coal companies with the biggest expansion plans now raise 2.5 times more capital through the bond markets than through traditional bank loans, according to the Sunrise Project non-profit network.  “These managers are making actively dirty bets across their entire portfolios and putting more money in coal than the benchmark [Vanguard],” said Andreas Hoepner, one of the researchers at UCD. “They are financing the wrong thing, in very large proportions.”  The International Energy Agency estimates coal consumption will peak in 2023, but the high number of coal projects under way tells a different story. Coal production capacity has risen in recent years, and about 1,000 new coal-fired power plants are in the pipeline, mainly in Asia, according to non-profit group Reclaim Finance. These could remain in operation until well after 2060, it said.  The average maturity of coal-related bonds identified in the UCD data was after 2030.  The highest coal bond exposures of all in the study were at four independent US investment groups: Baird Financial, Lord Abbett, MFS Investment, and Loomis Sayles, with relative figures (using the methodology outlined above) ranging from 9.1 to 8.8 per cent. New-Jersey based US investment manager Lord Abbett told me it had a “constructive view of coal”. It does not employ industry or sector level exclusions in its portfolio, and its exposures are the result of “individual, bottom-up security selection”. Boston-based MFS said it believed in “the power of active ownership”, which allows for “ongoing, nuanced dialogue providing an in-depth understanding” of the companies it invests in. Other interesting names on the list were the Washington State Investment Board and the Knights of Columbus — a male-only Boston-based Catholic fraternal organisation that offers funds “specifically designed for Catholic investors”. The WSIB said the coal-mining bonds identified represented just 0.6% of its fixed-income assets. Knights of Columbus declined to comment. Baird Financial and Loomis Sayles did not respond to a request for comment.   Stephanie Maier, head of sustainable and impact investing at the Swiss asset manager GAM — which ranks 12th in UCD’s coal bond top 20 — called for governments to build carbon pricing models that will accelerate the flow of capital towards cleaner energy. “The point is this is not something to look at in isolation: signals from government policy are key,” Maier told me. GAM’s exposure to coal companies included in the analysis is through two large companies for which thermal coal represents a small proportion of revenues, and which have transition plans in place, she said. GAM’s exposure as highlighted by the data also includes assets outside its direct investment management business. “If there’s a very small exposure and the company has committed to transition away from coal, having engaged investors can drive positive outcomes”, she said. But Maier hinted that GAM could yet revise its position on coal bonds. “We recognise that as shareholders and as bondholders we have different leverage points for engagement. Considering whether we would participate in future bond issuances is one of those leverage points,” she said.  Asset managers with much higher proportional exposure to coal than the “behemoths” of the passive world should at the very least be explaining which of their funds include coal, said Ulf Erlandsson, founder of the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute research group. This would help “start the discussion” with retail investors about whether their cash helps back the coal industry, he argued. (Kenza Bryan) Smart read Saudi Arabia was blamed last week for what many said was a soft stance on fossil fuels at COP27.

"The energy mega-deal stuck in the pipeline ","Also in today’s newsletter, are the new solar sector subsidies worth the cost?","This article is an on-site version of our Energy Source newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday Hello and welcome back to Energy Source. Energy will be near the top of the agenda as leaders from the world’s top economies gather in Japan this week for the G7 summit.  My colleagues reported over the weekend that European leaders want to ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow has cut supplies, which would escalate the energy war. If enacted, the move would put a significant barrier up for any potential energy rapprochement down the road. Japan’s climate strategy, which leans heavily on hydrogen and ammonia, will also be under scrutiny.   In today’s newsletter, I look at a big pipeline deal between Oneok and Magellan Midstream, and what it says about the profound shift under way in the American energy landscape. Amanda looks at US rules aimed at bringing solar and other clean energy supply chains back to the US. They’re raising more questions than answers. Thanks for reading — Justin A big pipeline deal Oneok’s mega-deal to buy rival pipeline builder Magellan Midstream for $19bn went down like a lead balloon with the company’s investors.  Oneok’s shares closed down 9 per cent yesterday, following the purchase announcement on Sunday.  The deal would create a new pipeline behemoth worth about $60bn. But investors are questioning the commercial logic from Oneok in stepping out of its core natural gas transportation business to buy Magellan’s crude and refined fuels pipelines. It will be difficult to wring efficiencies out of the disparate businesses, analysts said. Executives at the companies, both of which are based in the tight knit oil and gas community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, will have a hard sell in the coming weeks. But the deal also speaks to broader shifts under way in the US energy landscape. The end of shale’s growth era is likely to boost megadeals The shale boom era caused a surge in US oil and gas production that transformed the country into an energy superpower; hundreds of billions of dollars were spent drilling new wells during this period.   For pipeline builders — the so-called midstream part of the industry — the peak shale era brought its own wealth of opportunities. As gushers of oil and natural gas suddenly erupted in places such as North Dakota and Pennsylvania, the US needed a vast expansion of the plumbing that moves fuel around the country. Cue a decade-plus long boom that led to thousands of miles of new pipelines.  The growth story is not over in the US oil and gas patch — but the associated pipeline building bonanza has largely run its course and an increasingly inhospitable regulatory environment has waylaid a number of big projects. That makes acquisitions one of few remaining paths to growth. Or as Raoul LeBlanc, a vice-president at S&P Global Commodities Insights, told Myles: “Everyone built out the pipeline infrastructure for the shale revolution. Now that shale is in harvest mode and it is nearly impossible to build new pipelines, it is not surprising to see big mergers taking place — period. Expect more.”  The pipeline business, reimagined  Now, pipeline companies are starting to think about how their fossil-fuel dependent businesses will fair in the energy transition.  That has some companies starting to look for new growth in moving around low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen and biofuels or transporting carbon dioxide from carbon capture and storage projects — although none of those businesses really exist at any scale today.  Pierce Norton, Oneok’s boss, told analysts on Monday that the new company’s bigger size would make it better prepared for the big changes coming down the pipe.   “Scale does matter going into the future, especially going into wherever energy is going,” Norton said on a call with analysts.  “As far as hydrogen and . . . renewable fuels, those kind of things that can move through these [pipelines]. The future is going to determine that. It’s going to be determined by what the customers are desiring and the cost. But having these two companies combine sets us up for that opportunity,” he said. A test for Biden’s trust busters The scale of the transaction — and the fraught energy politics of the moment — mean the deal will draw a sceptical look from the administration of Joe Biden.  The president took aim at the oil and gas industry as high fuel prices drove up inflation last year — and has told regulators to be on the lookout for price gouging or other evidence of collusion leading to higher prices. It has also said it wants to curb corporate power more broadly.  This will be the biggest deal in the oil and gas industry to come before the administration and will no doubt come under the microscope. The Federal Trade Commission, which has taken a more adversarial position under its leader Lina Khan, has been scrutinising shale gas producer EQT’s $5.2bn deal to buy private producer Tug Hill for months on anti-competition grounds. Analysts at UBS say the deal faces “limited risk” from regulators. But it will be closely watched across an industry primed for a wave of big deals. (Justin Jacobs)  New US subsidy rule shuts out solar developers The Biden administration sent the solar industry into disarray on Friday when it released confusing tax credit rules for developers that use US-made materials.  The landmark Inflation Reduction Act included a 30 per cent investment tax credit for clean energy developers, with an additional 10 per cent bonus if they use domestic products. But to qualify for the bonus, at least 40 per cent of the project costs must come from US-made components. This proportion increases to 55 per cent after 2026.  The tax credit reflects the administration’s twin goals of decarbonising quickly while simultaneously reducing reliance on Chinese supply.  Up until Friday, developers weren’t sure how the Treasury would define a US-made product. While the new guidance won’t have much of an impact on the pace of solar deployment, it will influence how the US supply chain for solar takes shape. “When you look at all these companies that have made announcements to open factories in the US, this [guidance] is going to slow them down,” said Jim Wood, chief executive of SEG Solar, a module manufacturer in Houston. Wood expects his company’s modules to qualify for the bonus credit. Here are three takeaways for the solar industry:  1. Solar cells (basically) have to be made in the US The new rules do not explicitly say solar cells have to be made in the US, but it will be hard to qualify for the full tax credit if they are made elsewhere given cells make up the bulk of production costs.  Because the US solar supply chain is in its infancy, hardly any developers will qualify for the full tax credit. The US has virtually no cell production and only produced enough modules to meet half of demand in 2022, according to Wood Mackenzie.  2. The decarbonisation vs deglobalisation debate rages on The Biden administration’s guidance pleased few folks. While developers were frustrated they were locked out of the full tax credit, a handful of politicians and industry groups were angry the government didn’t take a tougher stance. The Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition called the guidance a “missed opportunity” to spur production in upstream components like polysilicon and wafers. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin said the guidance “rewards” the continuation of Chinese dominance.  It’s hard to say a ruling isn’t strict enough if it would immediately render most modules ineligible for the full tax credit. If the US truly wanted to make a political statement with its subsidy, it could require all components to be domestically sourced, but that would make it even more difficult for developers to use US products in the tax credit’s 10-year timeframe. Plus, upstream manufacturers have their own IRA subsidies to monetise.  3. Questions remain over whether the tax credit pays off  Friday’s guidance might be so stringent that it disincentivises domestic product consumption. Calculating product costs will require developers to request more information from their manufacturers, many of whom don’t have this information.  “The domestic manufacturers who wanted to force more of the materials to be made in the US got their way, but it’s not administrable,” said Keith Martin, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, who predicts that the manufacturers who can offer cost clarity will charge products at a premium.  By contrast, south-east Asian modules are cheaper and readily available. Wood Mackenzie estimates a US-made module with a US-made cell will be 42 per cent more expensive than a module from south-east Asia delivered in 2025.  “Why go through all the hassle of trying to secure capacity that doesn’t even exist right now?” asked Sylvia Leyva Martinez, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “From a purely economic perspective, it makes more sense to continue importing the module.” (Amanda Chu) Power Points How Iran will profit from Shell’s Iraqi gas project.Trees vs concrete: Madrid mayor accused of bucking green city trend.Carmakers’ latest Brexit angst highlights risk of UK falling behind EV battery race.

"Exonerated trader sues Deutsche Bank over Libor rigging allegations","Scandal forced some of the world’s largest financial institutions to pay billions in fines","A former Deutsche Bank trader whose conviction over the alleged rigging of the Libor interbank lending rate was overturned by a US appeals court has sued the German lender for $150mn, accusing it of deliberately framing him for the crimes of others. Matthew Connolly had been found guilty of fraud in 2018 in one of several high-profile cases brought by the US government over the Libor scandal that roiled the banking sector and forced some of the world’s largest financial institutions to pay billions of dollars in fines. But he and Deutsche Bank colleague Gavin Black had their convictions quashed on appeal in January, in a ruling that concluded “the government failed to show that any of the trader-influenced submissions were false, fraudulent, or misleading”.  In a suit filed in the Southern District Court of New York on Thursday, Connolly alleges that senior executives at the German group set him up as a “perfect fall guy” and that the lender provided false information to the Department of Justice to shield its higher ranks. Deutsche Bank convinced the government to “pursue, indict, scapegoat and prosecute Connolly”, who had not been employed by the lender for eight years prior to his indictment and “had virtually nothing to do with Libor”, wrote lawyers for the former head of the lender’s New York derivatives trading desk. The 27-page filing also cited remarks made by judge Colleen McMahon in Connolly’s original sentencing, calling him “the least culpable person”. “I’m always uncomfortable when I’m asked in any context — it usually happens in the drug context — to sentence the low man on the totem pole while the big guy goes free,” McMahon had said while handing down a sentence to Connolly of six months in home confinement and a $100,000 fine. Further remarks by McMahon were used by Connolly’s lawyers to argue that “the government outsourced the important developmental stage of its investigation to Deutsche Bank”, which had hired law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to conduct an internal probe in the wake of the Libor allegations. That investigation led to a $2.5bn settlement in which “no member of Deutsche Bank’s protected class of senior management was fined, prosecuted or deregistered”, even though their “role in the alleged Libor-rigging scheme was well known to the government”, the lawyers for Connolly allege. Connolly’s suit comes just a few weeks after a New York court threw out the criminal charges brought against former UBS and Citi trader Tom Hayes, along with another former trader, Roger Darin. British-born Hayes had already served a five-year prison sentence following a Libor conviction in the UK.

"Rio Tinto reluctantly hunts for deals as mining industry consolidates","Anglo-Australian group looking for critical mineral assets but says it needs to be disciplined","Rio Tinto is looking for opportunities to acquire critical mineral assets such as lithium and nickel, despite admitting it remains “reluctant” to pursue non-organic expansion. The A$171bn (US$117bn) miner told an investor day in Sydney on Thursday it was “location agnostic” regarding such assets but stressed it would remain disciplined in how it spends its money. Peter Cunningham, chief financial officer, told reporters on the sidelines of the conference: “On M&A we look, but we’ve got very, very strong discipline on what we do. At the end of the day, it’s got to be a fit with strategy. We’ve got to be the best operator of anything we buy and the value has to be there.”  BHP’s $6.4bn bid for Australian rival OZ Minerals is expected to usher in a wave of consolidation among the world’s largest miners, who can use huge cash flows generated by strong demand for minerals such as iron ore and copper to take over smaller rivals.  Rio Tinto discussed its own strategy at the investor day, following its $3.3bn buyout of Canada’s Turquoise Hill last week, which gave it greater control of the Mongolian copper mine Oyu Tolgoi. Jakob Stausholm, chief executive of the Anglo-Australian mining group, said he remained “a bit reluctant” to expand its business through big-ticket deals in markets such as copper. He said that miners could end up paying a “very full price” for assets that struggle to create value. Stausholm also argued that no other miner could match Rio Tinto, with its critical minerals assets in countries including Canada, Mongolia and Argentina, where it acquired the Rincon lithium mine for $825mn in March. Mining companies have been increasing their exposure to minerals such as copper, lithium and nickel, which countries need to decarbonise and open up alternative supply chains to China. Rio Tinto signed a memorandum of understanding with Ford this year that could result in the US carmaker becoming a foundation customer for the miner’s Argentine lithium supply.  “Critical minerals is clearly important from a policy perspective for many governments for security of supply,” said Cunningham.   Stausholm added the company still hoped it would be able to develop a $2.4bn lithium mine in the Jadar valley in Serbia. “The world needs it. Serbia needs it,” he said. “We haven’t given up.”  The Serbian government revoked Rio Tinto’s licence in January following protests over the social and environmental impact of mining lithium — a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries — and has not indicated it will backtrack on that move. The decision came at a time of heightened tension between Australia and Serbia over the deportation of tennis player Novak Djokovic in January. Rio Tinto said it had spent two decades working on Jadar but maintained that it respected the Serbian government’s position.  Rio Tinto is one of the biggest exporters of iron ore to China. A slowdown in construction in China had clouded the outlook of Australia’s biggest mining companies, but Simon Trott, head of iron ore at Rio, said there were signs of more stability in recent weeks. He added the outlook heading into 2023 was “constructive”. Lachlan Shaw, a mining analyst with UBS, downgraded his rating for Rio Tinto to “sell” this week, arguing that the miner’s dividend yield was not compelling enough for a cyclical stock with limited growth. He expected Rio to return around $7.5bn to shareholders in 2023, compared with $12bn annually during the previous four years — a reflection of lower commodity prices, higher capital expenditure and increased debt due to acquisitions including Rincon and Turquoise Hill.","15.12.2022"
"Credit Suisse chair says outflows have reversed since ‘social media storm’","Axel Lehmann expresses confidence that ‘money will come back over time’","The chair of Credit Suisse said clients had started to return to the bank after pulling tens of billions of dollars of assets following a “social media storm” at the start of October. Axel Lehmann said withdrawals had flattened across the group and had started to reverse in the Swiss domestic business, but the scale of the outflows had caught the Swiss lender off-guard. “It was a real storm,” said Lehmann at the Financial Times’ Global Banking Summit on Thursday. “It was a storm in the retail and partially in the wealth management segment, in particular in Asia, where we had really massive outflows for two to three weeks.   “The good part of the sad story is we had very few clients leaving. They are still with us, they still continue to do business with us.” He said clients had been taking up to a third of the assets they held with the bank and transferring them to rivals. “I have anecdotes from clients and I know that the money will certainly come back over time.”  Credit Suisse revealed last month that rich clients had withdrawn about SFr63.5bn ($67.4bn) since the start of October — equivalent to 10 per cent of wealth management assets — following a spate of social media rumours about its financial health. Spreads on the group’s credit default swaps surged in early October, which indicated investors were becoming increasingly bearish on the group, after a stream of rumours were posted on social media and web forums about the bank’s imminent collapse. Across the group, the bank bled SFr84bn in the fourth quarter, as private banking, asset management and retail clients moved money from their accounts to rivals. Credit Suisse said it expected a pre-tax loss of up to SFr1.5bn in the final three months of the year, its fourth profit warning since January.  The bank’s shares have tumbled to 30-year lows in recent weeks, falling to SFr2.70 on Thursday morning, 40 per cent lower than when the bank announced a radical restructuring in late October. The bank’s CDS also remain elevated at close to 450 basis points, compared with 350bp at the start of October, at the height of the social media furore. Lehmann was installed as chair in January, following the departure of his predecessor António Horta-Osório, who was found to have breached Covid-19 quarantine rules. Over the summer, Lehmann replaced Thomas Gottstein as chief executive with Ulrich Körner, who had previously run Credit Suisse’s asset management division. Lehmann and Körner, who worked as senior executives at UBS, have since set about devising a radical plan for Credit Suisse that will involve the bank cutting SFr2.5bn of costs, jettisoning 9,000 jobs and retreating from investment banking over the next three years. The bank has sought to raise SFr4bn to finance the transition by bringing in new investors such as the Saudi National Bank and through a rights issue, which is expected to be complete this month. On Thursday, Lehmann said the bank had “shielded” itself from “perceived conflicts of interest” when it decided that its then board member, Michael Klein, should lead the spun-off CS First Boston investment banking business.  Klein had led the board’s committee to devise a strategy for its investment banking business. Lehmann added that the company had several “offers on the table” from companies that were willing to back the new venture and was in discussions with the US Federal Reserve over its balance sheet, structure and governance.  Credit Suisse had previously said an unnamed investor had pledged $500mn.  Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","01.12.2022"
"Dealers expect discerning audience at Tefaf in tightening market for Old Masters","The supply of first-rank pictures is declining but prime works still find takers","Old Master dealers are bringing their most prestigious works to the 36th edition of Tefaf in Maastricht next week, reflecting how the Dutch fine art fair remains the pre-eminent place to gauge the state of the market. But perennial warnings about a tight supply of masterpieces and curious dynamics within the market show that not everything is smooth. Galerie Canesso of Paris is showing Guido Reni’s “Saint Jerome” (c1610, €1.3mn), a rediscovery described by gallery founder Maurizio Canesso as “a new addition to the oeuvre of this great Bolognese master”. Canesso adds: “We’re presenting it at Tefaf because that’s where this kind of picture meets the expectations of a highly demanding audience — both museums and private collectors — who are seeking such a work which is very rare on the market.” ‘The Adoration of the Magi’ (c1525-30) by Pieter Coecke van Aelst at Nicholas Hall  New York dealer Nicholas Hall says that Tefaf is the best showcase for a triptych depicting the adoration of the Magi (c1525-30, price undisclosed) by Pieter Coecke van Aelst, a leading exponent of the Antwerp Mannerist school, because of the calibre of collector who attends. “The underdrawing establishes that the master himself was directly involved in the production of this beautifully preserved panel,” Hall says.  The market for Old Masters — broadly covering the period from 1300 to 1800 — is seemingly in good health, buoyed by the avalanche of acclaim for the blockbuster Vermeer exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Dedicated January sales in New York delivered mixed results, but there were some healthy headline lots, including Bronzino’s “Portrait of a young man with a quill and a sheet of paper” (c1527), which fetched $10.7mn with fees at Sotheby’s. At Christie’s, dual portraits of a mother and daughter by Goya set an auction record for the Spanish painter, selling for $16.4mn with fees. There are red flags however. Writing in Apollo magazine, commentator Jane Morris says that experts periodically predict the “long, slow demise of the category”. Indeed, sector specialists say there is less “noise” today around Old Masters, which is perceived as a niche market. European Old Masters represented only 4 per cent of fine-art auction sales in 2021, according to the 2022 Art Basel/UBS Art Market report. Auction sales did rise by 65 per cent to $464mn, but that was driven by a few expensive lots and came off a 15-year low. Morris adds that “it is more accurate to say that the Old Masters market has remained the same while everything else around it has grown”, highlighting how the Old Master figures are often overshadowed by soaring postwar and contemporary results. Sotheby’s and Christie’s made £33mn and £13mn respectively in their evening Old Master sales last December in London; for comparison, a single lot in Christie’s 21st-century evening sale in New York last November, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s “Sugar Ray Robinson” (1982), sold for $32.7mn with fees. Andrea Ciaroni of Milan-based Altomani & Sons argues that the Old Masters market is a world apart from the contemporary art sector. “The former is not simply a niche market but a market of true connoisseurs and passionate buyers who appreciate the beauty and mastery of the art on display. In contrast, the contemporary art market is often driven by fashion, trends, and the desire to make investments.” Saint Jerome in two versions, one by Antonio Campi . . .   . . . the other by Abraham Janssen © Niels den Haan Altomani & Sons is showing at Tefaf pieces it hopes will “astound art enthusiasts”, says Ciaroni, referring to a pair of works depicting Saint Jerome. “Both paintings are signed and dated, with one by Antonio Campi, who was Caravaggio’s first master during his time in Milan. The other is by Abraham Janssen, a prominent Flemish artist who adopted Caravaggio’s innovative use of light.” Prices are undisclosed. Old Master dealers invariably highlight an enduring dilemma, however: the dearth of good material available. Ciaroni says that “it is indeed true that the availability of masterpieces in the art market is in a continuous state of rarefaction. This is due to the fact that over time many of these great works find their way into museums, thus leaving the market.”  Hall says there is undeniably a diminished supply of works by the most famous artists, though he adds that five paintings attributed to Botticelli have come to market in the past two years. (“Madonna of the Magnificat”, from the collection of the late Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, sold for $48.5mn with fees at Christie’s New York in November.) London dealer Charles Beddington says many great paintings still see the light every year. However, he stresses a curious attitude among collectors: “The lower the price range, the less demand there is.” At Tefaf he is offering “A View of Westminster Bridge” by Canaletto, which shows the Lord Mayor’s procession on the Thames on May 25 1750. “This is one of the most significant views of London in the 18th century ever likely to surface on the market,” he says. Yet it is only priced at €3.2mn. ‘A View of Westminster Bridge’ by Canaletto  There are silver linings nonetheless. “There is little demand for lower-price-range works at the moment,” says Carlo Milano of Callisto Fine Arts, London, “but don’t forget that there could be gems hiding there. Buy the good painting by the petits maîtres [less well-known masters], rather than a bad painting by a famous name.” If dealers want to tap into the “lower end”, they need to market their product thoughtfully at major events such as Tefaf, argues Hall. “The key is to put works at a range of prices alongside each other and to show that even the art on the lower end of the spectrum is authentic, well preserved and of real aesthetic and historic merit,” he says. So are there reasons to be cheerful about the Old Masters market? Davide Trevisani of Maurizio Nobile Fine Art gallery in Paris, another Tefaf participant, says a new generation of young art collectors is turning to Old Masters. “These include 30- to 35-year-old entrepreneurs from [tech] start-ups. There is a very interesting niche of new potential clients with spending power of up to €80,000 to €100,000 per purchase,” he says.  Milano also thinks new clients with eclectic taste may be the market cheerleaders in the future. “I think it is not time yet to pull the ready-made obituary for the Old Masters from the drawer.”  March 11-19, tefaf.com ","03.03.2023"
"The Lex Newsletter: European banking is having a time to shine","Italy’s lenders in particular are in their sweetest spot since before the financial crisis","This article is an on-site version of The Lex Newsletter. Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader, The City of London is a jaundiced vantage point from which to survey EU banks. Brexit has shifted the centre of gravity of European finance from the Square Mile to the middle of the English Channel. However, the bearishness of Lex’s London team on European banking predates Brexit. And it encompasses UK lenders in a spirit of equal opportunities pessimism. Strong results from European banks are posing a test for our lack of faith. The revival of net interest margins in parallel with rising interest rates kicks away one leg of our bearish thesis. This still has the following supports: high politicisation that impedes big payouts and prohibits cross-border mergers; small, fragmented local lending markets; the presence of price-insensitive lenders with public service missions, notably in Germany; and mature economies where tech innovation is disappointingly scarce.  These factors signpost longer-term international investment towards US retail lenders such as JPMorgan Chase and Truist. That leaves local European fund managers to revel in the recent revival of their bank holdings. Banks in Ireland and Spain were some of the most troubled during the financial crisis. They were the sector’s best performers last year. Bank of Ireland outperformed peers with gains of almost 80 per cent. CaixaBank and Sabadell in Spain rose by half.  Rising interest rates are one reason. Greater faith in local regulators is another. It has become harder for banks to operate with dangerously thin buffer capital. That has improved investor confidence.  If results from UniCredit this week are anything to go by, 2023 will be the year that Italian banks play catch-up. On Tuesday, chief executive Andrea Orcel unveiled a €5.2bn net profit for 2022. That is almost half as much again as the figure in 2021. As hinted at earlier in the month, shareholder returns will rise with plans to hand over €5.2bn this year, equal to 17 per cent of the market value. Shares rallied strongly on the day, moving close to five-year highs. Italy’s banks are now in their sweetest spot since before the financial crisis. A combination of rising interest rates, cleaner balance sheets and chunky excess capital underpin the equity story. Spreads on the country’s large sovereign debt pile remain contained after the panic last summer. Rising interest rates remain the force driving outperformance. UniCredit revenues were €1bn or a quarter higher than the fourth quarter of last year, and net interest income (NII) was 40 per cent higher. Further gains are expected with futures pricing in a European Central Bank deposit rate of more than 3 per cent for the summer.  Outside of a central bank rate cut, the biggest risk to NII is rising deposit rates or “deposit beta”. This reflects how fast-rising rates are passed on to depositors. As it stands, corporates are the businesses most exposed to the higher-rate environment.   Orcel has taken precautions in case deposit repricing heats up later in the year, doubling assumptions for deposit beta from 20 per cent to 40 per cent for this year.  Asset clean-ups across Europe over the past decade mean loan losses remain extremely low by historical standards. Even with a mild recession, a cost of risk — provisions as a share of total loans — of 35 basis points is expected at UniCredit this year, below past recessionary levels.  UniCredit’s capital returns support the valuation. Tangible book value rose 4 per cent in total last year. But on a per-share basis, it was almost 18 per cent higher. That is flattering a valuation that remains at a 37 per cent discount to tangible book value. Rival Intesa Sanpaolo continues to trade at close to par. UniCredit is making progress with a plan to return €16bn to shareholders by 2024. Spare capital for a deal seems very likely if 2023 performs in line with expectations. “The best stock in the European sector by far” is how Andrea Filtri of Mediobanca describes UniCredit. He began recommending shares at €10 last year.  Many investors in Italian banks will continue to prefer Intesa Sanpaolo. Italy’s largest bank is likely to deliver €1.7bn of promised buybacks. Its earnings are of higher quality. The lender has negotiated the minefield of Italian bank mergers cannily under chief executive Carlo Messina. Intesa’s all-share takeover of UBI Banca in 2020 delivered economies of scale and a capital boost via the accounting voodoo of negative goodwill. UniCredit deserves credit, meanwhile, for fending off attempts by Italy’s incestuous power elite to foist Monte dei Paschi di Siena — aka “the sick bank of Europe” — on to it at an unattractive price.  As a group, Italian banks have the problem — or virtue, if you favour geographic focus — that international exposure is relatively low. UniCredit has a sizeable European operation outside the borders of Italy. But Spain’s BBVA and Santander offer greater diversification. BBVA’s Mexican business is thriving, as results today signalled. What both BBVA and Santander need to demonstrate is that diversification can deliver better results than baskets of bank stocks from the markets where they operate.  Meanwhile, the only European bank stock on which Lex is a medium-term bull is UBS. And the Swiss giant is really more of an international wealth manager than a European retail lender these days.

"Fund managers: Amundi keeps Europe in the race for passive scale","The secular trend for scale in fund management is unstoppable","Size matters in fund management. The biggest investors, passive giants such as BlackRock, cater to the smallest, who are individual savers managing their nest eggs. The middle ground, which once yielded easy livings for active managers, has become a No Man’s Land. US leviathans BlackRock and Vanguard have turned the industry upside down over the past decade. Their low-cost, index-based investments are luring trillions of dollars. Smaller rivals have to go big, go home or go specialist to justify steeper fees. Amundi, which reported results this week, is one of the few able to go big. The asset management subsidiary of French bank Crédit Agricole managed €1.9tn (£1.68tn) of assets at the end of last year. That is €160bn less than at the end of 2021. Like most fund managers it has suffered from slumps in global stock markets.  Unlike many rivals, Amundi still managed to attract net new fund flows. These were €7bn for the year. Following in BlackRock’s footsteps, it is focusing on passive investments. These tend to be fixed baskets of stocks or bonds. The simplest are index trackers, following benchmarks such as the FTSE 100 or CAC40. Other funds have more complicated portfolios dictated by big data research. Shares in fund managers are bets on securities markets whose volatility reflects the operational gearing of the companies. When earnings and valuations rise, so do securities prices. That swells the income that fund managers receive from annual management fees. Those revenues fall when securities prices slip. To simplify: fund management shares are euphoric in a modest bull market and plunged into despair by the first hint of bearishness. Those ups and down are merely cyclical. Lex thinks the secular trend for scale in fund management is unstoppable. For this reason, we like huge fund businesses such as BlackRock and Amundi, wealth management titan UBS and some US alternative asset groups. We are also comfortable with such specialists as UK hedge fund group Man, which has some smart technology. We would avoid smaller UK generalists such as Jupiter and Abrdn. The latter is the disemvowelled result of the 2017 merger of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life.   The transaction has not been a great success. The business has lagged behind rivals such as Schroders and been a target for short sellers.  More happily, Amundi acquired Lyxor for €825mn in 2021 to become a market leader in European exchange traded funds, a passive investment structure that trades on stock markets. Amundi now has some €300bn of passive assets under management, which it hopes to grow to more than €400bn by 2025. Amundi reaps the benefits of banking relationships in distribution. In continental Europe, savings and investment products are still sold out of bank branches. That reach is also helping Amundi follow BlackRock into new revenue streams via technology sales. These grew 35 per cent last year to €48mn. BlackRock’s technology services division, known for its Aladdin platform, generated revenues of $1.4bn last year. Though majority-owned by Crédit Agricole, Amundi’s shares are listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. These have tracked stock markets lower over the past year. But crucially, returns have outperformed European peers by about 15 per cent over that time. That reflects strife in the industry as well as Amundi’s scale. BP chief executive changes his tune on renewables Bernard Looney claims he is “leaning in” on his renewables strategy. Lean too far, and a person can end up staggering. Energy prices soared last year. But the shares of UK-listed oil major BP trail behind those of US rivals ExxonMobil and Chevron. Both have invested far less in green energy.  Looney’s messaging when announcing record full-year profits on Tuesday reflected that pressure. When the chief executive took over in 2020 he boldly promised to reduce crude production by 23 per cent to 2mn barrels daily by 2025. He planned to invest heavily in the energy transition. Two years on, his determination to forswear fossil fuels is weaker. Record profits of £23bn last year were double what BP made in 2021 due to volatile oil and gas prices. The UK government is interested in a bigger slice via windfall taxes. BP’s effective tax rate already climbed two percentage points in the past year to 34 per cent, partly due to added levies. Exxon’s is closer to 26 per cent.  Oil and gas companies are operationally geared plays on hydrocarbon prices, in the same way that fund management shares amplify securities price movements (see above). But total shareholder returns, which include dividends, for BP — and Shell — are roughly half those of Exxon and Chevron over one year. This reflects shareholder unease over renewables investment as much as over windfall taxes. BP has increased the outlook of $16bn-$18bn for capital spending this year from a target of $14bn-$16bn back in 2020. Some of that increase comes from inflation. But oil production for 2025 would now fall only about 11 per cent from 2019 to 2.3mn barrels per day. Those volumes are needed, oil bulls say, to cover the west’s lost supply from Russia. BP’s oil price assumption for income from those added barrels has risen from $60 to $70. Higher forecast upstream profit helps pay for Looney’s renewables spending, an additional $8bn cumulative by 2030. Nearly half of this money goes to hydrogen and renewable power areas. Looney read the presentation room well, if not the mood of green campaigners perturbed by prevarication. The share price jumped 8 per cent on the day. The reality is that the marginal buyer of BP’s shares believes the energy transition will take longer, with scope for increased oil and gas output. BP is compromising in a bid to catch up with US peers.  Lex is the FT’s concise daily investment column.

"US investors balance ‘Fomo’ and geopolitics in China ","Chinese stocks have rallied sharply but the scars of recent experience run deep","There’s a long-running gripe among China-focused western bankers that the further an investor is from Beijing, the more negatively they view the Middle Kingdom. That has seldom been more true than today when despite a one-third rally in Chinese stock benchmarks in just three months, many western money managers, and Americans in particular, are still holding back.  The gains have prompted a flurry of upbeat China views from the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, with analysts noting depressed valuations and the potential for earnings growth as the world’s second-largest economy continues its re-emergence after almost three years of pandemic-induced isolation.  China’s bulls have some good points. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was trading in November on just six times forecast earnings and even now, at eight times, is only half its 2021 valuation peak. In contrast, the S&P 500’s collective price-earnings multiple of 18 is down a mere quarter. The Chinese economy is also expected to rebound in 2023 and vice-premier Liu He this week reassured Davos attendees about the country’s commitment to its capital markets.   And yet there is still wariness among international investors over the rally in indices such as the Hang Seng — long a proxy for western views on China — or MSCI’s China index, which mixes mainland stocks with shares trading in Hong Kong and New York. “Everyone has ‘Fomo’ — but they’re also scarred,” says Barry Gill, head of investments at UBS Asset Management in New York, referring to a fear of missing out. He is bullish on China’s prospects but concedes: “We’re not getting a lot of incoming interest yet.”  Even hedge funds aren’t immune. One Asia-focused manager reports continuing resistance to China investments from a big US backer, worried about Beijing’s different approach to the rule of law. Geopolitics has also introduced restrictions for Americans that, say, European funds don’t face. The Biden administration has amended and extended a Trump-era blacklist of Chinese companies deemed to have military ties that US investors cannot hold. Memorably, it added image-recognition specialist SenseTime to the list on the eve of its Hong Kong initial public offering just over a year ago, almost wrecking the deal, which eventually raised about $740mn    Audit issues brought up by Washington linger, too, after a 2020 US law that forces the delisting of companies from New York if regulators cannot review their audits for three years running. In December last year, the US accounting watchdog said it was satisfied with its access to Chinese auditors’ work — the first time it had received such co-operation from Beijing. But that only avoided a chaotic delisting of 200-plus Chinese stocks from New York in the near term. It did not end the threat. China has hardly helped investors. Its July 2020 imposition of a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong made front pages around the world and chilled debate in the financial hub. Then a series of regulatory crackdowns in 2021 pummelled investor confidence in sectors such as technology.   One probe crushed the hopes of ride-hailing company Didi by suspending downloads of its app just days after its $4.4bn IPO in New York. That followed investigations into tech titan Alibaba and associates including Ant Financial. Those effectively halted Ant’s record-shattering $35bn IPO in 2020 less than two days before trading was due to start. Any China believers still standing after all that have also had to contend with the impact of Beijing’s three years of Covid-19 isolation.  But investors have to look forward, not just contemplate their scars. Maintaining a negative stance on China is harder when its stocks are rallying and you think you’re missing out. China-wary investors benchmarked against emerging market indices are likely to struggle the hardest, given the country makes up almost a third of MSCI’s index for the asset class. And the situation in China does not need to be completely positive for stocks to rally.  “We don’t need everything in China to be improving, we might just need it not to be so bad any more,” says Dan Gerard, multi-asset strategist at State Street.  How long the holdouts will stand strong will also depend on the wider macro picture. Gerard thinks that markets are counting too much on western central banks cutting interest rates if economies weaken rapidly. If he’s right, China’s economic rebound post-Covid will probably look all the more tempting to investors seeking growth. There is a Wall Street market adage that fits the China scenario, about how a young trader is needed at the start of a bull run because they are fresh, and an old one as the rally ages because they can better spot looming pitfalls. It would certainly be easier to bet on China without the baggage of recent years but since that’s not possible, expect resistance to linger.  jennifer.hughes@ft.com","19.01.2023"
"First Republic threatens to be the SVB of Wall Street","Plus, the bankruptcy case threatening to escalate creditor-on-creditor conflict ","One thing to start: BBC directors have raised concerns that chair Richard Sharp’s position is becoming untenable after they were briefed on the investigation into his appointment, adding to pressure for his resignation as early as Friday. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter First Republic on the rocks Creditors square off over Serta Wall Street risks losing its own version of Silicon Valley Bank From Manhattan to Palm Beach and southern California, dealmakers favoured the same “if you know, you know” kind of lender to support the lifestyle of an up and coming Wall Streeter.  San Francisco-based First Republic was for many banking and private equity executives what Silicon Valley Bank was to the venture capital industry. The lender was a one-stop shop for cheap credit to finance everything from purchasing a stake in a private equity fund to a multimillion-dollar beach house. The leverage First Republic would offer individual partners committing to their newest fund was unmatched and its interest-only mortgages were the favoured financing option for chunky home purchases. “It was the fastest, best customer service and generally at a very good rate,” a financial executive told DD. Bloomberg recently had an excellent feature on the Wall Street executives such as Goldman Sachs president John Waldron who were customers of the bank. But First Republic’s days could be numbered as the decades it spent courting wealthy financiers threatens to become its undoing. The lender’s shares have fallen by 95 per cent this year as $100bn in deposits fled the bank, causing it to become the focus of regulators in Washington.  As First Republic spirals, there is a growing worry among dealmakers that they could soon lose their subsidy bank.  “Rich guy lending just changed dramatically,” a wealth management executive told DD. “Leading with cheap lending is over . . . Credit is tightening across the board. People are getting turned down for loans everywhere.”  The bank’s potential demise is in many ways similar to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the rescue of Credit Suisse. These banks courted the deposits of ultra-wealthy clients by offering generous lending terms. But their large deposits exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s insurance limits and were susceptible to flight. Worse yet, much of the deposits were invested in low-yielding assets such as agency mortgage bonds that had fallen in value as interest rates rose last year, threatening their solvency. If the fall of SVB taught us anything, our colleagues at the FT’s Unhedged write, it’s that the combination of uninsured deposits and low-yielding long-duration assets can be lethal. Which leads DD to the big question: what are First Republic’s options? First Republic advisers made some progress on Thursday to find a solution that might avert a full-scale bank resolution, according to multiple people briefed about the matter. This marks a shift in tone compared with Tuesday and Wednesday when its shares fell 65 per cent and fears grew that it was close to being taken over by the FDIC.  JPMorgan Chase, which has been acting as First Republic’s banker, is involved in the conversations and could come up with a solution that includes other large institutions — the same ones that have already infused the bank with $30bn in deposits. A private market solution, however, is likely to require a loss-share with the government given the size of First Republic’s bond losses. Any “open bank” plan will require the backing of the Biden administration, which according to other sources remains somewhat sceptical — as of Thursday evening — that a private-sector solution is viable. A collapse of First Republic is likely to cost large banks as fees paid to the FDIC rise, potentially making them willing to absorb some bond losses. For now, Wall Street’s biggest lenders, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup, have sat back and generally been the winners of the banking crisis. Since they are seen as too big to fail, deposits have flooded into these banks. The implicit government support has also calmed markets, giving policymakers the option to take a relatively hands-off approach to First Republic’s woes. The bankruptcy case dividing the leveraged loan market Lenders in the $1.4tn leveraged loan market — the lifeblood of the buyout industry — are asking themselves a somewhat unexpected question: will they be able to sit at the cool lunch table? It’s the latest wrinkle in the evolution of the market, traditionally a sedate corner of the financial system that helps fund private equity buyouts and the operations of relatively risky companies. The question has been sparked by a recent court decision in the Texas bankruptcy case of mattress maker Serta Simmons, which threatens to escalate creditor-on-creditor fighting, DD’s Eric Platt and Sujeet Indap and the FT’s Harriet Clarfelt report. While junior bond holders would often get into messy fights wrangling over their recoveries in restructurings, leveraged loan investors could usually watch from the sidelines. They were safeguarded by all the junior capital that ranked below them, there to absorb any losses in a default. But the Serta ruling blessed a controversial 2020 debt swap that only a slim majority of its senior lenders had approved. Other holders of the company’s loans, including Angelo Gordon and Apollo Global Management, were pushed further back in the queue to be repaid and the value of the loans they held crashed when Serta ultimately went bust. By confirming that the debt swap and refinancing package did not need unanimous support from all loan holders, Judge David Jones in effect opened the door to more deals that will pit lender against lender, industry veterans say. “It’s the tyranny of the majority taking advantage of the minority,” one restructuring adviser said. “If you’re in the 51 per cent in the right case . . . it can be very lucrative and it has created this dynamic of people competing. Do you get to sit at the cool lunch table or do you have to sit with the maths majors?” One distressed debt fund manager told the FT that aggressive investors such as his firm would benefit if other jurisdictions followed the Serta precedent. “This will completely throw the leveraged loan market into chaos,” he said. The loan market has changed since the financial crisis, and has become a much bigger part of the financing mix for leveraged buyouts over the past decade. But with that risk — and the loopholes in loan documents that lenders agreed to when times were hot — they are staring at a very different world. Moody’s estimates first-lien loan holders recovered about 95 cents on the dollar in restructurings from 1987 to 2019. That figure plunged to 73 cents in 2021 and 2022, with the rating agency warning that in this “new world of LBOs . . . even first-lien lenders will experience material impairment”. With bigger risk comes more incentive to pursue aggressive tactics, and the growth of private credit funds has also brought new players more comfortable with playing aggressively. One lawyer who has advised on a number of these transactions noted that “no one has smacked down a company or lender group for doing this type of transaction”. For now, the lawyer added, “no one is putting the brakes on [these] . . . deals”.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.Visit our Moral Money hub for all the latest ESG news, opinion and analysis from around the FT  This morning, the financial community woke up in a world where Credit Suisse has been snuffed out.  All financial institutions have good years and bad years. But what mattered to Credit Suisse was beating UBS. Now, to be acquired by your rival, it must be a big shock to those at both banks. It is a tectonic shift for Switzerland’s storied banking culture and, more broadly, for global finance. I will say, in my interactions with Credit Suisse’s people — especially in Washington — they were polite, friendly and willing to explain things. I would not say that about all the global banks.  In the US, which remains roiled in its own banking crisis, the focus is on regional banks and their ability to withstand the contagion from Silicon Valley Bank. Community banks play a big role in funding commercial real estate and if the banks pull back lending, how will that affect support for the Inflation Reduction Act? Will a credit squeeze now detail the IRA? This is a concern we will be following.  We would also like to highlight our colleagues’ report at the end of last week about the responses to the EU’s proposals to boost renewable manufacturing. European solar companies complained limits on Chinese imports could stymie their own production. At least one wind energy business said the measures won’t work until they are backed up with hard cash.

Volkswagen Group has committed to investing €20bn ($20.5bn) into its battery company  © Bloomberg In the debt markets, green sells. Bonds with sustainability labels of any kind outperformed “vanilla” equivalents in the second half of last year, according to new research, adding to evidence this type of debt can nudge up returns for fixed income funds. Analysis of 72 euro and dollar-denominated corporate bonds by the non-profit Climate Bonds Initiative found every flavour of sustainable debt outperformed other debt issued by the same companies in the second half of last year. This included so-called sustainability-linked bonds, which penalise issuers who fail to meet certain environmental and social goals, and more traditional “use-of-proceeds” bonds which earmark cash raised for projects such as solar panels or assisted housing.    “Thematic bonds have issuers and investors head over heels for one another,” said Sean Kidney, CBI’s chief executive. “In a crucial decade for climate action, the sustainable bond market is the goose that laid the golden egg.” Debt with a green label had the highest boost, known as a “greenium”: yields averaged close to half a percentage point lower compared with equivalent bonds, according to the CBI. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) This means companies raised their money more cheaply than they otherwise would have done.  It also found evidence of higher price rises in secondary markets in the month following issuance, which would have benefited investors.   German government bonds are often used to illustrate the pricing benefits of green bonds, as the country issues green and non-green debt simultaneously in an easy-to-compare “twin” structure. The average yield on a €5bn German government issuance with a green tag was 1.25 basis points lower than its plain equivalent last August, the CBI said.  However, critics point out that in the absence of strong regulatory scrutiny, any issuer can decide to add a green tag to a bond, albeit not without controversy in the case of big polluters like airlines or oil majors. It must simply promise to spend the money it raises on projects with biodiversity or climate benefits. As bond markets tanked around the world last year and retail awareness of the potential for greenwashing grew, issuances in the sustainable bond market fell for the first time ever, from $1.1tn in 2021 to $863bn in 2022, according to Bloomberg data.  Even so, several investors told the CBI they would not have bought some bonds if it were not for the green label attached, including those issued by car companies Renault and Volkswagen. (Kenza Bryan) Questions about climate risk abound under new BoJ leadership After Haruhiko Kuroda led the Bank of Japan through 10 years of “unprecedented” monetary easing, Kazuo Ueda is set to become the next Bank of Japan governor on April 9.  The first task Ueda will face will be to normalise Kuroda’s ultra-loose monetary policy — without causing huge side-effects on the world’s third-largest economy. But ESG-conscious investors might have another question: how will Ueda handle Kuroda’s climate change legacy? Kuroda made clear his belief that helping society tackle climate change is within the central bank’s mandate. Under his watch, the BoJ launched a scheme that offered zero-interest loans to banks to boost green and transition finance. Ueda, who will become the first BoJ chief from academia in postwar Japan, has made very few comments on the topic of using monetary policy to respond to the risks of climate change. A rare example is Nikkei’s article published in December 2021 (available here for any Japanese-speaking readers.)  In the article, Ueda argued that while central banks can address the risks of climate change, the action should be temporal and proceed with extra care. Guiding markets and societies to decarbonise is more of a job for fiscal authorities, as the central banks don’t have enough tools to do so, he added. He also said that establishing carbon tax and carbon pricing schemes, which he believed would trigger innovations in the field of clean energy, is more of “a natural way” to achieve a net zero society than interventions by central banks. If businesses cannot raise enough money for green transformation and need public support, “financial institutions which are close to the governments” — rather than the central banks — should step in, he wrote. His scepticism towards the central bank’s role in mitigating climate change shows a stark contrast from a former candidate to lead the BoJ. Masayoshi Amamiya, a BoJ veteran whom Nikkei reported had been approached as a possible successor to Kuroda, believed that responding to climate change was an important part of the BoJ’s mandate. With Ueda’s apparent reluctance to deepening the central bank’s involvement in the fight against climate change, many BoJ watchers don’t expect further commitments in this area.  But on the other hand, very few expect Ueda will introduce drastic changes compared with his predecessor. As Fumio Kishida’s administration sets green transformation as one of its top priorities, it’s unlikely that Ueda will unwind Kuroda’s initiatives, said Satoru Kado, principal economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.

"French banks set to lose out on rising rates due to loan repricing rules","Bumper profits expected across Europe but local conditions in France are limiting its lenders ","French banks risk falling behind European rivals and losing out on windfall profits from rising interest rates due to rules which hamstring their ability to reprice loans. After a decade of depressed returns, rising inflation and ECB rate hikes have radically changed the fortunes of most of Europe’s biggest banks, driving up margins and lending income. With the exception of Credit Suisse, bumper profits are expected of Europe’s top banks when they report fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks. Italy’s UniCredit and Switzerland’s UBS kick off the season on Tuesday.   But not all banks will have benefited equally from the interest rate windfall — a disparity that is set to deepen in the short term. France’s lenders are suffering from the most significant setbacks.  The performances of banks like BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and BPCE are being curtailed by a mortgage market geared towards fixed-rate loans and a 200-year-old savings account designed to help restore France’s public finances after Napoleon Bonaparte’s wars. Still popular today, rates on the widely used Livret A deposit accounts are linked to inflation and set by the government. They have now reached their highest level in 14 years at 3 per cent, and are set to increase further this year.  The accounts squeeze banks’ margins by forcing them to pay out more to depositors, while limiting the benefit they get from rising rates on their loans portfolio. These pressures are creating a two-speed European banking sector just as it starts generating interest from investors, including US ones.   “Higher interest rates are definitely the main driver of the European bank sector,” said Credit Suisse banking analyst Jon Peace. “For French banks, the earnings upgrades have so far lagged the broader industry.” Prospects for the industry in Europe have improved since the beginning of 2023, especially as concerns over recessions begin to fade, including in major economies such as Germany. Economists from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have recently reversed their expectations for a contraction in eurozone output in the first quarter.  That in turn could lessen the need for banks to notch up large charges to cope with the risk of defaults, after they began to cut provisions last year as the hit from the coronavirus lockdowns of 2020 faded.  “The drop in [European] gas prices has suddenly eased fears about any recessions to come,” said Jefferies analyst Flora Bocahut. “For banks, the big debate was that everyone knew that they would benefit from interest rate rises, but it wasn’t clear how much of that would be offset by the recessions that were expected and a rise in provisions.” The French banks will be able to offset some of the pain in their home market with business elsewhere, or in other divisions such as asset management, investment banking and car leasing.   But their French net interest income and margins — or the difference between what banks pay out to depositors and what they earn from borrowers — are coming under growing pressure, with the hit set to last until at least the second quarter of 2023, when the ECB is expected to start easing off its rate hikes.   “2023 will still be a difficult year, but all the indicators will be back to positive in 2024,” said one senior French banking executive.  In addition to their exposure to fixed-rate home loans, and unlike most other lenders in Europe, French banks are also constrained by a limit, set by the central bank, on the amount lenders can charge for mortgages.  By November, French average mortgage rates of 1.91 per cent were the lowest in the eurozone, ECB data showed, with the average in the bloc already at 2.88 per cent.  Société Générale, France’s third-biggest listed lender, is the most exposed to these pressures, with French net interest income accounting for about 15 per cent of its overall revenues, according to Jefferies. That compares to 9 per cent at larger peers Crédit Agricole and 7 per cent at BNP Paribas, the least geared towards household loans.  BNP said in November it expected an extra €2bn of revenues by 2025 from rising interest rates once the benefits kick in. The bank, which has a strong presence in Italy and Belgium among other European countries and a large corporate and investment bank, is expected to perform better in the fourth quarter than its French rivals, Credit Suisse’s Peace said.  Two of Spain’s midsized banks, Sabadell and Bankinter, have already given a glimpse of the upswing expected elsewhere in the shorter term, with surges of 25 and 47 per cent, respectively, in their net interest income in the fourth quarter.  Bankinter’s results were overshadowed, however, by higher-than-expected costs, in one reminder of other residual risks, including inflation pushing up salaries and other expenses.  Investors had remained largely cautious on the sector in 2022 — despite an uptick in profits, and the promise of large returns to investors through dividends and share buybacks — and some of the pressures from a simmering energy crisis in Europe remain a potential deterrent.  “The rate rises are an enormous change, a gift from heaven that had been awaited for a long time,” said Jérôme Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments. “But there are still macroeconomic headwinds. Banks remain banks, they’re more cyclical than companies in other sectors.”","29.01.2023"

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: JPMorgan’s dealmaking under scrutinyHollywood’s concierge goes after GoldmanPrivate equity gets into PR Does JPMorgan have a shopping problem? Jamie Dimon cemented his position as one of Wall Street’s most ruthless dealmakers more than a decade ago, when the JPMorgan Chase boss scooped up Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual from the rubble of the financial crisis.  But US regulators are scrutinising whether the bank has moved too quickly in a recent spree of far less notable deals. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, has scheduled an audit of JPMorgan’s due diligence on a series of acquisitions in 2021 and 2022, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times’ Joshua Franklin. One of them is the bank’s $175mn deal with student financial aid start-up Frank, which, as DD detailed yesterday, swiftly backfired after an internal investigation by JPMorgan uncovered what authorities now allege was a months-long scheme to fabricate data.  Prosecutors allege in court filings that the fintech start-up’s founder, Charlie Javice, repeatedly misled JPMorgan by paying a data science professor to manufacture the information required to close the deal and paying $105,000 for a list of millions of students. Javice was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit bank, wire and securities fraud this week, four months after JPMorgan filed a civil suit alleging that the 31-year-old entrepreneur inflated its number of users from 300,000 to 4.25mn. Lawyers for Javice didn’t respond to requests for comment. She denied the bank’s allegations of falsifying accounts in a countersuit against JPMorgan. The Frank acquisition, which Dimon later described as a “huge mistake”, has been one of the bank’s many quick-fire deals in recent years.  JPMorgan made 80 purchases and strategic investments in 2021 and 2022, according to Dealogic data, with activity in technology-oriented deals leaping dramatically after Dimon said in January 2021 that the bank “should be scared shitless” about emerging tech disrupters. Given the carnage that has followed — from a global tech sell-off to the unravelling of Silicon Valley’s go-to lender — it’s possible that Dimon’s fears may have been misplaced. How the OCC’s audit plays out is yet to be seen. But there may be a subtle upside for JPMorgan and its shareholders.  Mega banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and UBS have completed or attempted big-ticket technology acquisitions to keep ahead of perceived threats. Regulators, however, could force new discipline on the spending by nudging banks to focus on their existing businesses, instead of costly acquisitions like Frank. Hollywood’s celebrity concierge has a bone to pick with Goldman Sachs If you’re the Queen of Pop or an A-list actor, chances are you don’t handle your own chores. “My people will talk to your people,” you might be wont to promise, over the din of clacking cameras and screaming fans.   In today’s Hollywood, there’s a good chance that your people — or some of them — are employed by Mickey Segal, a celebrity business manager who made his fortune lubricating rich people’s lives. Buying a new car? No need to show up at a dealership. Looking to hire a chef, or a nanny? The interviews are handled for you. Segal, whose clients have included superstars like Drake and Madonna, is rich enough himself these days that he’s a client of Goldman Sachs. His celebrity concierge firm, NKSFB, hired the investment bank last year to explore a sale of the business.  Segal met with more than a dozen would-be bidders. At one meeting, held in December, Segal sought to impress executives from KKR with a client roster that included entertainers who had played the half-time show in 13 of the past 15 Super Bowls. But now Segal is suing Goldman, alleging that the bank tricked him into handing over business secrets as part of an effort to agree a $7bn deal with a private equity group. NKSFB counts celebrities including Madonna among its clients © Getty Images The lawsuit focuses on Goldman’s role when Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the New York-based buyout group, purchased Focus Financial Partners, a listed wealth management company that bought a majority economic stake in NKSFB in 2018. Segal accuses Goldman of “secretly dealing behind [his] back” by “shop[ping] around” a proposed sale of the larger company as well. DD’s Mark Vandevelde has all the details on this messy dispute, which reveals how the lives and business affairs of top-flight entertainers have created lucrative opportunities for money managers and fixers operating in rarefied circles where discretion is highly prized. Focus complains that Segal is threatening to disrupt its go-private in an effort to juice his own economics, and says his lawsuit is meritless. Goldman said it had acted fairly and honestly and “had every incentive to achieve the best outcomes for both our clients”, contrary to Segal’s claims. Private equity takes PR for a spin The typical image of Wall Street public relations groups belongs to a bygone era: whole organisations built around big personalities, whose names carry just as much cache as their clients and can seal the deal with a flick of their flip phone. But times have changed. KKR’s latest play to buy a large stake in FGS Global, which will value the WPP-backed communications group at about $1.4bn, reflects private capital’s tightening grip on the once independent market, DD’s Arash Massoudi and Ivan Levingston revealed this week. The industry is now defined by consolidation and large, global organisations. Finsbury, Glover Park Group and Hering Schuppener — all of which are controlled by WPP — merged in 2020 to form Finsbury Glover Hering, which bought Wall Street whisperer Sard Verbinnen the following year to form FGS. KKR, which is expected to acquire more than 30 per cent of FGS from senior employees at FGS and from WPP, follows private equity rivals into the sector including CVC, which controls Teneo, and BDT Capital Partners, which invested in PR shop Brunswick in 2021. The deal is a win for FGS flacks, as Lex notes: FGS partners can monetise a large slice of their equity at a high valuation, about 15 times 2023 ebitda, while the firm will access KKR’s steady deal flow. The more recent travails of Teneo, which several years ago had to enlist its own services following alleged drunken misconduct by its founder Declan Kelly, suggest that moulding an investment around gifted spin-doctors can sometimes backfire.  Job moves Shearman & Sterling has elected its New York-based co-global managing partner and head of disputes Adam Hakki as senior partner, succeeding David Beveridge.

"Chamath Palihapitiya learns there’s no such thing as free money","Plus, the Hollywood rise of Ari Emanuel and venture capital dries up in Silicon Valley","One big scoop to start: Private equity group KKR is nearing a deal to buy a large stake in FGS Global that will value the WPP-backed financial communications firm at about $1.4bn, said people with knowledge of the matter.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Chamath learns his lessonAri Emanuel’s Hollywood storyVenture capital in the doldrums The price of being a Spac king Chamath Palihapitiya, an investor who a couple of years ago compared himself to Warren Buffett, recently made an astonishing discovery: there’s no such thing as free money.   It was a hard lesson to learn for the Social Capital founder. He wrote in his annual letter to investors that “a small line of credit that we used to drive incremental returns . . . quickly ballooned as some of the assets we used to collateralize it saw up to a 70 [per cent] reduction in price.”  There’s a much shorter way of putting this, of course, but we admire Palihapitiya’s creativity.  Chamath Palihapitiya © Bloomberg “What initially seemed like access to free money became a liability that we managed carefully,” he went on. It seems Palihapitiya, who made his name churning out special purpose acquisition companies like they were going out of style (and they did), was required to put up more collateral for the loan.  The Financial Times reported last year that Palihapitiya had borrowed money from Credit Suisse to finance $200mn of his initial share purchases in two signature blank-cheque deals, and pledged his stock in the companies as collateral.  Much of Palihapitiya’s letter was dedicated to how the end of zero-interest rate policy, or ZIRP as he took to calling it (which could easily be a ticker for one of his Spacs), had hit some of his most-beloved sectors — cryptocurrencies, software as a service, Spacs and biotech.  The gist of it is that companies now need to focus on turning a profit rather than pursuing growth at all costs.   The irony isn’t lost on anyone. Many of the companies that Palihapitiya and his cohort of Spac sponsors took public were early-stage businesses that sometimes didn’t even have a product, let alone any profit. Much of this, at least in the Spac heyday, was done with little risk to the backers who got outsize benefits for launching the vehicles if they completed a deal.  That’s why Palihapitiya often waxed lyrical about how Spac sponsors need to have skin in the game. So when he was approached by the FT in 2020 to ask if he had borrowed money to finance his $100mn investment in Virgin Galactic, Palihapitiya denied it with an emphatic: “That is NOT correct.” It turns out VG was one of the deals for which he had borrowed money from CS. Palihapitiya sold much of his personal stake in the company, which he acquired for a nominal sum when he launched the Spac, for hundreds of millions of dollars in March 2021 when prices were ranging between $31.86 to $38.00. Today, Virgin Galactic’s share price is just above $3.  It isn’t hard to see why Palihapitiya thought there was such a thing as free money.  Hollywood’s most aggressive dealmaker defends his title Back in the early aughts, Ari Emanuel’s relentless ambition and hot temper was so notorious around Hollywood that it inspired the lead character in HBO’s Entourage. More than a decade after the show’s final episode, however, the fictional Ari Gold is just a foul-mouthed minnow compared to his modern-day counterpart.   Through aggressive deals, Emanuel has transformed his talent empire Endeavor, which began above a Beverly Hills hamburger restaurant in 1995, into an industry heavyweight that boasts clients such as Oprah Winfrey and Martin Scorsese. The talent agent turned master dealmaker’s latest play, acquiring World Wrestling Entertainment from founder Vince McMahon and combining it with the mixed martial arts business Ultimate Fighting Championship to create a $21bn juggernaut, has reinforced his chokehold over the entertainment business. Ari Emanuel said of the WWE deal: ‘It’s very rare, when a global iconic brand becomes available. And when it does, you have to say yes’ © REUTERS It also underscores the risk Emanuel is willing to take to stay on top. McMahon, who abruptly retired from the business following allegations of secret payments to female employees and sexual misconduct, is a controversial figure, as DD detailed earlier this week. In a plot twist fit for scripted wrestling, the 77-year-old re-entered the ring in January, installing himself as executive chair. He will also stay on to chair the yet-to-be-named group that Emanuel has dubbed “Endeavor 2.0”. From writing an FT op-ed calling out Kanye West for antisemitic comments to returning $400mn to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund following the killing of Jamal Khashoggi (though he’s now back in business with the kingdom because of WWE’s 10-year deal with Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority), Emanuel has always spoken his mind. So when asked by the FT if he had any concerns about partnering with McMahon, Emanuel said: “Not one.” “Take all the craziness away . . . I believe in due process. There was an investigation. There was no wrongdoing found,” he said. “So we move on.” A good wrestling match is nothing without a little controversy, after all. Dark clouds linger over Silicon Valley Start-ups can’t catch a break. After their main lender Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month, this week brings news that venture capital funding has halved in the last year, DD’s George Hammond and Tabby Kinder report.  According to Crunchbase, venture funds invested $76bn in the first three months of this year, down from $162bn a year earlier. Even that lower figure gives an overly optimistic impression, inflated as it is by payment group Stripe’s $6.5bn fundraise last month and artificial intelligence company OpenAI’s $10bn investment, led by Microsoft in January.   Strip out those blockbuster transactions and it’s a grim picture for cash-hungry start-ups, many of which are now expected to go to the wall in a much harsher funding environment. SVB’s failure is an added complication: the bank was a big lender of venture debt, which start-ups used to buy time between equity rounds.  “Even before SVB [collapsed] this was the worst business environment anyone had seen,” says Sam Yagan, the founder of dating website OkCupid and early-stage company investor. “We were telling people you can’t assume there will be more capital waiting for you.

"The Lex Newsletter: fear and loathing in California, Zurich and a bank branch near you","SVB, HSBC, Credit Suisse, First Republic, UK Budget, UK pensions, Porsche","Lex: a sum of the pars exercisePlease tell the FT’s flagship investment column what its priorities should be for its next 90 years by participating in our readership survey.  This article is an on-site version of The Lex Newsletter. Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday Dear reader, If you have ever wondered what a banking crisis is, look around. In the past fortnight, Silicon Valley Bank and two other specialist US lenders have collapsed. And the Swiss National Bank and Wall Street have propped up Credit Suisse and First Republic with liquidity and deposits.  Other institutions will need rescuing before the dust settles. Savvy acquirers will pick up some attractive assets on the cheap. The pace of interest rate rises will slow, regardless of what central bankers and economic pundits say at present. The net interest margins of banks will widen less than expected. US regional banks will incur tighter regulation.  During recent suckers’ rallies in the US market, Lex predicted further bumps, stumbles and left-field challenges before big economies adjusted to higher rates. We had not expected anything as bad as this. Amid such technicalities as hold-to-maturity bond hedging, it is easy to forget the basic flaw of the banking industry. It depends for its survival on trust outweighing fear in the minds of depositors. They can pull their funds at will. The bank cannot realise its loans quickly. Mass withdrawals — or the threat of them — can easily topple a lender Runs represent the triumph of terrified individualism over placid mutuality. It may be personally rational to pull uninsured deposits before your bank’s immediate liquidity is exhausted. It is collectively irrational to destroy an institution that benefits everyone. Financial analysis can be a false friend in such circumstances, a problem the Lex team has been acutely aware of this week. Banks are relatively strong by historic standards. That strength can be complacently quantified. Financial panic is unquantifiable and therefore easy to downplay. But it can still overwhelm solvent financial institutions by making them illiquid. A timeline of Lex notes is the easiest way to tell the extraordinary story of the past week. For convenience, I’ll identify these by the UK date of online publication, in priority over the timing of the local event they describe. Friday March 10: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapses following a run by its depositors. Lex notes that unrealised losses on bond holdings are a widespread vulnerability of US banks. SVB’s concentrated base of depositors — mostly high-tech start-ups — is a narrower problem. We point to the danger of contagion to First Republic and PacWest.  Sunday March 12: US financial authorities mount an auction of SVB assets. Unsurprisingly, this proves abortive. The collapse will, however, create opportunities for tech giants and venture capitalists to buy distressed start-ups. Monday March 13: HSBC shows opportunism of its own by buying the UK subsidiary of SVB for £1. This looks like a good deal. It allows boss Noel Quinn to onboard entrepreneurial customers, a group he favours. It should buy him some UK political kudos, supposing politicians are capable of gratitude. The asset base of SVB UK is usefully diverse. The original sin of the parent was the concentration of asset risk via a portfolio of dull, long-dated US municipal bonds whose value was trashed by interest rate rises. Bond maths is the new Nemesis of banks. By Monday, US regulators had guaranteed all the deposits of SVB and Signature Bank, which had also collapsed. The Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase contributed $70bn of backstop liquidity to First Republic Bank. This lender has some similarities to SVB. The intervention failed to arrest a share price slump. “Fear can easily chase rational thought from the market,” Lex wrote. Tuesday March 14: Bank shares tumbled in Tokyo. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group registered a 17 per cent drop from the moment SVB cratered. Lex reckoned the weakness of Japanese banks reflected high exposure to US bonds and fears that the Bank of Japan would now continue to keep rates low.  Shares in US regional banks made a modest recovery when New York opened. First Republic, PacWest, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorp and UMB Financial were among them. A drop the day before channelled fears of instability. This is partly the result of a 2018 bank relief law that raised the threshold for US financial institutions to qualify as systemically important — and suffer stricter regulation — from $50bn to $250bn in assets. Most US regional banks limbo under that bar. Wednesday March 15: A full-blown crisis erupted at Credit Suisse, the weakest of Europe’s big banks after its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, dismissed suggestions it should inject fresh equity. Amid the panic, Credit Suisse was trapped in a three-way doom loop between depositors pulling money, rising bond default insurance prices and falling shares, which dropped as much as 30 per cent intraday.   The fact that the bank appealed to the Swiss National Bank for support strongly suggests large commercial banks were increasingly unwilling to transact with it, despite a 150 per cent liquidity coverage ratio. Thursday March 16: Overnight, the SNB put up SFr50bn ($54bn) in extra liquidity. Credit Suisse swiftly mounted a SFr3bn senior bond repurchase. That highlighted the securities as a fourth element in the doom loop. Notional yields of these supposedly high-grade instruments had risen as high as 150 per cent. The Swiss bank insisted it would continue with a complex restructuring. But circumstances have changed. A simpler streamlining, perhaps involving UBS, is required. Happy days — for the moment — for US alternative asset managers such as Blackstone and Apollo. Their growing private credit funds have long lock-ins, which protect them from depositor runs. And the scale of their resources for their old métier of buyouts now allows them to do deals primarily in equity, albeit that returns may be less. Friday March 17: A deposit injection of $30bn into First Republic by JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others was an intelligent attempt to calm market panic, we reckoned. But it impressed Lex more than the market — the stock had dropped another 23 per cent by lunchtime in New York.  It is increasingly likely that First Republic will, at the least, need an open-ended promise of liquidity support from the Fed. And that may simply prompt Armageddon to move on somewhere else.  Contagion is raging like a forest fire. When the financial authorities douse it in one place, it soon flares up somewhere else. Non-apocalyptic news This has been a decent week for high-earning British executives, some of whom are readers of this column. The government introduced a three-year, 100 per cent tax deduction for business investment in its annual Budget. It also abolished the cap on tax-free pension saving, though an incoming Labour government would reinstate it unless you are a doctor. Lex last week saluted increased scope for final salary pension scheme buyout deals, though this was before the banking crisis made steady rate rises less likely. The buyouts simplify corporate cash flow and improve the covenant of scheme members and pensioners. Soon all those wealthy oldies may be bombing around the countryside in Porsches purchased with the chancellor’s largesse. The German sports-car maker is doing nicely. We think its valuation niche will inevitably sit below Ferrari and above VW.  Things I have enjoyed this week I am still reading Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.  I also enjoyed the FT’s Helen Thomas ticking off the UK’s fickle tech entrepreneurs. One of my children made the mistake of expressing an interest in the life of Charles Darwin. We are therefore watching an old BBC TV drama on that subject. It is long, slow-paced and very calming. I recommend boring 1970s TV to anyone who is finding the semi-collapse of western banking a little too stressful.

"Battle of the chatbots: how does GPT-4 stack up against Bard?","We ask the generative AI systems from OpenAI and Google to pick stocks, tell jokes and imagine the Xi-Putin summit","Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google have both released artificial intelligence-based chatbots in recent weeks. Their respective conversational engines — ChatGPT Plus and Bard — differ in the way they respond to complex queries, ingest text and come up with creative answers.  The chatbots are trained to generate their responses using written data from the internet, like the millions of words written on websites including Wikipedia, books and other documents, to predict the likely next word in a sentence. This allows them to give uncannily plausible responses that mimic human speech.  OpenAI and Google have been opaque about how their models were built. However, it is likely their training data and objectives are distinct.   Bard is trained specifically to engage in natural-sounding dialogue, while the objective of GPT-4 is to generate in-depth replies on a broad range of topics. GPT-4 is also disconnected from the internet and only has knowledge of events until September 2021. Bard can ostensibly bring results from Google search, although that does not seem to enhance the quality of its responses.  We wanted to test the ability of chatbots further, engaging them on tasks that approximate creativity, flair and imagination. Here are the results — and how the Financial Times’ human experts rated them.   Summarising an FT analysis We asked the chatbots to summarise the FT’s recent analysis of the sale of Swiss bank Credit Suisse to its arch rival UBS. ChatGPT-4 responded with:  Bard did not allow us to input the entire story at once, so was at a natural disadvantage. This was its summary by taking in text from the first half of the FT story.  Owen Walker, European banking correspondent, writes:  That’s a pretty impressive overview [by GPT-4]. The only error in there is that it should be $5tn in assets “under management” — but that wasn’t clear from the original piece, so it’s excusable.  Bard’s response, while accurate, seems more formulaic and stilted than the first one. There is also a repetition of the introductory paragraph as the summary.   Can AI pick the next stock market winner? We fed the two chatbots the rules of the FT’s annual stockpicking contest. Contestants must choose five stocks from around the world and take either a long or short position — betting that the shares will either rise or fall. The winner is the person who generates the highest overall return on their portfolio. We asked the bots to predict for 2023, but GPT-4 said it had a knowledge cut-off of September 2021, while Bard’s cut-off is unknown. Here is how they did.   Chosen by ChatGPT-4TeslaAmazonNvidiaMicrosoftModernaChosen by BardTeslaAppleMicrosoftAlphabetAmazon Robin Wigglesworth, Alphaville editor, writes:  Both GPT-4 and Bard picked pretty similar portfolios: largely blue-chip technology stocks that had already mostly done well by September 2021 — exhibiting a very human tendency to jump on winners.  Both picked Tesla, Amazon and Microsoft. Bard betrayed a home bias by choosing its maker Alphabet in addition to Apple, while GPT-4 revealed itself as a momentum jockey by picking sizzling hot Nvidia and Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna.  The headline results — a 74.4 per cent return in 2021 for GPT-4 and 40.5 per cent for Bard — therefore look good. But if we just look at the results from when they were picked and the end of the year, their gains fall to 16.3 per cent and 21.1 per cent, respectively.  This may still look respectable, but generative AI’s inclination to jump into trendy tech stocks would have punished it when interest rates began to rise in 2022. ChatGPT-4 and Bard’s portfolios both lost over 40 per cent last year. The S&P 500 index only lost 19.4 per cent.   Can AI tell a joke? We asked both chatbots to tell us a joke — and then why it was funny. We picked what we thought would be a hard subject to joke about. You can judge the results here for yourself.   Firstly, ChatGPT’s effort:  Next, Bard:   Can AI imagine a conversation? We wanted to test how the chatbots do on tasks that would require creative thinking in humans. So we asked GPT-4 and Bard to conduct an imagined conversation between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin during a state visit. Here is an excerpt of what GPT-4 had to say:   And here is an excerpt of Bard’s take:   Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator, writes:  I’m sure that much of what Putin and Xi say to each other are empty pleasantries. But it defies credulity to believe that their conversations are quite this bland and content-free.  These are two leaders with vital issues to discuss. ChatGPT and Google Bard seem to believe that they will follow the Basil Fawlty guide to diplomacy — “Don’t mention the war.” That is obviously ridiculous. The Ukraine war will have been the central topic of their conversation in Moscow. The interesting question is how frank their discussion would be. I suspect — probably they would be fairly vague with each other. But it’s possible the conversation could get very blunt indeed.  Here is my guess of how the conversation might go: Xi — I would be interested in your view of how the war is going and how you see it coming to an end. Putin — I understand your concern. We remain determined to free Ukraine of fascism and to defeat American interference in our region. The problems of our forces are related to the enormous amount of weaponry that the US and Nato have poured into Ukraine. It would frankly help us a great deal if China could supply us with missiles and other ammunition that is vital to our struggle. Xi — I understand your request and will consider it very carefully. But this is a situation of extreme sensitivity, as you will understand. I think we should delegate our officials to consider areas where we might be able to co-operate.  China is also keen to play a part in the peace process for Ukraine. What can we do to help there? Putin — We greatly appreciate the Chinese peace plan. But we feel the time is not yet ripe for you to speak to Zelenskyy.  If ChatGPT or GoogleBard were up to their jobs, that is the kind of thing they might have come up with. At present, I am not worried for the careers of the world’s diplomats.  Can AI write an advertising slogan? We asked each chatbot to come up with a new slogan for an imagined gourmet dog desserts company. Here are their attempts. We also used the two responses to generate relevant imagery, using text-to-image AI software Midjourney.  Image generated from Midjourney prompt: “website design, splash page, UX, “Indulge Your Pooch: Delightful Desserts for Distinguished Dogs”, bright colours, — ar 16:9  — v5” Image generated from Midjourney prompt: “website design, splash page, UX, “Delicious dog desserts that will make your pup beg for more”, bright colours, — ar 16:9  — vs 5”  Harry Haydon, brand strategist, FT, writes: If this was a pitch between two ad agencies, GPT-4 would be heading to the pub for celebratory drinks, while the Bard account manager would be heading back to the office to be told off.    Bard commits the cardinal sin of completely missing the brief, instead relying on strange use of lazy cliché for its slogan “Delicious treats that make your dog beg for more”. That slogan would have left its gourmet dog food client scratching their heads wondering how exactly it made their product different from any other dog food. The USP of the product is clearly its premium quality, as spelt out in the brief.  GPT-4 nails the brief with the slogan: “Indulge your pooch: delightful desserts for distinguished dogs”. There’s no question here that you’re looking at an ad for posh dog food. Also bonus points for the use of graphics that lay out the agency’s omnichannel approach across different digital platforms.  In reality both ads resemble things created by people who don’t know how to make adverts. The robots aren’t coming just yet, but they are not a million miles off.

"Investors pile into market rally as economic slowdown risk ebbs","Improving outlook boosts demand for riskier assets as ‘fear of missing out’ returns","Investors’ fears of an economic slowdown are rapidly ebbing, fuelling a rally which is boosting the riskiest asset classes in particular as the “fear of missing out” that dominated stock markets before last year’s sell-off returns in force. The S&P 500 US share index is up 8 per cent since the start of the year and the Nasdaq Composite, which is weighted towards America’s tech giants, has rallied 16 per cent. They were down by a fifth and a third respectively last year. Friday’s blockbuster US jobs report helped bolster investors’ confidence about the strength of the American economy, despite the risk that it could prod the US Federal Reserve to keep monetary policy tighter for longer as it attempts to subdue still-high inflation. Markets closed up on the week despite dipping after the jobs report was published.  “Markets are pricing in the end of the inflation problem and . . . very heavily discounting the risk of a tail event,” said Nitin Saksena, head of US equity derivatives research at Bank of America, referring to unlikely but high impact events that are difficult to model. “The risk of a severe recession, a policy mistake, or a second wave of inflation is becoming an afterthought,” he said. Cboe’s Vix index, which tracks investor expectations of volatility over the next month and is often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, has plunged since the start of the year. It has been below its long-term average of 20 for two consecutive weeks, the longest stretch of low volatility since the beginning of last year. The one-year Vix, which tracks expectations of stock market swings over the next year, this week touched its lowest level since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “This tells you there’s some really strong reassessment of the future, not just the next month,” said Saksena.  Assets that were among the most beaten-up in last year’s sell-off are now the best performers. Bitcoin has jumped over 40 per cent, while Cathy Wood’s ARK Innovation fund — which is dominated by high-growth tech stocks — is up 46 per cent.  Analysts and investors at large banks and asset managers such as Morgan Stanley, UBS and BlackRock have repeatedly argued that markets have been too optimistic, but stocks have so far largely shrugged off weak fourth quarter corporate results. This is despite the fact the S&P 500 is on track to report its first year on year earnings decline since the height of the pandemic. They have also ignored the Fed’s insistence that it will hold interest rates at an elevated level for a long time rather than quickly pivot to cuts. The sudden improvement in the global economic outlook has bolstered the optimists’ argument. As recently as the start of this year, the IMF was warning that a third of the world faced a downturn; but this week it raised its forecasts and said the world was “well away from any [sign of] global recession”. Investors are becoming increasingly confident that the Fed can subdue inflation without causing a major recession. On several occasions last year, Fed chair Jay Powell helped to end similar market rallies by warning that the central bank did not want financial conditions to ease too soon. This week, however, he appeared relaxed about the recent gains, noting that “our focus is not on short-term moves” and declaring for the first time that “the disinflationary process has started”. The extent of the rally has been exacerbated by factors ranging from timing to investor psychology.  For some hedge funds and quantitative investors, a drop in the Vix has a mechanical effect on risk calculations that leads them to increase leverage and add exposure to stocks. For many wealth managers, meanwhile, tax incentives created extra selling pressure in December and the chance to pick up bargains in the new year. “If you had anything you were contemplating getting out of, December was the time to do it,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “Once those tax loss harvesting opportunities go away, people have money to spend and an opportunity to buy everything 20 per cent off.” Once prices have started to rise, it becomes increasingly difficult for other investors to resist, even if their views on the economic outlook have not fundamentally changed.  Mike Lewis, head of US equity cash trading at Barclays, said: “There is a lot of cash on the sidelines after last year and that creates a conundrum [for investors] — people don’t want to miss a rally . . . you get a little bit of FOMO [fear of missing out].” Lewis said the recent outperformance of assets like lossmaking tech stocks is “not what sustainable rallies are made of” but there were few obvious events on the horizon that could trigger a reversal. Still, even some optimists believe the extent of the rally has become extreme.  Jonathan Golub, chief US market strategist at Credit Suisse, said there were “lots of reasons to build a positive narrative, and I think the bears are ignoring that there is a lot of good news” but “the market is behaving as if we’re on the other side of a recession that hasn’t even happened yet”. Lewis suggested that economic data would be more important than Fed commentary in changing investors’ minds about the outlook for interest rates — but that could take several months. “The thing that could create a risk hiccup is if we don’t start seeing some slack in the labour market [by the time] we approach the summer,” he said. “It could lead to a tough second half, but that’s a long way away.”","05.02.2023"
"India chases dividend from China trade tensions","Country hopes to benefit from companies diversifying supply chains","Do you make semiconductors? Harshadeep Kamble, 25-year veteran of India’s civil service, wants to make you an offer you can’t refuse. The principal secretary for industry in India’s wealthiest state, Maharashtra, Kamble says he is pursuing three to four foreign semiconductor companies, not all Taiwanese, with juicy incentives packages: “We are telling these companies, this is what we already have on the platter for them. What is it further they would like to have?” Semiconductors is the most ambitious industry Maharashtra seeks to attract, as India’s states aim to position themselves as a viable “plus one” for companies diversifying supply chains away from China.  Kamble is planning a roadshow in Taiwan to build the industry’s confidence. He wants to show his state has stripped back bureaucracy, expedited clearances, and is offering sweeteners from capital subsidies to tax-based incentives, to encourage investment. India has been trying to reverse a historical manufacturing deficit compared with southern Asian peers with a “Make in India” campaign. With 6mn people entering the labour market every year, according to UBS, India wants to create badly needed jobs. It has committed $34bn to production-linked incentive schemes to encourage companies to take risks building factories. And Indian states are competing hard against each other to attract investment. The southern state of Tamil Nadu has long been a pioneer. It already boasts manufacturing by the likes of computer producer Dell, South Korea’s technology group Samsung and carmaker Hyundai. Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron are manufacturing Apple’s iPhone 14 in the state and Karnataka. Maharashtra earlier this year lost out to Gujarat to be the site of a $19.4bn chipmaking complex for Foxconn and Indian industrial group Vedanta. Despite the urgency to reorientate supply chains, experts say foreign investment is not exactly pouring into Indian manufacturing just yet. Foreign direct investment equity inflow from April, the start of the financial year, to September was down 14 per cent on the previous year, at $27bn. “In terms of the inflows, we don’t see a stepping up,” says Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert and professor at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Dhar says industrialists continue to complain about skill shortages and lack of infrastructure. Sachit Jain, managing director of Punjab-based Vardhman Special Steels, understands why foreign investors are wary. “India is not an easy country to work with,” he says. “But will you focus on the problems, or will you focus on the opportunities?”  Jain has pursued a common model for foreign investment — a joint venture. In 2019, Vardhman sold an 11.4 per cent stake in a $7mn deal to Aichi Steel Corporation Japan, an affiliate of auto company Toyota. The tie-up was designed to ensure Toyota had supply options outside Japan, Jain says. But Aichi’s credibility has also helped Vardhman gain traction in south-east Asian markets. Some analysts argue that India is quietly benefiting from supply chain shifts. “We don’t have to think that we will become China,” says Samir Arora, founder and fund manager of Helios Capital, which invests in Indian stocks. “But can we get a bit more growth? That is happening.” Producers of goods from specialised chemicals to towels say that they are finding new markets for export as Chinese rivals fall from favour. Take India’s largest transmission towers manufacturer Skipper, a listed company based in Kolkata. Company executive director Sharan Bansal expects export sales to double from just under Rs4bn in the last financial year, ending in March, to Rs8bn this year. Along with developing countries increasingly eschewing Chinese financing, some US companies now stipulate Chinese products should not be used in projects, Bansal says, all of which has helped him sell more towers. “We have actively gone out and pursued customers in the countries where we know that there’s a strong anti-China sentiment,” Bansal says. Ashok Kajaria, chair and managing director of India’s largest tile-maker Kajaria Ceramics, says a collapse in Chinese imports has let him sell more tiles domestically. Back in Maharashtra, Kamble is not letting a good crisis go to waste. If companies manufacturing in Europe want to diversify “because the energy cost has gone very, very high there,” he says, “we have offered them Maharashtra as a solution”.  chloe.cornish@ft.com","20.12.2022"
"Global stocks rise ahead of US inflation report","Britain’s FTSE 100 moved within striking distance of an all-time high on hopes that inflation has peaked","US stocks rose as investors prepared for inflation data that analysts expect to show a slowdown in domestic price growth, which could buoy the hopes of traders despite hawkish messaging from the Federal Reserve. On Wall Street, the blue-chip S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent higher on Wednesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.8 per cent. It marked the first time in about three weeks the S&P 500 had notched back-to-back daily gains, while the Nasdaq Composite scored its first four-day winning streak in four months. The gains come ahead of US inflation data due to be released on Thursday morning. Analysts expect the headline consumer price index will moderate to 6.5 per cent in December, down from 7.1 per cent in November. Investors have seized on economic data that have shown a slowdown in price growth and softness in a still-tight US labour market, even though members of the Fed this week reiterated their intention to hold the federal funds rate at a restrictive level to stamp out high inflation.  “More risk-tolerant investors can look to anticipate this turn [in monetary policy] by phasing into markets, seeking early winners from a global improvement in sentiment, and identifying beneficiaries from China’s reopening,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote on Tuesday. “However, we don’t believe we have yet reached the inflection point in policy or economic growth.” Across the Atlantic, Britain’s FTSE 100 moved within striking distance of an all-time high as growing investor optimism that inflation had peaked boosted US and European stocks. The UK’s benchmark stock index rose 0.4 per cent, leaving it within about 2 per cent of the historic peak it reached in May 2018.  The gains in the London market echoed other regional bourses, with the regional Stoxx Europe 600 adding 0.4 per cent and Germany’s Dax rallying 1.2 per cent.  UK markets lagged behind the big US equity rally in 2020 and 2021, which was led by high-flying growth stocks such as Apple, Alphabet and Tesla. But the FTSE 100 dodged the carnage in global equities last year because it is filled with the type of companies that prospered in an environment where interest rates and energy prices were rising. Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil major that is the second-biggest company on the London Stock Exchange, gained 43 per cent last year. HSBC, the banking heavyweight, gained 15 per cent as higher interest rates boosted its profits. In dollar terms, their gains would have been smaller, at 28 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.   The rallies contrasted sharply with big US companies, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shedding a third of its value last year.  Equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic have advanced this year on the back of signs inflation in many of the world’s biggest economies is softening and despite warnings from the Fed and the European Central Bank that interest rates have further to climb. Figures out on Thursday are expected to show that US consumer price growth continued to slow in December. Inflation also appears to have peaked in Europe, with price growth slowing in France, Germany and Spain. Central bank officials insist it would be premature to pause their monetary tightening campaigns. Projections published in December show most Fed officials expecting the fed funds rate to peak at between 5 per cent and 5.25 per cent, up from its current level of between 4.25 per cent and 4.5 per cent. ECB president Christine Lagarde said in December that markets should expect rates to rise “at a 50-basis-point pace for a period of time”. The size of future interest rate increases — as well as the depth of the recessions expected in Europe and the US later this year — now dominates debate. “A friendly December [consumer prices index] print sets up for a 25bp hike and that could very well prove to be the end for this cycle,” said Steven Blitz, chief US economist at TS Lombard. “Beyond the near term, mild recession or no recession, inflation will be settling closer to 3 per cent than 2 per cent, owing to the structural imbalance in the labour market.”  Jobs growth in the world’s biggest economy slowed for a fifth consecutive month in December, while wage growth declined to 4.6 per cent and the unemployment rate fell to a historic low. Fed officials have made it clear that inflation continuing to cool depends to a large extent on unemployment rising later this year, even as the economy grapples with worker shortages in service sectors such as hospitality and travel. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.5 per cent, taking its gains since the start of November to 45 per cent.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Banks capitalise on fleeing depositorsBiotech M&A makes a breakthroughTelling private bankers to be discreet Wall Street’s battle for bank deposits When the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from 0 per cent to nearly 5 per cent, the move began to eat up the cash that leveraged companies and commercial property groups loaded up with floating rate debt generated.  But for many on Wall Street, the big surprise of 2023 is that higher base rates have caused a slow-motion banking crisis well before an expected wave of corporate distress emerged. Big banks have been steadily losing deposits for the past year as customers rerouted their cash to higher-yielding products such as money market funds. It has led to an existential issue for some large US regional lenders.  After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank exposed the pressure banks face as rates normalise, billions more in deposits fled smaller lenders, kicking off a high-stakes race on Wall Street to hoover up the extra liquidity. JPMorgan Chase led the pack with $37bn in new deposits in the first quarter, bringing total deposits to $2.38tn. “The number one, two or three things to watch this quarter are deposits, deposits, deposits,” Jason Goldberg, a research analyst at Barclays, told the FT earlier this month. It’s not just regional lenders that have bled deposits. America’s largest brokerage Charles Schwab has been hit by a strategy of investing customer deposits in secure, long-dated bonds and mortgage-backed securities that have since lost billions in value. GQG, one of Schwab’s biggest investors disclosed this week that it had sold its entire $1.4bn stake as concerns over paper losses on its bond portfolios spiked last month.  Though JPMorgan is pulling in cash during yet another crisis, its longtime boss Jamie Dimon isn’t getting too comfortable, warning investors on Friday that potential “storm clouds” are gathering as inflation threatens to tip the US into a recession. Still, he has more to celebrate than his Wall Street counterpart David Solomon, head of Goldman Sachs, who must unwind strategic mistakes and navigate the economic turmoil. Solomon has followed up an aggressive cost-cutting campaign with lacklustre earnings punctuated by an 18 per cent slump in the bank’s first-quarter profits because of poor fixed-income trading results. Solomon has also slapped a “for sale” sign on home improvement lender GreenSky just 13 months after he steered its purchase for $2.2bn. It’s another step in paring back Goldman’s consumer banking ambitions. Goldman’s latest collaboration with Apple has come at an opportune time, though, as US depositors explore greener pastures. On Monday, the duo launched a new savings account yielding 4.15 per cent a year, more than 10 times the national average rate. Goldman has a chance to succeed in its newest push for deposits, but it will be a zero sum outcome. The money will have fled a bank or brokerage elsewhere in the financial system, underscoring that the havoc of rising rates still hasn’t fully filtered through Wall Street. Biotech M&A on the mend In the latest sign that the pharmaceutical market is warming up, GSK has agreed to buy Canadian biotech Bellus Health for $2bn.   Bankers have been hoping that the diving valuations in the biotech sector, after a sell-off that started in 2021, would lead to a boom in M&A. Tempted by good deals, Big Pharma would seek drugs to restock pipelines.  But the past few months have shown that large drugmakers aren’t looking to scoop up undervalued assets. Rather, they are happy to pay a premium for companies with drugs that are in late-stage trials or already on the market. GSK paid a more than 100 per cent premium for Bellus. And earlier this week, New Jersey pharma titan Merck paid a 75 per cent premium on its $10.8bn deal to buy Prometheus Biosciences. There’s a method to Merck’s madness. The company could lose exclusivity over its best-selling cancer drug five years from now, and making expensive dealmaking bets has become a critical survival mechanism for industry heavyweights, Lex notes. The deal comes just a few weeks after Pfizer spent $43bn on SeaGen, a cancer treatments maker previously pursued by Merck. And while Pfizer only paid a 35 per cent premium to SeaGen’s previous Friday closing price, that’s just because the oncology-focused biotech had been in talks with buyers for several months. Pfizer’s price of $229 a share was far higher than Merck’s offer of $200 a share last summer, according to people familiar with the matter.  Flush with cash, pharma’s internal business development teams may be less interested in nabbing a bargain than ensuring their own job security, people familiar with the matter tell the FT’s Hannah Kuchler.  So instead of following the money, follow the clinical data: as assets get derisked, more bidding wars could ignite. Private bankers, keep quiet Three times a year, executives from some of the world’s biggest private banks — including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup — sit down with regulators in Singapore to discuss the city-state’s booming industry of private wealth management.  The forum, known as the Private Banking Industry Group, has been meeting for more than a decade. But the context has changed significantly in recent years as the super-wealthy — many of them from China — have poured larger and larger sums into Singapore.  The city-state has been trying hard to establish itself as a hub for private wealth. One banker based in Singapore said inflows from China “are probably overrunning” the “best expectations of what was going to happen”, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Mercedes Ruehl and Leo Lewis report.  That growth has brought difficulties. Singapore is trying to tread a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tension between Washington and Beijing. An influx of Chinese money risks sparking a domestic pushback, widening the income gap as rents soar.  Multiple people who attended the meeting or were briefed on its contents told the FT that the Monetary Authority of Singapore gave a clear message: it wanted banks to avoid public discussion of the origins of the cash that has been flooding in.  That Singapore would send this message to private bankers, a group not known for high levels of transparency and disclosure about their work, is a sign of just how sensitive the issue has become.  After the FT’s story came out, the MAS published a statement on its website saying it “has not issued any directive to banks — tacit or otherwise — to avoid discussing the origins of wealth inflows into Singapore”. Which means, presumably, we can look forward to detailed disclosures from now on.

"Consultants start to cut jobs as boom time ends","McKinsey and KPMG first to move as clients reduce costs and battle inflation","Job cuts at McKinsey and KPMG this month are the first concrete sign that a boom in spending on consultants that started during the coronavirus pandemic might be over, as clients move to reduce costs and battle inflation. Companies short on staff and desperate to make their operations digital after the pandemic paid record amounts to consultants in the past two years. Demand for advice on tech, dealmaking and implementing net zero pledges fuelled a boom in consultants’ profits and ignited a pay and recruitment war.  But soaring costs, the end of near-free borrowing for clients and a slump in deal activity have led to a more difficult outlook for parts of the big consultancies’ businesses — and spurred the first significant cuts in the sector, following the announcement of big reductions at large companies such as Meta and Goldman Sachs.  KPMG is cutting nearly 700 jobs in its US advisory business and about 200 in Australia — about 2 per cent of its total workforce in each country. Meanwhile, McKinsey will make up to 2,000 of its 45,000 people redundant as part of a global restructuring following years of rapid expansion.  Frantic hiring by consultants in the past 18 months had been reminiscent of the surge in recruitment during the dotcom boom more than two decades ago, which ended in mass job cuts, said Fiona Czerniawska, chief executive at analyst Source Global Research. “I think we’ll see more [redundancies] than we saw in Covid but not as much as we saw in 2002 because firms are more circumspect about the reputational damage of letting large groups of people go,” said Czerniawska.  Consultants remain busy advising on tech, ESG and supply chain issues but areas such as deal advisory are quieter, according to people in the industry.  “The market is still buoyant but we’re in a period of steady growth, rather than the hypergrowth that accompanied the post-pandemic deals frenzy,” said Kevin Ellis, UK chair of PwC.  The slump in dealmaking has hit the banking sector particularly hard, leading them to slash how much they spend on consultants.   In two years as head of Italian lender UniCredit, Andrea Orcel has cut the bank’s €150mn annual spend on consultants by more than half. Credit Suisse aimed to halve its spending on consultants last year, compared to 2021 when it spent SFr2bn on professional services hiring 16,430 consultants, contractors and outsourced workers. It reduced its external consultant headcount by a fifth in the final quarter of 2022. Its roster of advisers has included McKinsey, which reviewed risk management and worked on a 2021 revamp of the business, and Deloitte, which advised on pay policy.  Fellow Swiss bank UBS has also been slashing spending on consultants as part of its drive to cut $1bn of costs by the end of this year. Globally, consultants’ revenue growth is expected to slow from 10.8 per cent in 2022 to 7.7 per cent this year, according to research by Source Global. The Big Four — Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC — reported global revenue increases of between 8 per cent and 18 per cent in their most recent annual results.   In the UK, KPMG has been moving staff, including deal advisers, to other parts of the firm where there is more work, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. The firm declined to say how many employees were moving but said that its model of combining multiple business lines allows it to “redeploy people into the busy areas of our business as the economy shifts”. It said it was not considering any UK redundancies.  As well as transferring people between business lines, PwC’s UK arm had been increasing the number of staff it was seconding overseas, including in areas where there was more demand for advisers, said Ellis. The firm is betting that the arrangement will help the Middle East business, where government-backed projects have driven a surge in consulting, and incentivise staff to join or remain. PwC UK also said it was not currently planning any redundancy programmes.  The Big Four have a long history of moving people from one part of their business to another in response to tough economic conditions. Consultants at other firms said a pivot by the Big Four, McKinsey, Bain and Boston Consulting Group away from deals work and into other areas, including ESG, tech and turnround work, would increase price competition.  One senior consultant in the UK said he had heard about competitors offering clients free consulting advice from staff with nothing else to do. But transferring employees between divisions has become more difficult in recent years as consultants become more specialised in areas such as regulation, risk and cyber security. “It’s harder in practice than in theory,” said one Big Four executive.  Uneven growth in different parts of the firms could mean some business lines keep recruiting while others let staff go.  McKinsey’s job cuts are focused entirely on staff who do not work for clients directly, such as those in human resources, technology and communications. The firm was seeking to centralise some of its support teams after expanding from 28,000 people to 45,000 in the past five years, including through a series of acquisitions, said a person familiar with the details.  Several people in the industry said firms that avoid formal redundancy programmes for client-facing staff could seek to more aggressively “manage people out” of their businesses by clamping down on minimum performance requirements. “I think that’s bound to happen,” said Czerniawska.  Consultants slashed their own costs such as travel during the pandemic but those savings have already been largely absorbed by salary increases.  McKinsey, Bain and Boston Consulting Group unveiled one of the biggest rounds of pay rises for new hires in more than two decades last year, raising base annual salaries for MBA hires in the US to more than $190,000.  Rapid recruitment in the past two years has been predicated on high staff turnover rates, which have now slowed. A more sluggish economy means staff now have fewer exit options. A more difficult funding environment for start-ups, which increasingly compete with consultancies for staff, has also reduced attrition.  “No one is going off from here to create a hydrogen start-up now,” said the Big Four executive.  The other question for the people running large consultancies is whether record partner payouts can be sustained. Pay for the average UK partner at Deloitte and PwC topped £1mn in 2022.  High profits “can be sustained by making bigger cutbacks”, said Czerniawska, adding that firms would have to think carefully about whether to try to repeat last year’s payouts. “What clients are asking for is innovation, and that takes money. Therefore perhaps [consultants] should accept lower profits while making those big investments.”","24.02.2023"
"How to fix FICC","Diversify within the business, not away from it","Rupak Ghose is a board adviser to fintech companies, the former head of corporate strategy at ICAP/NEX and a former financials research analyst at Credit Suisse. It’s now conventional wisdom that banks need to diversify away from trading to develop more recurring revenue streams. Equity research analysts, shareholders, consultants, investment bankers and media jump to highlight how fixed-income, currency and commodity (FICC) trading is a structurally low-PE-multiple business, given its volatility and capital requirements. But the FICC trading machine churns on and on, not only surviving but carrying investment-bank cost bases on its shoulders. In 2022, FICC generated around a fifth of group revenues of the largest five US investment banks, and it has probably provided a similar level for major European players.  Last year was the Year of the Macro Trader, especially in US rates and commodities markets. The below data from Bank of America’s and Citi’s earnings illustrates how much macro volatility supported FICC revenues in 2022.  © Rupak Ghose’s calculations© Rupak Ghose’s calculations 2022 was also the Year of Volatility. For banks’ trading desks, this was an especially good kind of volatility, not only boosting revenues from companies doing more hedging, but juicing performance for important hedge-fund clients as well.  While the hedge fund industry overall saw negative returns in 2022, macro and multi-strategy funds had stellar returns. This trend naturally benefited banks where hedge funds make up a greater share of clients. No firm has benefited from this more than Goldman Sachs. Their FICC revenues more than doubled over the past five years and were more than 25% higher than the elevated levels of 2020. In contrast, the traditional market leaders JPM and Citi delivered FICC revenues 10 to 15 per cent below their 2020 records. This is unsurprising, given their strong forex franchises and lower exposure to commodities than Goldman. Even so, Goldman came out of earnings season as the ugly duckling. Be more like Morgan Stanley, we all heckled. The “Pepsi trick”, as the FT wrote, of diversifying into more recurring, high-return wealth management businesses is a sensible one for all banks to consider. If Barclays hadn’t sold BGI, for example, it would look more like Morgan Stanley. There’s a problem, though: good acquisitions are difficult to find, and new businesses’ buildouts rarely move the dial.  M&A scenarios look good in theory, but sellers of leading franchises are rare. For every UBS there is a Credit Suisse wealth management. For every Capital Group there is an Abrdn. For every Lloyds there is a Metro bank. Non-FICC businesses aren’t inherently high-growth, stable or profitable. So, what about organic growth? The law of large numbers kicks in here. Nowhere is this more important than at Goldman Sachs. When you generate almost $15bn of annual FICC revenues, any organic diversification strategy is going to be a rounding error. And as we saw with Goldman, moving away from your core competencies comes with risks. Banks are stuck with FICC. Where diversification is achieved it is often by accident rather than design. For instance, the trading implosion at Credit Suisse. In fact, in Credit Suisse’s case, the ostensibly higher-quality wealth management business imploded soon after as well.  So how should they make the best of the situation? There are several hygiene factors I would focus on. The first is diversification. And I mean diversification within FICC. Unlike equities, this is a fairly heterogenous business, spanning multiple asset classes, client bases, geographies, and products.  To demonstrate what that means, I’ll give an example:   In the bank’s latest earning call, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon proudly highlighted how his team had delivered on his goal of expanding wallet share with the bank’s largest trading clients. Goldman is now in the top three for 77 of its largest 100 trading clients, versus 44 only 3 years ago.  This is a great achievement, of course. At a time when clients are consolidating their spend, being top 3 with them drives material profitability. Liquidity drives liquidity, creating network effects in trading, and there is the benefit of scale on cost structures. But it raises a question: how diversified are those revenues?  JPMorgan and Citigroup’s FICC businesses are more diversified than Goldman Sachs. They also benefit from the moat provided by consistent captive flows from their broader banking relationships. These factors ensure that their FICC businesses are less volatile than Goldman Sachs. This should be more valuable to shareholders over the long run in terms of valuation multiples. There will always be differences in mix; Goldman Sachs will never be a top-3 FX franchise, given the lack of a leading transaction banking network. But demonstrating more diversification and stability for FICC revenues can’t be underestimated. This is a reason why going big in transaction banking is much more relevant for a firm like Goldman than chasing sexy credit-card deals with Apple. Banks must also demonstrate they are winning in structural high growth markets.  Banks invented credit derivatives, but their ETF businesses have lost out to players like Jane Street. This is also true in markets where underlying structures have changed. Banks struggled to compete with high-frequency trading firms as the US Treasury market moved electronic on cash and futures CLOBs. As market consensus builds on a “broken” Treasury market will they be the solution? A path to that could be through regulatory changes allowing them to hold more inventory, or looking for ways to prosper as clearing sponsors. Finally, banks should take a leaf out of the playbook of the exchanges and electronic trading platforms which have come to dominate the FICC market data space through a combination of organic and acquisitive growth. Perhaps Goldman Sachs could turn its Marquee platform into the next Aladdin. In any event, banks are stuck with FICC, so they need to make the best of it. Diversification. Lower volatility. New markets. All of these options make sense to do — at least, within FICC. Chasing revenues alone is a loser’s game. Instead banks should show investors that not all FICC businesses should be valued on the same multiple.","10.02.2023"
"How antitrust fears clouded the largest buyout of 2023","Plus, venture capitalists head to the Middle East and Elliott flexes its muscle in Japan","One scoop to start: SoftBank has moved to sell almost all of its remaining shareholding in Alibaba, limiting its exposure to China and raising cash as the market downturn pummels the value of its technology investments.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Thoma Bravo’s Qualtrics fumbleVCs go to the GulfActivists circle Japan Thoma Bravo’s failed attempt to buy Qualtrics When German software conglomerate SAP announced a plan to sell its majority stake in Qualtrics in January, it set off a feeding frenzy to strike the year’s largest leveraged buyout.  Twenty-two groups signed non-disclosure agreements and 43 meetings were held in a three month sprint that was won by Silver Lake, which had quietly put the company in play at the end of 2022 and whose co-head Egon Durban sat on the company’s board. Though Silver Lake paid $12.5bn, or $18.15 a share, for the software company, it wasn’t the price that sealed its victory, but instead antitrust issues. The FT’s Antoine Gara, Eric Platt and James Fontanella-Khan report that software buyouts group Thoma Bravo was prepared to beat Silver Lake’s takeover price for Qualtrics, but was stymied by antitrust fears that ultimately caused SAP and Qualtrics to accept a lower, less risky bid. A proxy statement filed by Qualtrics on Wednesday morning, along with the FT’s reporting, shows that Thoma Bravo bid $21 a share for the company, about 15 per cent more than Silver Lake. But its board had deep fears that the effort would be slowed and eventually blocked by US antitrust authorities. “Antitrust” is mentioned more than 40 times in a background section that details how regulatory fears were the decisive issue in a private equity buyout — deals that historically haven’t caught the attention of antitrust authorities. But Thoma Bravo is the largest investor globally in software companies and had taken Medallia, a direct competitor to Qualtrics, private for more than $6bn in 2021. It planned to eventually merge the two companies.  Qualtrics advisers feared Thoma Bravo’s ownership of the two companies would cause regulators to conduct a “second review” of the deal and ultimately block it, the proxy filing revealed. The deal drama offers a rare glimpse into the chilling effect that regulators in the Biden administration are having on dealmaking. It also may be music to the ears of Jonathan Kanter, head of the US Department of Justice’s antitrust unit. “There is no success greater for us than deterrence,” Kanter told a conference last month. One way of deterrence are formal antitrust reviews, “but I can tell you, there are many more non-public abandonments”, he said. The ramifications may be felt by firms besides Thoma Bravo. Dealmakers who spoke to the FT said such “strategic” acquisitions have become harder to pull off. The threat of a second review can throw closing timelines and strategy into chaos. Firms like Thoma Bravo that hold numerous investments in a single sector may find the newfound scrutiny painful. It is in the process of responding to a second request review on a separate buyout of cyber security company ForgeRock after a flurry of acquisitions in the sector. VCs are making Saudi Arabia the new Silicon Valley In the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder by Saudi Arabian operatives in late 2018, a number of high-profile western businesses, including venture capital firms, stopped publicly working with the country.  But as capital has dried up, Silicon Valley investors have quietly reversed course on earlier decisions to refuse meetings with, or cash from, Saudi Arabia. As a partner at one Silicon Valley venture fund put it: “The Four Seasons in Riyadh is basically Palo Alto.” Fundraising by venture capital firms sunk to a nine-year low at the end of 2022, and cash that VCs put into start-ups has plunged more than 50 per cent over the past 12 months. As DD’s Tabby Kinder and George Hammond report, Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East more broadly, have emerged as a shimmering oasis for tech investment.    Prominent tech investors have flocked to the kingdom, sometimes with personal invites from Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia’s $620bn sovereign wealth fund. The change of heart is largely driven by the recent economic downturn, which has made it increasingly difficult to raise a new venture fund. Mohammed bin Salman, left, and Ben Horowitz © FT montage/Bloomberg/AFP/Getty Images The Public Investment Fund, in particular, has been particularly adept at getting into US tech over the past decade. It contributed almost 50 per cent of SoftBank’s $100bn Vision Fund in 2016, made a $3.5bn investment in Uber in 2016 and more than $1bn in electric-car maker Lucid Motors in 2018. One partner called dealing with countries such as Saudi Arabia a “Faustian bargain”, where firms have to put their values to one side. “Venture capital went from being the Hermès Birkin bag of investing to Target,” they added. The PIF venture arm also recently disclosed its partnerships with nearly 40 US venture firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, and 9Yards Capital, where former UK chancellor George Osborne is a managing partner. Tiger Global has meanwhile been pursuing investment from Saudi Arabia as part of its latest $6bn fundraising, according to people familiar with the matter, while a team from venture firm IVP toured the region, according to one person with knowledge of the trip. No wonder prominent VCs such as Ben Horowitz have praised the kingdom as a “start-up country”. Tokyo embraces a new activist regime Elliott Management can now claim one of the biggest victories in Japan’s chequered and setback-strewn history of shareholder activism. Shares of Dai Nippon Printing — a nearly 150 year-old Japanese conglomerate that makes components for electric vehicle batteries and smartphone screens — have surged more than 40 per cent since the FT first revealed Elliott’s stake. In the ensuing months, DNP announced it would undertake the biggest share buyback in its history while also setting a return on equity target of 10 per cent. “We didn’t do it because Elliott told us to do it, but other investors had told us similar things and we realised that the direction they were seeking was not that different from ours,” Hirofumi Hashimoto, DNP’s managing director, told the FT’s Leo Lewis, Kana Inagaki and Eri Sugiura. The scale and speed of DNP’s announcement represents a seismic shift in a country where activists have often only left a marginal impact on their targets. The fact that it has occurred, Japan-focused investors say, could point to greater market confidence that companies can no longer afford to be complacent. Years of low valuations have helped shift the view of Japanese authorities, who are focused on underperforming companies. New rules from the JPX, the group controlling the Tokyo Stock Exchange, would oblige companies that persistently trade below their book value to disclose plans to remedy that situation. That naming and shaming could prompt action. According to analysts, 53 per cent of companies in the broad Topix index of Japanese stocks are trading below their book value. Elliott itself is rebuilding its presence in the Tokyo market by expanding its Japan-focused team, with the implicit threat that, in theory, no Japanese companies are off its radar.

"Where’s the credit crunch?","And more on goods consumption and inequality","This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. Late last year, Meta had stunk things up badly, and its stock was down 75 per cent from the 2021 peak. After some upbeat sales guidance yesterday, the stock was only down 45 per cent from its peak. Not bad for a company still dumping billions into the metaverse cash furnace. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com. Credit crunch watch Are First Republic’s problems a sign of a wider credit crunch? Lots of smart people think so. Here’s Adam Hoyes of Capital Economics: Deposit outflows at First Republic Bank don’t tell us much more than we already knew about the state of the broader US banking sector. But it highlights the evidence of an ongoing credit crunch . . . Alongside the higher interest rates banks may need to pay on deposits to limit further outflows, we expect that their earnings will also come under pressure from higher loan loss provisions . . . In turn, that suggests to us that financial conditions are likely to remain tight . . . which would probably only exacerbate both the hit to activity and the situation in commercial real estate. In one sense, it is obvious that we are in a credit crunch: short-term interest rates have risen almost 5 per cent! That’s crunchy! The increase has had a big effect on how much it costs to finance, for example, cars and houses, and the prices of those things are now on the decline. Outside of a few bank blow-ups and some highly rate-sensitive areas, though, the evidence of serious economic pain is scant.  Start with some basics. Here are yields and spreads on triple-B bonds, the lowest rung of investment grade. Triple-B yields are significantly higher because Treasury yields are higher. But spreads, which would indicate whether companies are at a higher risk of default because of higher funding costs, remain narrow:  While spreads (a measure of price) have not blown out, issuance (a measure of quantity) has slumped. As of the first quarter, mortgage-backed securities issuance had fallen 59 per cent, corporate debt 31 per cent and asset-backed securities 49 per cent, according to Matthew Mish of UBS. Partly these big year-over-year numbers reflect soaring issuance after the pandemic began, but first-quarter issuance sagged. His chart below extrapolates what issuance levels would look like if the 2023 pattern holds:  Mish warns that while bank credit growth looks fine, the trend in economically sensitive commercial and industrial lending does not look good. His measure of C&I loan growth (which strips out loans used for M&A) pegs it at 1 per cent. Publicly available data looks better. Below is year-over-year growth in banks’ total C&I loan volumes (the pink line), which remains high but has clearly turned over. What is worrisome is the Federal Reserve’s loan officer’s survey for C&I (the blue line). Almost half of banks say they are tightening standards, and none say they are loosening them. In the past, this level of tightening has almost always been accompanied by outright declines in lending volumes:  Mish is alarmed: he sees a 5 per cent contraction in C&I lending in the fourth quarter of this year, and a 10 per cent decline in the first quarter of 2024, “near recessionary levels”. It is open to question, however, how much the current economic cycle will look like those of 2008 and 2001. The pandemic, and the response to it, were unusual events. It is worth noting in this context that the news from the publicly traded banks is pretty good. Joseph Wang, aka the Fed Guy, has a useful piece in which he makes the case that the US banking system is more or less back to normal after the Silicon Valley Bank shock. He compiled this table of important regional banks, showing terminal deposit betas (a measure of how much deposit costs move in response to the fed funds rate) and loan growth outlooks:  The banks may be too optimistic in their outlooks. That said, those outlooks — mid-single-digits loan growth — are simply not consistent with a credit-driven recession this year. And 40-ish per cent deposit betas (that is, 40 basis point increases in deposit costs for every percentage point increase in Fed funds) is consistent with prior cycles and is, Wang thinks, “very manageable”.    Dominic White of Absolute Strategy Research thinks otherwise. As savers flock to money markets, deposit competition is increasing, which should pressure bank profitability and further tighten lending standards: Increased competition for deposits is likely to force banks to pay up for funding. As marginal funding costs rise, net interest margins will contract. Banks might raise loan rates somewhat to try and protect those margins, but this will act as a further headwind to credit growth and broader economic activity. It’s possible that this feeds back into the banking system via deteriorating asset quality. Asset classes such as commercial real estate are a potential risk, where collateral values are declining and maturing loans will need to be rolled over at significantly higher interest rates. In sum: rates have risen a lot; lending standards are tightening; loan growth is rolling over; bond issuance is down. It makes sense that we would see increasing signs of credit-induced distress before long. So far, however, distress is limited. A few banks have failed. In rate-sensitive sectors such as homes and autos, prices are falling — but only slowly. Default rates are ticking up, not leaping. Most banks are reporting decent asset performance and loan growth. If we are in a credit crunch, we are in its very early innings. (Armstrong & Wu) More on goods spending and inequality  Tuesday’s letter walked through the argument, made by Spencer Hill of Goldman Sachs, that consumer spending on goods may plateau at a high level instead of falling back to its pre-pandemic trend. His case rests on one big change: a 6.2 per cent increase since 2019 in real wage levels for the bottom 50 per cent of earners, creating $150bn a year in new spending power. Because lower-income consumers spend more of each new dollar they earn on goods, demand may have snapped its long-running trend, resulting in charts like this:  Hill’s argument shows how distributional effects have macro implications, and he’s far from the only person noticing the sea change at the bottom of the ladder. A recent working paper by MIT’s David Autor and University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Arindrajit Dube and Annie McGrew (call them ADM) finds a “profound shift in US labour market conditions” for poor, young, non-college workers. As labour markets tightened, and real wages grew at the bottom, inequality fell. ADM estimates that, by one measure, the increase in inequality since 1980 was cut by a quarter. But ADM point out a wrinkle. In a competitive labour market, tightness should help all workers. Yet lately most of the wage gains have gone to quitters: those who left lower-paying jobs for higher-paying ones. Those who didn’t move didn’t gain. This, they say, is what happens under flawed competition, where labour markets are dominated by monopsonists with wide power to set wages.  ADM hint that a tight labour market pressuring monopsonists may in fact improve productivity. When employers need to compete for workers, labour flows away from low-productivity companies (who wilt under the pressure) and towards high-productivity ones (who thrive). They hedge this conclusion a bit, but the broad strokes fit Hill’s suggestion that the pie is just $150bn bigger now.  The question of how sustainable this all is remains, and on that count we received a thoughtful email the other day from a reader, Nick Kennedy of Lloyds. He points out that even if consumption has been higher, the risk of a cyclical downturn still applies and will hit low-income consumers hardest: It’s hard to think that the post-Covid jump in retail sales is immune to the risks presented by the turn in the normal business cycle. A weakening labour market ought to hit those that Goldman posit have supported spending first the most. A turn in the cycle is also likely to be juiced this time by a larger than normal inventory build, reflecting all that earlier supply-chain angst. I suspect a lot of that inventory is the wrong type of inventory, having been far easier to accumulate the stock of the stuff you could get and near impossible to get the things disrupted by supply-chain tears — as anyone who wanted a PlayStation 5 to alleviate lockdown boredom would have told you. A potential disinflationary shock to come perhaps. This boils down to the question we’re all condemned to keep asking until we’re blue in the face: will the Fed curb inflation without a recession? Our guess: higher demand from durably richer consumers, in making both growth and inflation stickier, raises the chances of overtightening, given the long lags of monetary policy and the backward-looking inflation data the Fed relies on. Hill disagrees. His team forecasts a near-miss, with resilient consumption just barely offsetting a drop in housing and business investment. Whatever happens this cycle, the lesson for the next is that tight labour markets shouldn’t be feared. Unless, of course, you run a low-productivity company.

"Milestones and meetings","Joe Biden visits Belfast to mark Good Friday Agreement, and the IMF and World Bank start their spring gatherings","This article is an on-site version of our The Week Ahead newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Sunday Hello and welcome to the working week.  Jonathan is taking a well-deserved break for the next fortnight, so I’ll be taking you through forthcoming events to look out for.  A few world leaders are taking to the air this week. Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is off on his delayed state visit to China and French president Emmanuel Macron is visiting the Netherlands.   President Joe Biden will be the guest of honour in Northern Ireland as the region marks 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement. The US leader is arriving on Tuesday and will then begin a tour that also takes in the Republic of Ireland, including visiting some distant cousins, before flying back to Washington on Friday.  While Biden’s Belfast visit marks a milestone in the Irish peace process, Jude Webber’s excellent Big Read shows that a quarter of a century on some of the paramilitaries that took part in the revolt against British rule have now morphed into something closer to organised crime groups. Northern Ireland remains on a difficult path. The region’s government is locked up by political paralysis as the Democratic Unionist party has boycotted the region’s power-sharing executive for more than a year in protest at the proposed Brexit deal, meaning the rudderless region is missing out on investment. Steve Baker, UK minister for Northern Ireland, has urged the DUP to “seize the moment” of the Good Friday Agreement and end its protest or the British government may have to consider direct rule from London.  While Biden is out of Washington, the IMF and the World Bank have moved in and will be holding their annual spring meeting. Expect a lot of talk about inflation and the plans to bring it under control. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is due to speak on Wednesday and US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen will brief the press on Friday.  This is my first week in the driver’s seat for the Week Ahead and there’s a lot to choose from, but my eye was caught by the big tobacco companies that will on Friday have to pay a collective $9bn to 46 US states as part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. The amount is a percentage of the overall revenues tobacco companies make for the year, and they will continue to pay it while cigarettes are sold in the US.   Contact me at david.hindley@ft.com with your feedback, or if there’s anything interesting happening next week that you think I should cover. If you’re reading the Week Ahead as an email, just hit reply.  Economic data A few pieces of economic data to keep an eye on this week. Canada has an interest rate announcement on Tuesday and the European Central Bank is releasing long-term interest rate statistics for March on Friday. As part of its spring meeting, the IMF will on Tuesday release its global financial stability report, an overview of the health of the worldwide economy.  There are also a clutch of countries releasing data on consumer prices for March, including China on Tuesday and the US on Wednesday, which will offer an indication of how efforts to calm inflation are going.  Companies In the UK, supermarket chain Tesco reports its results for 2022. This will be a bellwether for how UK shoppers are adapting to higher prices. The supermarket boss said in January that inflation had not yet peaked and as a result consumers would move towards cheaper products. There are a few other retail results such as Christian Dior on Tuesday and LVMH on Wednesday that will offer a peek at how the luxury market has fared.  Towards the end of the week banks including Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report first-quarter results, the first since the recent crisis that took down Silicon Valley Bank. Key economic and company reports Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.

"Will the Fed scrap 2 per cent?","And what it might do instead","This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. After weeks of climbing higher, yields fell on Friday, setting off a relief rally in stocks. Suspects include dovish Fedspeak and erratic services activity data. Neither seems terribly durable to us. Higher for longer is the unmistakable drumbeat coming from the Fed. Today, we look ahead to a choice the central bank may well face later this year, which has been attracting interest on Wall Street. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com. Why the Fed might fudge The Federal Reserve has pledged to keep inflation somewhere around 2 per cent. Here is one problem with that: If inflation is largely unpredictable, and hence not finely controllable, then . . . the central bank could always argue that wide misses were the result of bad luck, not bad faith . . . This possible escape hatch for the central bank . . . suggests that building up credibility for its inflation-targeting framework could be a long and arduous process. This, from a 1997 paper by Ben Bernanke and Frederic Mishkin, captures why there is so much hand-wringing anytime someone suggests the Fed ditch its 2 per cent inflation target. Central bank credibility — often defined as its ability to influence long-term interest rates through the short-term policy rate and strategic communication — is hard-won and easily lost. Changing the well-established 2 per cent target risks throwing years of hard-earned credibility away.  Might the Fed do it anyway? On that question, Jay Powell is very tight-lipped. But later this year, he could face an agonising choice between abandoning 2 per cent or engineering a recession. Inflation is an enigma, but as Don Rissmiller of Strategas has argued for months, history suggests it is symmetrical; it falls about as fast as it rises. This implies there is a long way to go, with mounting job losses along the way. It’s no large leap to imagine a scenario where inflation is falling but still above target, while unemployment is rising but not yet recessionary. The political pressure to loosen policy would be immense. The Fed might conclude raising its inflation target, or at least acting chill about enforcing it, is the best of a bad set of options. On the merits, though, the case for a higher inflation target — perhaps 3 per cent — is strong. First, it lets prices adjust more flexibly. In general people like price cuts but hate wage cuts, an asymmetry that makes downturns more violent. Firms have to slow price growth but can’t do the same for wages, so they stop hiring instead. Research suggests running inflation a touch hotter gives prices more room to move, dampening the hit to employment and growth. Second, and more importantly, a higher inflation target keeps rates further from the dreaded zero lower bound. At the ZLB, cutting rates doesn’t do much and the policy alternatives, such as quantitative easing, are messy and more poorly understood. Policy rates are set in nominal terms, but the larger policy stance (how tight or easy monetary policy is) depends on real rates, which in turn depends on inflation. Running inflation hotter would produce higher nominal rates for any given policy stance. That would give the Fed more room to lower nominal rates when it needs to.  Even critics of a higher target nod to this. They counter on different grounds. Maybe 2 per cent isn’t theoretically optimal, but moving to 3 per cent, especially now, would wreck Fed credibility. As Jonathan Pingle, chief US economist at UBS, put it to us: If the central bank suddenly said, ‘OK, our inflation target is 2, we’re not meeting that target, so we’re gonna make the target 3’, then immediately the next question for most economic agents should be: ‘well, maybe they’ll turn around and make it 4’. And if they do that, maybe they’ll turn around and make it 5. That logic is a slippery slope . . . Once it starts to erode [it] creates real problems for the effectiveness of monetary policy. Those problems might include long rates pricing in a big inflation risk premium the Fed can’t dislodge. Last year’s UK gilts crisis shows what can happen in the short run when policymakers lose credibility, notes Michael Metcalfe of State Street Global Markets. Nothing good. Even if something that extreme is unlikely, he thinks a “bond market buyers’ strike” can’t be ruled out. Thundering into this discussion is Olivier Blanchard, the French economist who has for a decade (including in the FT last year) advocated a higher inflation target. Blanchard told Unhedged he thinks the case for a higher target is “overwhelming”. As an academic matter, few would dispute that. But in policymaking terms, too, he downplays the risks to credibility: I think, in the right environment, a one-time goalpost move would be credible. There is no slippery slope here. It is clear that the earlier conclusions and computations that 2 per cent was the right target, and the probability of hitting the ZLB was small, were wrong. I think any reasonable economist, including [Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff and Gramercy’s Mohamed El-Erian], agree about that.   I think there is zero risk of moving the target further and further. I heard the same argument about credibility when central banks started QE.    The point here is that context matters. Dropping anchor at 3 per cent — a still-low inflation rate that makes rate-setting easier in the long run — as the price of avoiding a recession wouldn’t mean the Fed has tossed out its inflation mandate. It means it’s weighing the balance of risks and picking the better option. As we like to say, it makes no sense to do stupid policy in the name of credibility.  However, Blanchard concedes that some credibility hit is likely. Rather than an inflammatory formal target change, he expects a Fed fudge:  When inflation is down to, say, 3 per cent, at some stage in, hopefully, the not too distant future, I am nearly sure the debate will be: Are we willing to further increase unemployment in order to get to 2 per cent, or should we revisit?I suspect the debate will be muddled, central banks will not formally change their target, but will be more relaxed about getting to 2 per cent.  As Andy Haldane pointed out in the FT on Friday, a less aggressive attitude towards the speed of disinflation, once it is clear that policy is tight enough (not there yet!), is the Fed’s hidden policy tool. “They don’t talk about this as a lever,” adds Claudia Sahm, the former Fed economist now at Sahm Consulting. “But the reality is that it’s very fuzzy, and not by accident.” Some discretion over “when, and how fast, and how long” would help “take some pressure off of this 2 per cent vs 3 per cent” debate, she says. But make no mistake: the Fed exercising discretion is a policy choice, carrying many of the same risks as an explicit target change. Sahm points out that before the pandemic, the central bank considered changing its target to 3 per cent, but declined to do so. The Fed likes 2 per cent inflation, in other words. Giving that up to avoid a recession would be defensible. But that decision feels precarious indeed.

"BlackRock’s iShares regains pole position from rival Vanguard","Last year’s net ETF flows at $221bn were lower than in 2021, but Vanguard’s $214bn marked a far steeper decline","Latest news on ETFsVisit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools BlackRock’s iShares exchange traded fund arm dethroned arch-rival Vanguard at the top of the global ETF net flows leaderboard last year, returning to pole position after two years in second place. But the big two also entrenched their duopoly in the ETF industry, with nearest rivals State Street Global Advisors and Invesco suffering deeper wounds from souring market sentiment. European and Asian-based investment houses also fared far worse than their US peers, with weaker inflows and faster declines in assets under management, while the winners included the fast-growing niche of actively managed ETFs.  BlackRock and Vanguard were “almost neck and neck, and then you have got these up-and-coming ETF firms that are benefiting from either active management or styles that were in favour — defensive or income [generating] in particular,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at consultancy VettaFi. iShares attracted net inflows of $221bn in 2022, down 28.3 per cent from a record $308bn in 2021, Morningstar data show, in a year in which overall global ETF inflows fell 32.8 per cent from $1.29tn to $867bn. Vanguard’s inflows fell further, by 39.7 per cent from $355bn to $214bn, according to Morningstar, allowing iShares to claim top spot for the first time since 2019. Despite this, Vanguard’s total ETF assets actually fell slightly less, by 10.3 per cent to $2.1tn, compared to iShares’ 11 per cent decline to $2.9tn.  Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar, said iShares’ stronger flow dynamics suggested more investors might have been looking for market exposures not covered by the relatively narrow range of ETFs offered by Vanguard. “iShares is the dominant player with almost every type of fund on the shelf. Vanguard only offers core products, iShares offers core plus,” Lamont said. The big two’s somewhat differing client bases, with iShares more popular among institutional investors and Vanguard more weighted towards retail and wealth management, may also have been a factor.  SSGA and Invesco, the number three and four providers by assets, suffered far worse, however, with SSGA’s net flows sliding 71.9 per cent and Invesco’s 55.7 per cent, in both cases to $29.2bn.  Rosenbluth attributed this to market dynamics. “Demand for low-cost broad market exposure continued in 2022 with iShares and Vanguard dominating with those products. SSGA and Invesco were hurt by limited demand for their flagship growth-oriented SPY [tracking the S&P 500] and QQQ [Nasdaq 100] products as less expensive alternatives and more dividend/low-volatility/equal-weighted strategies were more popular,” he said. “Invesco lives or dies on ‘the Qs’ in the US,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet, pointing out QQQ is eight times larger than Invesco’s next biggest US ETF.  Charles Schwab, the fifth-largest ETF house, performed better, with only a small decline in both flows and assets. Rosenbluth said Schwab had historically “been a low-cost provider of building blocks, well diversified index-based products [so] when investors begin adopting ETFs they are one of the beneficiaries of that”.  JPMorgan managed to increase its ETF assets by 24.6 per cent to $99.8bn to move into the top 10 of the global rankings, thanks to conversion of some of its mutual funds to ETFs and rising demand for active ETFs. These factors also aided Dimensional Fund Advisors, which enjoyed a 60 per cent jump in assets to $72.4bn. “Dimensional has fairly loyal clients who are banging the door down,” Kashner said. “They are in a very enviable position in the industry, and they operate at a really low asset-weighted expense ratio, 23bp, similar to JPMorgan” — cheap by the standards of active management. Kashner noted that JPMorgan’s Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) had the eighth-largest flows in the US last year, which was “really aggressive growth, considering that it only launched in 2020” . It recorded a 3.5 per cent loss in 2022, while the while the S&P 500 was down 18 per cent. Investors also flocked to leveraged and inverse products last year helping ProShares to rack up a 42.8 per cent rise in inflows to $15bn and Direxion a 729 per cent jump to $11bn — yet both saw assets fall as their geared products typically delivered sharp losses, at least for anyone who held them for an extended period. “There was a clear demand for geared products last year, way out of proportion to what we have seen in recent years,” said Kashner, with these vehicles accounting for 5.2 per cent of US ETF inflows, according to FactSet, up from 1 per cent in 2021 and the previous record high of 2.5 per cent in 2018, led by ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) and Direxion’s Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (SOXL). “And boy did these products lose money in 2022. Not everybody is holding them on an intraday basis as they are meant to, so I worry,” said Kashner. Last year’s losers were concentrated among European and Asian-owned issuers. The nine largest — Nomura, Amundi, Xtrackers, Nikko, Daiwa, UBS, MUFG, Global X and Pimco — all suffered significant falls in both assets and flows, with five of them seeing flows turning negative. “We might be diverging somewhat. We have war on [the European] continent and all sorts of headaches. There still seems to be more optimism in the US,” said Lamont “Passive investing is a scale game and the relative success of some of the larger US ETF managers relates to their size and breadth of offering both in the US and in other large markets such as Europe,” he added.

"The bonfire of the media vanities","Plus, the ties that bind First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse and London’s Spac posterboy makes a mysterious exit","Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: News in the newsThe race for wealthy clients backfiresA Spac pioneer abruptly resigns News outlets dominate the headlines On Monday it felt like Fox News and CNN were vying for the biggest story. Unfortunately, all the drama was happening internally.  Shortly after Rupert Murdoch’s media group made an unexpected announcement that it had decided to part ways with its biggest star Tucker Carlson, CNN’s Don Lemon said he had been fired just hours after appearing on air.  Tucker Carlson is among the most-watched personalities in US television © Getty Images Both exits shocked the media world; neither Carlson nor Lemon had shown any indication during their shows that their time was up.   It’s difficult to overstate how much of an impact Carlson has had on Fox News. He was one of the most watched TV personalities in America and his show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, drew in more than 3mn viewers.  An indicator of Carlson’s effect on the American right (and perhaps on the left, as well) is a New York Times live blog dedicated solely to his exit.  So why would Fox break with its biggest rainmaker? The circumstances around Carlson’s departure are murky.  Fox just days ago agreed to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by voting-machine company Dominion over accusations it aired false theories about US election fraud, but Carlson wasn’t really a big part of the case.  Some have pointed to a pending lawsuit by former Fox staffer Abby Grossberg against Carlson himself, which alleges widespread discrimination at the network. Minutes after Fox released its terse statement on Carlson, Lemon broke the news of his own firing on Twitter, alleging that management had not bothered to tell him directly. Warner Bros Discovery-owned CNN disputed his account of events, saying that he was offered a meeting.   Lemon’s departure is perhaps a little more clear cut. He had made sexist comments about Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley, stating that she “isn’t in her prime”. According to Lemon, a woman is considered to be in her prime “in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s”. All of this unfolded about 24 hours after Jeff Shell, chief executive of NBCUniversal, said he was stepping down from his role. The statement on Sunday said Shell had engaged in “an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company” but on Monday NBC added there were allegations of sexual harassment which had been substantiated by an outside law firm hired to investigate the matter.  Meanwhile, BBC chair Richard Sharp finds himself in the hot seat after it emerged last week that he had been shown a report that he had made “significant errors of judgment” in failing to declare his role in an £800,000 personal loan secured by Boris Johnson shortly before the then prime minister recommended him for his position. Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker and friend of prime minister Rishi Sunak, had been shown the allegations against him under the so-called Maxwellisation process, whereby people criticised in an official report are shown the details in advance to allow them to respond. “It may be that Richard decides to jump before he is pushed,” said one person briefed on the draft report by Heppinstall.  And that’s not all in the world of media scandals. KKR-backed Axel Springer on Monday said it’s pursuing a criminal complaint and civil legal action against Julian Reichelt, a former editor of the tabloid Bild who was sacked for alleged misconduct.   The recent media storm comes as networks grapple with cost pressures, heavy debt loads and digital transformation. But even as things change, one rule of journalism always remains the case: never become the story. The thread connecting First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse What do First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse have in common? Expensive taste.  The trio spent decades bending over backwards to court wealthy clients. The thing about catering to the ultra-rich, though, is that they can be fickle. San Francisco-based First Republic had carved out a niche for itself reeling in cheap deposits to offer competitive rates on loans to wealthy clients. Its signature “white glove” customer service model, targeting well-to-do tech types not yet rich enough to get the same treatment at bigger rivals such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, banked on the idea that rich people rarely default on their loans.  Of the $332bn that First Republic lent out between its founding in 1985 and the first quarter of 2021, only 0.1 per cent went unpaid, about one-quarter of the loss ratio for a typical bank. But the California lender, already in the midst of a succession crisis when the Federal Reserve began cranking up interest rates in March 2022, was ill-equipped for the sharpest rise in US interest rates in more than four decades. After being salvaged in a $30bn rescue mission captained by US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, Fed chair Jay Powell and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, the bank reported a $72bn — or 40 per cent — drop in its deposits during the first three months of 2023. Silicon Valley Bank, on the other hand, didn’t live long enough to regret its reliance on venture capital firms and tech industry tycoons. (Its new owner First Citizens will hopefully consider its past mistakes.) Regulators now agree that SVB’s vulnerabilities were hiding in plain sight, according to this FT postmortem on the second-biggest US bank failure on record. “It is not just that the bank is taking outsized risk,” one short seller told the FT before the bank’s collapse. “It was a wealth management operation for the VC and PE industry.” Credit Suisse has also learnt the hard way that wealth management deposits aren’t as sticky as thought. On Monday, clients pulled $68.6bn from the bank in the days before Swiss regulators intervened. That deposit flight has also signalled consequences for the Swiss lender’s investment banking arm, Lex notes: as UBS boss Sergio Ermotti looks to stabilise Credit Suisse’s wealth management division, heavy cuts could be coming for investment banking. Those Credit Suisse investment bankers who aren’t already considering external job offers might well be updating their CVs. The curious case of Dominic Perks  Earlier this month London venture capitalist Dominic Perks resigned as chief of the investment firm Hambro Perks that still bears his name, as well as from the firm’s listed blank-cheque vehicle Hambro Perks Acquisition Company. The move was unexpected. One investor told the FT that they were surprised no further explanation was given other than that Perks offered his resignation with immediate effect. And despite declaring that it was continuing its search for a target just a couple weeks ago, HPAC announced plans on Monday to close up shop and return investors’ funds. Anthony Salz, the vehicle’s chair and a former senior partner at law firm Freshfields, chalked it up to tumultuous equity markets.  Left unmentioned was Perks’s mysterious exit. He had played a significant role at the investment group that he co-founded in 2013, serving as its chair and public face. He also led the launch of London’s first Spac following a government overhaul designed to help the UK’s markets compete with Wall Street.  Spacs have been on a tumultuous course since their pandemic boom. Another high-profile vehicle backed by LVMH founder Bernard Arnault and former UniCredit chief Jean Pierre Mustier also recently fell on its sword. But the blank-cheque misadventures of Hambro Perks — the former poster child of a new and improved UK listings regime — will be particularly painful given the market’s current slump.

"Bank of Japan stuns markets with yield control policy change","‘Major surprise’ sends yen roaring higher and pushes Tokyo stocks lower","The Bank of Japan caught investors by surprise with an unexpected change to a core tenet of its monetary policy, sending shockwaves across the currency, bond and equity markets. Traders described an adjustment to the longstanding yield curve control measures as potentially marking a “pivot” by the BoJ, the last of the world’s leading central banks to stick to an ultra-loose regime.  “We view this decision as a major surprise, as we had expected any widening of the tolerable band to be made under the new BoJ leadership from spring next year, similar to the market,” said Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs.  The yen jumped more than 4 per cent to about ¥131.2 against the US dollar in New York trading, while Japan’s Topix equity index fell 1.5 per cent. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield surged by its most in almost two decades, reaching a high of 0.47 per cent.  The BoJ’s move on Tuesday also ricocheted across other big markets: the US 10-year Treasury yield rose 0.11 percentage points to 3.69 per cent, while the equivalent UK gilt yield increased by a similar margin to 3.6 per cent. Yields rise when prices fall.  BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda denied the latest adjustment amounted to a tightening of monetary policy, stressing that the central bank would not scrap its yield target. Japan’s increasingly extreme outlier status has contributed to a huge fall in the yen this year as markets have priced in the differential with the rate-tightening US Federal Reserve. The central bank said it would allow 10-year bond yields to fluctuate by plus or minus 0.5 percentage points of its target of zero, instead of the previous band of plus or minus 0.25 percentage points. It kept overnight interest rates at minus 0.1 per cent.  Kuroda had earlier said any tweak to the yield curve control policy would effectively amount to an interest rate increase. But on Tuesday, he said the adjustment was meant to address increased volatility in global financial markets and improve bond market functioning to “enhance the sustainability of monetary easing”.  “This measure is not a rate hike,” Kuroda said. “Adjusting the YCC does not signal the end of YCC or an exit strategy.” Japan’s core inflation — which excludes volatile food prices — has exceeded the BoJ’s 2 per cent target for the seventh consecutive month, hitting a 40-year high of 3.6 per cent in October. But Kuroda had long argued that any tightening would be premature without robust wage growth, which is why most economists had expected the BoJ to stay the course until he steps down in April. On Tuesday, the central bank maintained its outlook that inflation would slow down next year and warned of “extremely high uncertainties” for the economy. “Maybe it’s an act of generosity by Kuroda to reduce the burden for the next BoJ governor, but it’s a dangerous move and market players feel duped,” said Masamichi Adachi, chief Japan economist at UBS. “US yields are falling now but if they start to rise again, the BoJ would once again face the risk of being pressured into raising rates.” The BoJ’s efforts to defend its YCC targets have contributed to a sustained reduction in market liquidity and what some analysts have described as “dysfunction” in the Japanese government bonds market. The central bank now owns more than half of outstanding bonds, compared with 11.5 per cent when Kuroda became governor in March 2013.  Kyohei Morita, chief Japan economist at Nomura Securities, said the BoJ’s move was probably best seen as a policy tweak rather than a full pivot. “Probably the BoJ wants to contribute to reducing the negative side effects of the yield curve control policy,” he said, noting that the bank’s outsized ownership of the Japanese government bonds market meant that liquidity had evaporated.  “They want to reactivate that market, even at the price of yen appreciation,” Morita said. Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore, said the BoJ’s move was significant because it signalled the central bank was considering a broader exit from YCC, adding it would be an important turning point for the yen. “The BoJ decision to raise interest rates in December 1989 led to a major sea change in Japanese markets,” said Mohi-uddin. “Today’s officials will be keenly aware of that history. It amplifies the significance of their signal to the markets today.” Benjamin Shatil, foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan, said the BoJ’s move would lead the market to start pricing in further policy moves, even if none were actually forthcoming.

"DWS blames ‘timing’ for its heavy ETF outflows this year","Many of Xtrackers’ European rivals have seen inflows over the same period","Latest news on ETFsVisit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools DWS has suffered near-record exchange traded fund outflows this year, even as the European industry as a whole attracted net inflows of almost €60bn. Xtrackers, DWS’s ETF business, had net outflows of €4.8bn between January and the end of October, according to Morningstar data. European ETFs overall had net inflows totalling €58.9bn over the same period. ETF providers are on course to have their lowest combined level of subscriptions in Europe since 2018, with DWS being the main drag on the sector.  DWS attributed its relatively poor sales to “timing”, saying the firm’s clients had started to reduce their allocations to equities in the first half of 2022, ahead of other ETF providers’ clients. This article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group. DWS said: “[Outflows were driven by] well-known global issues financial markets are facing”. “This risk-off movement became a topic for the ETF industry as a whole later on. The difference in timing is the main reason [for] the different flow patterns between Xtrackers ETFs and others.” The German asset manager’s ETF business has only twice experienced net outflows over a calendar year, Morningstar data suggest. The firm had net outflows of €4.9bn in 2016 and €4.4bn in 2013. Jose Garcia-Zarate, associate director of passive strategies at Morningstar, agreed that 2022 was “not proving a great year in flow terms for most ETF providers”. However, Garcia-Zarate was not convinced by the argument that the disparity in flows between DWS and other firms was “down to unfortunate timing”.  He said that while it was difficult to “pinpoint” a specific cause, accusations of greenwashing levelled against DWS, albeit for its actively managed funds, “may have put off some investors from investing in DWS funds irrespective of management style”. The former chief executive of DWS Group resigned in June after the company’s offices were raided by police following accusations of greenwashing, which it denies. Garcia-Zarate added that DWS had experienced outflows from its mainstream equity ETFs and inflows into its environmental, social and governance products, “though not in equal measure”. “But this pattern is something we have seen in other providers too this year,” he said. Many of Xtrackers’ largest peers have had net inflows to their European ETFs so far this year. BlackRock’s iShares is the best-selling firm, with inflows of €32.9bn, ahead of Vanguard with €9.1bn and Invesco with €6.4bn.  UBS and WisdomTree are among Europe’s 10 largest firms that have suffered redemptions, with net outflows of €1.5bn and €3.5bn respectively. Meanwhile, strong inflows to some smaller ETF providers have boosted their growth this year. ETF assets for JPMorgan Asset Management and Franklin Templeton have grown by almost 40 per cent each, while HanETF has grown by 20 per cent. Michael O’Riordan, founding partner of Blackwater Search and Advisory, said that for firms the size of JPMorgan and Franklin he “would expect nothing else” than healthy growth. “Both firms have really invested in their ETF business — and sooner or later that is going to pay off,” O’Riordan said. *Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

"GSK and Sanofi shares surge after Zantac ruling victory ","US judge dismisses almost 2,500 lawsuits alleging links between heartburn medication and cancer","Shares in GSK, Sanofi and Haleon soared on Wednesday as investors welcomed a victory in a legal case relating to a popular heartburn medication that had hung over the companies for months.  US district judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida on Tuesday dismissed thousands of lawsuits claiming that the drug Zantac causes cancer. She said the almost 2,500 lawsuits filed in federal court by plaintiffs were based on flawed science, and that the only reliable testing of the blockbuster drug undertaken showed an “unprovable risk of cancer”.  The ruling was a significant win for the pharmaceutical companies GSK, Pfizer, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim. Analysts said the ruling should remove a large portion of the potential liability linked to the Zantac litigation, which investors had feared could lead to tens of billions of dollars of personal injury awards if claimants had proved a link with cancer. About £30bn was wiped off the value of large pharmaceutical companies in early August following the publication of a note by investment bank UBS that flagged a “potential overhang” on Sanofi’s stock price because of the Zantac litigation. Morgan Stanley analysts had estimated damages could reach as high as $45bn. David Risinger, an analyst at SVB Securities, said the ruling appeared to be “a best-case scenario for the companies”. “While we can’t rule out appeals . . . or some state court litigation proceeding, the comprehensive dismissal by Judge Rosenberg of the plaintiffs’ arguments is compelling for the defendants,” he said.  The companies’ share prices have recovered to just below the level they were trading at in early August. Shares in GSK had surged 14 per cent in London early on Wednesday before the gains were pared back to 8 per cent, while Paris-listed Sanofi was up 6 per cent to €90.73.  Haleon also rose because investors had feared the £27bn UK-based consumer health company spun-off from GSK could be caught up in the lawsuits. Its shares rose 4 per cent to £3.07, slightly below the £3.08 at which the maker of Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers began trading independently in July.  Iain Simpson, analyst at Barclays, said that following the ruling “we regard Zantac as substantially derisked, leaving Haleon investible again for those without the appetite for pharma litigation risk”. The companies could still face thousands of similar personal injury cases filed in state courts, which are being litigated separately from the federal multi-district litigation in Florida. Zantac, which is the brand name for the drug ranitidine, has been sold by large pharmaceutical companies including GSK, Pfizer, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim over the past 35 years. Several smaller generic companies have also sold versions of the drug. The four defendants in the litigation denied that using Zantac led to an increased cancer risk and strongly criticised the credibility of a small independent lab that first raised concerns about the link between Zantac and cancer.   Rosenberg said there was no scientist outside the litigation who concluded that ranitidine caused cancer and said experts put forward by the plaintiffs had used unreliable methodologies to reach their conclusions. “The plaintiffs’ scientists within this litigation systemically utilised unreliable methodologies with a lack of documentation on how experiments were conducted, a lack of substantiation for analytical leaps, a lack of statistically significant data, and a lack of internally consistent, objective, science-based standards for the even-handed evaluation of data,” the judge wrote in the ruling, which ran to more than 300 pages.  Sanofi said it was “pleased” with the court’s decision and remained committed to its defence and the safety of Zantac. “This ruling significantly decreases the scope of the litigation potentially by over 50 per cent,” the French drugmaker added.  GSK said the ruling “ensured that unreliable and litigation-driven science did not enter the federal courtroom”. Brent Wisner, the co-lead liaison counsel for claimants in the Zantac California state litigation, said he was focused on pursuing the litigation in the state courts.  “We have our first trial scheduled for February 13 2023 in Oakland, California. I feel very confident about the science in our favour . . . Our clients are suffering from all types of cancers and deserve justice.” Additional reporting by Judith Evans in London","06.12.2022"
"EU to propose sanctions on Russia’s mining industry","Bloc aims for ban on investments in one of country’s biggest industries in effort to further cripple economy","The European Commission will propose a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow aimed at further eroding the country’s economy and the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. The mining investment ban, which will have exceptions for some specific products, is part of a ninth EU sanctions package that officials will discuss with member states in the coming days and aim to have agreed by the end of next week, three people with knowledge of the discussions told the Financial Times. Russia’s vast mining sector, a producer of commodities including gold, iron ore, uranium and phosphates, accounted for a quarter of foreign investment into the country before the Ukraine war, according to the Paris-based OECD.   The measure, if backed unanimously by the 27 EU states, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector, which it has previously avoided because of fears over the potential impact on global supply chains. Trading company Glencore owns a 10.55 per cent stake in EN+, which controls Russia’s largest aluminium producer. Global investors including BlackRock, Vanguard and UBS Asset Management hold stakes in major Russian mining companies including Norilsk Nickel and Evraz, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. The full EU sanctions package, which could be amended before implementation, includes export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals, the people said. The commission declined to comment. However, a senior EU official told a conference in Brussels that countries would have to widen sanctions to goods not traditionally used by Russia’s armed forces.  Denis Redonnet, chief enforcement officer of the commission, said: “Russia is adapting its war economy . . . to imports of lower-quality items, cannibalising lower-end technology.”   He said the EU had banned goods covering about 30 per cent of its €99bn annual pre-war exports to Russia.  Gary Nagle, Glencore chief executive, said on Tuesday the company would “continue to monitor and take any appropriate actions regarding sanctions” that might affect its assets.  He confirmed that Glencore still held its stake in EN+, describing it as a “passive shareholder” with “no board representation. Earlier this year, Glencore reviewed the investment, but “given the circumstances we were unable to exit that investment”, Nagle said.  The EU’s previous measures, along with those by the US, UK and other western allies, target scores of banks, defence companies, oil and gas producers and other critical parts of the country’s economy, as well as hundreds of government officials, oligarchs and propagandists. They have already helped to push Russia’s economy into recession.  The exact reach of the mining investment ban is still being defined, one of the people said, adding that it was likely to include derogations for certain products. Russia is a critical supplier to global markets of some metals such as titanium and palladium.  Other elements of the draft package include a ban on four Russian media channels that the EU says are used to promote Moscow propaganda, export controls on dual-use products worth more than €2.3bn and a ban on dealings with Russian marketing and market research companies.  The package, which has been drawn up after individual consultations between the commission and member state officials, will be discussed by ambassadors from the bloc’s 27 countries this week and, if necessary, at a summit of EU leaders that takes place next Thursday. Previous EU sanctions packages have required some horse-trading among member states and a watering-down of measures to secure the requisite unanimous approval.  Hungary, which has cultivated closer ties with Moscow than other EU members, has refused to endorse some elements of previous packages — such as a ban on Russian pipeline oil imports. Others have blocked efforts to bar imports of products used by their companies, such as Belgium’s refusal to support a ban on diamonds.

"Germany’s Uniper reports one of biggest losses in corporate history","Soon-to-be-nationalised energy group takes €40bn hit on gas price surge","Uniper has reported a €40bn loss, one of the biggest in corporate history, after Russia’s decision to limit European gas supplies pushed the soon-to-be-nationalised German energy group to the brink of collapse. Uniper, once Europe’s largest importer of Russian gas, is among the hardest-hit companies by the war in Ukraine, with its shares having plunged nearly 93 per cent this year. The company said on Thursday that net losses in the first nine months of the year had reached €40.4bn, against a €4.7bn loss recorded in the same period last year.   Soaring gas prices have forced Uniper to buy more expensively on the spot market after Moscow choked supplies to Europe. “To ensure customers’ supply security, Uniper has for some time been procuring gas at significantly higher prices and . . . has thus recorded considerable losses because the replacement costs of procuring new gas are not being passed through to consumers,” said Tiina Tuomela, chief financial officer. The war in Ukraine has plunged Uniper into crisis, with the company losing millions of euros every day.  Berlin said in September it would intervene with a €29bn bailout, amid fears a collapse of the country’s largest gas importer could spread devastating waves across Germany’s energy system and economy. “We and the federal government are currently finalising the details of the support measures,’‘ said Tuomela, adding that implementation of the “stabilisation package” was her “highest priority”. The German government’s intervention to save Uniper from insolvency will include buying out the group’s previous owner Fortum, an €8bn capital injection and a line of credit from state-owned KfW Bank totalling €18bn, of which Uniper said it had already drawn €14bn.  The €40.4bn figure for the first nine months comes close to full-year losses recorded by some of the worst-hit companies at the height of the financial crisis, including the $50bn loss reported by Freddie Mac in 2008. Uniper said the €40.4bn loss comprised “roughly €10bn of realised costs for replacement volumes, and roughly €31bn of anticipated future losses from valuation effects on derivatives and provision build-ups related to the Russian gas curtailments”. In the three months to the end of September, Uniper’s quarterly loss was almost €28bn.  Analysts at UBS said the figures revealed “further detail on the very large pressures facing the Uniper business”. The energy company’s share price sunk 3 per cent on Thursday morning, before recovering slightly to a drop just over 1 per cent. Net debt in the first nine months of the year jumped to €10.9bn, compared with €324mn last year. Revenues of €213bn were almost triple the €78bn in the same period last year. Tuomela said the company was “working intensively” to restructure its gas portfolio, with the aim to end losses related to suspended Russian gas deliveries before 2024.  “Uniper will play a key role in ensuring Germany’s supply of power and gas [this] winter and subsequent years,” she said, adding that the company was moving forward with the construction of Germany’s first LNG import terminal.","03.11.2022"
"Credit Suisse forecasts $1.6bn loss as wealthy clients withdraw funds","Bank bled about $89bn in fourth quarter, including 10% of wealth management assets","Credit Suisse has forecast a pre-tax loss of up to SFr1.5bn ($1.6bn) in the fourth quarter, with the Swiss bank reporting wealthy clients have withdrawn up to 10 per cent of assets since the start of October. In its fourth profit warning since January, the bank said the scale of the client outflows — which followed social media rumours about its financial health — had led the bank to dip into liquidity buffers at the group and legal entity level. Credit Suisse said it had “fallen below certain legal entity-level regulatory requirements”.  “Credit Suisse began experiencing deposit and net asset outflows in the first two weeks of October 2022 at levels that substantially exceeded the rates incurred in the third quarter of 2022,” the bank said in a statement.  The wealth management division has suffered outflows equivalent to 10 per cent of assets under management at the end of the third quarter, about SFr63.5bn, it added. Across the group, the bank bled roughly SFr84bn ($89bn) of assets, as wealth management, asset management and retail banking customers switched their cash holdings, investments and deposits to rivals. JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein warned “Credit Suisse is not out of the woods yet in terms of stabilising the franchise”.  “Wealth management outflows at 10 per cent of assets under management in the fourth quarter (until 11 November) are very material at a level seen by UBS in the global financial crisis on an annualised basis and not in one quarter.” The bank’s shares fell 6 per cent in trading on Wednesday to SFr3.62, its lowest price for at least 30 years, having dropped 60 per cent this year. More than 90 per cent of Credit Suisse shareholders voted in favour of the bank raising SFr4bn from investors, including the Saudi National Bank, to help pay for a radical restructuring of the group at an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Wednesday morning.  “This vote marks an important step in building our new Credit Suisse,” said chair Axel Lehmann. The Swiss bank said earlier on Wednesday that its wealth management division was likely to post a loss after net interest income took a hit from lower deposits and fees.  It also expects the investment bank to make a significant pre-tax loss after what it described as a “substantial industry-wide slowdown in capital markets”. “The massive net outflows in wealth management — Credit Suisse’s core business alongside the Swiss bank — are deeply concerning, even more so as they have not yet reversed,” said Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti. “The resulting significant assets under management decline will reduce our revenue and long-term profit estimates. Credit Suisse needs to restore trust as fast as possible — but that is easier said than done,” he added. The bank also confirmed its capital ratio guidance issued last month, targeting a common equity tier one ratio — a reflection of financial resilience — of more than 13.5 per cent by 2025 and of at least 13 per cent from 2023 to 2025.  However, it revealed its liquidity capital ratio — which indicates its ability to withstand short-term stress — had fallen from 192 per cent at the end of September to a daily average of 140 per cent since. Regulators require the bank to stay above 100 per cent. Last month, the bank announced its restructuring plan, including carving up and spinning off its investment bank, cutting thousands of jobs and raising $4bn in capital, to help it move on from scandals and a SFr4bn third-quarter loss. It expected to record a SFr75mn loss on the disposal of its stake in Allfunds Group, the bank added. Credit Suisse: what next for the crisis-hit bank? | FT Film ","23.11.2022"
"Bank of England’s stance on QE may have added to high inflation, says Pill","Chief economist admits repeated rounds of pandemic support could have worsened overshoot of 2% target","The Bank of England’s chief economist has admitted that the central bank’s decisions to prolong quantitative easing in the coronavirus pandemic may have contributed to the past year’s surge in inflation. Giving evidence to the House of Lords’ economic affairs committee on Tuesday, Huw Pill said the UK’s double-digit inflation largely resulted from the increase in wholesale gas prices in Europe, although there was a risk of high inflation becoming more persistent.  But he added that decisions taken by the BoE before he joined its Monetary Policy Committee — including repeated rounds of quantitative easing over the course of the pandemic — could have worsened the central bank’s overshoot of its 2 per cent target.   The stock of assets held by the BoE — mostly government bonds — stood at £445bn at the start of the pandemic and had doubled to £895bn by the end of 2021 following three successive rounds of QE announced in 2020.  Global factors — including US fiscal support to households that boosted international goods prices — also played a part, Pill argued. He said it was “an open question” whether some of those choices would have been made with hindsight, adding: “One could say the destruction of demand was overemphasised relative to the destruction of supply . . . That probably meant support for demand was stronger than it should have been.” Pill’s comments, made in response to a question from the former BoE governor Mervyn King, are the first admission from an official at the central bank that its choices have contributed to the current squeeze on living standards.  Critics have accused the bank of fuelling inflation by pumping money into the economy and being too slow to raise interest rates in the first upswing after lockdowns were lifted. But Pill pushed back against King’s suggestion that the BoE’s decision last week to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points to 3 per cent was still nowhere near sufficient to control inflation. Price rises reached 10.1 per cent in September, far above the bank’s 2 per cent target.  He said the BoE’s latest forecasts showed clearly that policymakers were likely to continue raising interest rates at future meetings, while also signalling that recent market expectations for the benchmark rate to reach 5.25 per cent next year had been overdone.  “I would say and my colleagues would say there is more to do . . . There is more to come,” he told the committee, reiterating the message he delivered on Tuesday morning at a conference held by the bank UBS. At the conference, Pill did not say how much further interest rates had to rise but insisted another tightening of monetary policy would be needed to ensure that companies did not continue raising prices and that workers moderated wage demands. These are known as second-round effects in an inflationary period. “I think we cannot declare victory against second-round effects, but we are entering a recession. That’s a difficult trade-off environment for monetary policy,” Pill said. “What we’re most concerned about is whether this self-sustaining inflation will persist,” he added. Pill moderated these hawkish remarks by noting that the BoE would still have to digest the effects of the chancellor’s Autumn Statement on November 17, which is likely to raise taxes and cut public spending.","08.11.2022"
"Lansdowne Partners and Marshall Wace: a tale of two hedge funds","How the London firms diverged in a Darwinian tale of performance, succession and strategy","Born a year apart a quarter of a century ago, Lansdowne Partners and Marshall Wace struck out on the same path, using fundamental analysis to buy and sell European equities.  Now the London hedge funds are very different animals. Lansdowne has struggled to diversify beyond its flagship fund, hamstrung by a static ownership structure that limits incentives for new hires. Assets under management have plunged by two-thirds from a 2015 peak of $21bn and it has shifted from high-margin hedge funds to a long-only business commanding a fraction of the fees. Marshall Wace, meanwhile, has carved out a position as Europe’s answer to US industry giants Citadel or Millennium Management. Assets under management have swelled to a record $63bn, an anomaly among the region’s equities hedge funds that have largely retrenched. And a dynamic partnership structure has ensured retiring partners make way for the next generation.  The Financial Times spoke to more than a dozen top insiders, investors and rivals about how the firms’ fortunes came to diverge in a Darwinian tale of performance, succession and strategy.  Their trajectories provide a microcosm of the hedge fund sector’s evolution from a cottage industry of boutique managers to a handful of big names running diversified, sophisticated and technologically driven businesses. They also serve as case studies on the need to keep innovating, on whether hedge funds can or should outlast their founders — and on how past performance is no guarantee of future success.  “Like a lot of fund managers, people might be clever and good at investing,” said one investor. “But they’re not always good at getting the strategy of their own firm right.”  The firms in numbersLansdowneMarshall WaceFounded19981997Current AUM$7bn$63bnPeak AUM$21bn (2015)$63bn (2023)Number of employees70550Number of partners1133Offices globallyOneFiveExternal shareholderMorgan Stanley IM (19 per cent)KKR (40 per cent)Source: Lansdowne, Marshall Wace, investors

			  In 2017 Lansdowne began discussions with BlackRock head of European credit Michael Phelps over whether the London firm might be able to bring his team on board to launch a credit fund, according to several people familiar with the talks.  It would have been a big departure for Lansdowne, which had carved out a reputation as the gold standard in equity investing, led by portfolio managers Peter Davies and Stuart Roden, who had cut their teeth at Mercury Asset Management.  The cerebral pair, who managed Lansdowne’s flagship UK fund that was later rebranded as the developed markets fund, had prospered by knowing the companies in which they invested inside-out. Chief executives sometimes even cited them as understanding their businesses better than they did themselves.    But the top decision makers at Lansdowne could not agree on its own strategy. While it had launched several other funds over the years, the developed markets fund — a long/short equity strategy that bets individual stocks will either rise or fall — still dominated the firm, accounting for about 80 per cent of its assets and even more of its profit.  Roden, who stopped running money in 2016 to focus on the business, told investors a foray into credit would help diversify the firm and bring on a new generation of talent. But a deal was never struck, with Roden unable to convince its retired founders and controlling shareholders Sir Paul Ruddock and Steven Heinz to dilute their share of Lansdowne to incentivise a new team, according to the people familiar with the talks.  Sir Paul Ruddock, 64, retired co-founder, LansdowneLansdowne is named after Ruddock’s street in Holland Park, from where he co-founded it. His Rolodex of clients helped turn Lansdowne into an institutional business from day one. A prominent patron of the arts, Ruddock is chair of Oxford University Endowment Management and a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Phelps left BlackRock and in 2019 set up Tresidor Capital Management in one of the more successful European hedge fund launches of recent years, securing $200mn in seed capital from alternatives giant Blackstone and growing to $2.2bn in assets with double-digit annualised returns since then, according to an investor.  Roden left the firm in September 2018 to “pursue other interests”, joining Tresidor as chair the following year. Investors say he was open about the reason for his departure: frustration that attempts to diversify the firm had not come to fruition.  His exit coincided with the $21bn peak of the firm’s assets under management and was followed by a period of mixed performance, investor outflows and organisational upheaval.  Founded in 1998, Lansdowne enjoyed early success as it grew with the European hedge fund industry. By the time it sold a 19 per cent stake to Morgan Stanley Investment Management in November 2006, it was managing $12bn across five different investment strategies: European equities, UK equities, global financials, macro, and emerging markets.   It further cemented its reputation during the 2007-08 financial crisis, when Davies and Roden’s UK equities fund profited from lucrative short positions in financials and housebuilders. They then turned positive on equities and caught the market rebound, ending 2009 up 25.6 per cent. But the run did not last. The UK equities fund lost 20.1 per cent in 2011 after it was hurt by its long positions in financials. In April 2012 it was renamed the Lansdowne Developed Markets fund to reflect its wider remit.  After Ruddock retired in June 2013 and Heinz stepped back from day-to-day activities the following year, they kept their large ownership stakes and remained Lansdowne’s controlling shareholders, paving the way for some of its later challenges.   “You can’t manage a successful organisation with that percentage of the economics going to non-producing owners,” said one rival.  Peter Davies, 51, partner and head of developed markets strategy, LansdowneCerebral and measured, Davies’ priority is the intellectual pursuit of managing investments rather than building a business. Best man to former chancellor George Osborne, he used to sit on the board of Oxford Sciences Innovation, which commercialises intellectual property, and is now a non-executive director of Nattergal, a project to recover global biodiversity. “Lansdowne has never grown away from Pete,” said one investor. Lansdowne appointed Alex Snow, founder of UK stockbroker Evolution, as chief executive in September 2013. He brought on Per Lekander, a portfolio manager from UBS and Norges Bank Investment Management, and a team to launch an energy fund.  But within three years Snow had left in an exit also linked to frustration at not being able to expand the firm, he told investors.  “Snow was told to make Lansdowne a bigger asset manager but he was never fully empowered to do that,” one said. Snow’s departure was followed by the closure of Lansdowne’s financials hedge fund. And in July 2020 the firm announced it was closing the flagship developed markets fund after a long period of poor performance. About half its investors converted to the long-only strategy, which has gained 43 per cent since then. The following year Lekander — once Lansdowne’s great hope for rebuilding its hedge fund business — left to launch his own firm, Clean Energy Transition. CET gained 19 per cent last year, is down a small amount this year, and has grown to manage $2.7bn, according to investors. Lansdowne’s struggles are symptomatic of an existential crisis that has beset the long/short equity sector. The rise of passive investing has made it more likely that stocks move in packs, making it harder to pick winners and losers, as well as offering a cheaper alternative to actively managed portfolios. The dominance of large US tech companies has meant markets are increasingly driven by a handful of stocks. And a protracted bull market since the financial crisis, turbocharged by central bank stimulus, has made “shorts” — betting on falling prices — more difficult. Stuart Roden, 60, retired chair, LansdowneDescribed by one investor as “a proper business brain” who commands loyalty from those around him, Roden has focused on philanthropic efforts since retiring from Lansdowne five years ago. Among them he is chair of social mobility charity UP: Unlocking Potential and incoming chair of the Design Museum. In the past couple of years, peers including Adelphi Capital and Sloane Robinson have thrown in the towel while others such as Egerton Capital and Pelham Capital are running smaller hedge fund businesses than before.  A person close to Lansdowne acknowledged that it had not sufficiently evolved. Once again trying to grow its business and reduce dependence on the developed markets fund, it announced the purchase last month of long-only boutique Crux Asset Management.  The acquisition, for which financial terms were not disclosed, is partly aimed at catalysing the evolution of Lansdowne’s ownership structure, the person close to the firm said. “Over time more of the firm’s equity needs to be in the hands of the current portfolio managers and management.” Between them Davies, Ruddock and Heinz still own 55 per cent of the firm. Morgan Stanley will retain its 19 per cent stake in Lansdowne and Arkansas-based financial services company Stephens, which last year bought a minority stake in Crux, will transfer its stake to Lansdowne and increase it to 9 per cent. Lansdowne sees its future in three main revenue streams: its traditional institutional client base, a more recent push into the wealth market, and expanding its hedge fund servicing business where it provides middle and back office services to other managers. It has about $6bn in assets under administration in the servicing business, including Lekander’s Clean Energy Transition, with which it has a profit share, and Patrick Degorce’s Theleme Partners. “This is a special place built on 25 years of investing patiently in equities and doing so against consensus, transparently and with high conviction,” managing partner Brian Heyworth told the FT. “There is a great group of people here across the whole firm. We think the opportunities available outside of the familiar US large caps are really compelling.”  Marshall Wace was set up by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace in 1997 with $50mn in assets, some of which came from Hungarian-born financier George Soros. Marshall was ex-Mercury while Wace had worked at SG Warburg then Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.  “The best thing we ever did was recognise that Paul’s interest was in markets and my interest was in business-building, and that we allowed each other to develop in those spaces,” Wace told the FT in a rare interview. “A defining characteristic of Marshall Wace is that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about how to build this business . . . that’s really, really important in building a definable competitive advantage.” The pair did not start with a grand plan and their strategy has kept evolving, he said, through “constantly sitting there thinking . . . how do you do it? We never had analysis paralysis. We were always pretty ambitious to try to invest in the business systems, processes, controls.” Paul Marshall, 64, co-founder, Marshall WaceThe former Mercury fund manager is “very driven”, says one acquaintance, and believes that “money is a way to change the world”. Marshall stepped back from the firm from 2005 to 2008 to focus on politics and philanthropy but is now back on the front line. A Brexit supporter, he funded political news website UnHerd. A crucial development came in 2002 with the invention of Trade Optimised Portfolio System (Tops), a proprietary trading system developed by Anthony Clake that analyses buy and sell recommendations from about 1,000 external analysts. The concept is known as “alpha capture” and the flagship Tops fund is market neutral — generating returns uncorrelated with equity markets.  These strategies keep evolving. “You will never ever be successful mining spent ground,” said Wace. The Tops Market Neutral fund is up 2.88 per cent this year and has recorded an average annualised gain of 9.31 per cent since its November 2007 inception. Marshall’s Eureka fund, which accounts for about a third of the firm’s assets, is flat this year but has delivered average annualised gains of 11.9 per cent since its 1997 launch, according to investors.  Ian Wace, 60, co-founder, Marshall Wace“Independent thinker, detail-oriented and savvy” is how one acquaintance describes Wace, who did not go to university and became SG Warburg’s youngest ever director, aged 25. He was on the other side of the Brexit referendum to Marshall, with whom he co-founded the Absolute Return for Kids charity more than two decades ago. A natural leader, Wace led a campaign during the pandemic to provide meals for the NHS.  Tops has been the linchpin for Marshall Wace’s quantitative business, which has added scale to the firm and allowed it to diversify beyond its roots in fundamental equities. Two-thirds of its $63bn in assets is run in systematic strategies that use computer algorithms, about a third of its 550 or so employees work in technology-related roles and the firm spends tens of millions of dollars a year on technology.  “In order to try and access these systematic businesses, the first thing is the idea but the other thing is how do you actually optimise and execute that idea,” said Wace. “When you see that competitive advantage, invest in it. But the devil is in that execution.”  As Marshall Wace grew, it also distributed ownership of the company more widely among key personnel. “The root of our success has been partnership,” said Wace. It counts 33 partners and when one retires their holding is diluted to a smaller stake, with the rest of the shares purchased and redistributed.  “Lansdowne and Marshall Wace are two polar opposites,” said one investor. “Marshall and Wace have said that they’re happy to be a smaller shareholder in a bigger group to incentivise the next generation.”  Anthony Clake, 43, partner, Marshall WaceMarshall Wace’s secret weapon has worked for the firm his entire career. Alongside Marshall and Wace, Clake is one of the three largest individual shareholders in the business, recognition of his contribution to the development of Tops, the firm’s proprietary alpha capture trading system. Marshall Wace suffered a near-death experience in 2008 when clients pulled their money and assets plunged from $14bn to $3.95bn in three months, heralding soul searching about the shape of the business.   “When you watch a horrendously large percentage of your assets disappear out of the door within an extraordinarily short period of time, you vow that you would never allow this to happen,” said Wace. This meant rethinking liquidity and fee structures, extending funding terms and increasing the portion of US institutions and sovereign wealth funds in its client base.  As part of the push to stabilise the business, Marshall Wace sold a 24.9 per cent stake to KKR in September 2015. The alternatives giant has since increased its holding to 39.9 per cent and during their partnership Marshall Wace’s assets under management have almost tripled. Wace said the KKR deal “focused the mind of the partners about the value of partnership, and it focused the investors on the value of investment”. “I think when you build a business, what you try to do is to build people who build a business,” said Wace. “You don’t build a business, it’s all about people.”","14.06.2023"
"Investors’ Chronicle: Antofagasta, Hays, Smith & Nephew","Companies analysis from our sister publication","BUY: Antofagasta (ANTO) Facing record comparators from 2021, the Chilean miner saw underlying earnings fall and it slashed its dividend in response, writes Alex Hamer. Following a golden year is never easy. Copper miner Antofagasta has landed an almost $1bn (£830mn) bonus to throw onto its reported profits for the 2022 financial year, but underlying numbers have seen a significant slide on 2021, when copper prices were high and costs low.  For the year ending December 31, the company saw its underlying cash profit fall almost 40 per cent to $2.9bn (£2.4bn) as copper prices fell from 2021 highs and production of copper, gold and molybdenum fell. Net costs also climbed a third on the year before, to $1.61 per pound of copper. Guidance for this year is slightly higher again, at $1.65 per pound, although chief executive Iván Arriagada said input prices were already coming down.  Antofagasta has cut its dividend by half, sticking to its policy of handing back 100 per cent of underlying profits per share. The final payout of 50.5¢ compares with 118.9¢ a year ago.  There were several factors behind the difficult profit numbers, on top of the lower price. Overall production was down 10 per cent to 646,000 tonnes, contributing to almost $1bn of the $1.9bn cash profit fall. The lower prices were responsible for a $644mn reduction in earnings, and mining costs covered the rest of the decline.  Production will not immediately spring back to its 2021 level — guidance for this year is 670,000-710,000 tonnes, compared with 721,000 tonnes in 2021. Antofagasta’s significant capital spending in recent years will start to bear fruit, however. “We see growth coming in the short term and the longer term,” Arriagada said. RBC Capital Markets forecasts a return to previous levels next year. The $945mn one-off gain is for its stake in a Pakistan copper mine that has spent years in development hell. An arbitration panel awarded Antofagasta and its joint venture partner Barrick Gold $5.8bn in 2019 because Pakistan’s government denied them a mining lease in 2011, but Barrick has held on to its stake (in return for giving up the potential payment), and will develop the mine in partnership with a state body.  Arriagada said the board would consider what to do with the cash once it arrives.  The company is now at the end of a major capex programme, in which it built a desalination plant for the Los Pelambres mine, as well as added processing capacity. But spending is expected to remain around this elevated level for some time. The company forecast $1.9bn in capex for this year, while consensus forecasts put 2024 capital spending at $2.2bn.   The signs are pointing to a stronger copper market this year than initially forecast, given the supply disruptions in Chile and elsewhere. Antofagasta is well placed to capitalise on this, even if the recent share price run means it is one of the most expensive miners at a valuation of 29 times forward earnings.  HOLD: Hays (HAS) The recruiter started the year with too many consultants and too little work, writes Jemma Slingo. Recruitment companies were riding high in the aftermath of the pandemic, fuelled by labour shortages, wage inflation and the “Big Quit”. To make the most of booming demand, all the big listed players took on more consultants, confidently declaring that it was “just the beginning of the great reshuffle”.  A few months down the line, however, and the situation has changed. In its half-year results, Hays reported an 8 per cent fall in operating profit to £97mn, in spite of record fees. This was primarily due to high staff costs: the group entered the financial year with headcount up 26 per cent, and like-for-like costs rose by 16 per cent in the period, driven by wages — which had been increased — and consultant commission. Management said it “actively managed” the situation and reduced headcount in the second quarter in several markets, including in the UK, China and the US. This was achieved through attrition as opposed to redundancies, according to the group. The next six months should be easier, therefore, and second-half profits are expected to be higher.  However, the economic backdrop is still gloomy and the group noted a decline in volume of work. So far, this has been more than offset by wage inflation, as Hays tends to charge a percentage fee per placement, based on employee salary. How long wage inflation will persist remains to be seen, however.  Hays has also announced that chief executive Alistair Cox will be stepping down after 15 years at the helm, which could add to the short-term turbulence. HOLD: Smith & Nephew (SN.)  The medical device manufacturer has increased its ambition in the hope of shaking its reputation as an underperformer, writes Jennifer Johnson. There were no nasty surprises lurking in Smith & Nephew’s 2022 results. But nor was there a great deal for investors to celebrate. Revenue was flat — though this had largely been anticipated — and shrinking margins ate into profits. The medical technology group is currently striving to break a pattern of underperformance, with management introducing a 12-point plan for growth last year. As the group progresses through the two-year life of the plan, chief executive Deepak Nath said it expects “further operational and financial benefits, including a reduction in inventory levels and cash conversion to return to historic levels”. However, short-term success will largely be determined by factors outside of the company’s control.  Trading profit margins shrunk to 17.3 per cent in 2022 — down from 18 per cent the year before. The decline was blamed on inflation in freight and logistics costs, as well as China’s volume-based procurement (VBP) scheme. The programme is designed to lower the cost of medical consumables by tendering large swaths of its medical devices market to the manufacturer that offers the lowest price.     For the 2023 financial year, Smith & Nephew is targeting revenue growth and trading profit margins above last year’s levels. Its 2025 guidance is more bullish still — with management aiming for profit margin expansion to “at least” 20 per cent. According to analysts at UBS, this implies 125 basis points (bp) of margin expansion in each of the next two years. “The company has only delivered 100bp or more three times since 2006 and those were years immediately post the financial crisis . . . or immediately post Covid,” they wrote in a 21 February note.  Much depends on the group’s ability to turn its key orthopaedics division around. By its own admission, this part of the business has been hobbled by “poor operational systems and commercial execution”. One of the major objectives of the 12-point plan is to regain lost momentum in hip and knee implants.  There is some evidence of progress, with Smith & Nephew reducing its number of overdue orders by 35 per cent from its peak in the first half of last year. Investors are also hoping that some new faces in senior management will help to drive the company’s transformation. Nath is only a year into his tenure, and it was announced this week that former Serco chief executive Rupert Soames will step in as chair. Shares currently trade at roughly 15 times expected 2024 earnings, making Smith & Nephew a relative bargain in the medical tech field. But with so much uncertainty surrounding its overhaul, we’d say that constitutes fair value.","24.02.2023"
"Credit Suisse First Boston 2.0: what could possibly go right?","The bottom-of-the-cycle timing might be right for an independent investment bank ","Credit Suisse has secured rights to the name “First Boston” in its push to spin off its investment bank. Can the new CS First Boston recapture the glories of the original? Wall Street financier Michael Klein, who will lead the unit, aims to reboot a brand that was once big on Wall Street and in the City of London. He may not wish to revive the corporate culture. I knew CSFB back in the late eighties and early nineties. The atmosphere in the scruffy London office was of acrid aggression, with none of the blokery of BZW or Morgan Stanley’s élan. CSFB executives forsook their trading screens for press interviews with martyred expressions. The eminence grise of the place complained bitterly when one magazine reported that underlings called him “Alf” behind his back. This stood for Arrogant Little Fucker, supposedly. The banker cornered the red-faced editor. “I am not little!” he raged. CSFB was a formidable capital markets operator, thanks to First Boston’s Wall Street footprint and Credit Suisse’s wealthy, secretive European client base. That points to two parallels with CSFB 2.0. First, the business would probably generate the majority of its revenue in the US, while retaining a foothold in Europe. Second, CSFB ancient and modern would have a penchant for supporting leveraged US transactions.  The business took hefty losses as US corporate debt spun out of control at the end of the eighties. Credit Suisse’s US arm stayed true to its junk bond roots, re-emerging as a key financier of buyouts after the financial crisis. Private equity bosses are currently twiddling their thumbs while wondering who will write down portfolio values most. For this reason, bankers I straw polled on the prospects for the new CSFB mostly said of the timing: “This seems like a dreadful idea.”  My feeling is that the timing might be very good indeed — if you are Michael Klein. He plans to merge his Wall Street boutique into CSFB, which would keep a substantial stake. The erstwhile Credit Suisse board member has provoked justifiable criticism for identifying the best candidate to split off and run CSFB in his own shaving mirror. More to the point, the bottom of the market looks like a sensible place to sink financial and personal capital into an independent investment bank. Credit Suisse is expected to contribute risk-weighted assets to the tune of $21bn. It will not be picky on the implicit valuation of these in any transaction to raise external equity. Within the Credit Suisse group, the investment bank is valued at approximately zero by the market. The Swiss lender has been drifting chaotically in the wake of the Greensill and Archegos scandals. Its shares trade at 0.2 times tangible book value, an 80 per cent discount to sometime comparator UBS. The latter enjoys a high valuation partly because it scaled back its investment bank years ago. Belatedly, Credit Suisse is doing the same. Not all of Klein’s projects have worked out. His Multiplan special purpose acquisitions company for healthcare triggered an ugly legal dispute, for example. But he knows plenty of big-name investors who could give the CSFB spin-off higher credibility. Around $500mn is already in the bag. More will be needed.  Big US investment groups such as Apollo, Blackstone, KKR or TPG might be interested. A distressed seller is always a lure. It may be possible to frame the CSFB deal as a partial buyout, with an initial public offering or trade sale as a lure a few years down the track. IPO prospects would help Klein recruit and retain good bankers, substituting sweat equity for big bonuses the business could not afford. Jefferies analyst Flora Bocahut calculates that the ratio of cost to income would need to fall to 85 per cent. In the third quarter, it was an eye-watering 160 per cent. US-listed independent investment banks are hardly a novelty. They include Evercore, Lazards and Moelis and are typically worth around $4bn on annual revenues of some $2bn-$3bn. CSFB might hope to join that group, albeit that, like Jefferies, it would take balance sheet risks.  There are a couple of big obstacles. First, trading would stay within the Swiss bank after primary markets had decamped. That would be a very odd division. Second, Credit Suisse might decide some time after a split that funding a bunch of high-maintenance financiers was not the best use of spare cash. Neither problem is insuperable. But overcoming them would take ingenuity and bloody-mindedness. In that respect, the pugnacious spirit of the old CSFB might prove very useful to the new CSFB, after all. jonathan.guthrie@ft.com","12.12.2022"
"Chinese property stocks soar on hopes of turning point for sector","Financial measures from Beijing offer relief for cash-strapped developers struggling to complete projects","Shares and bonds in Chinese real estate companies rose sharply on Monday as a sweeping plan by Beijing to support the property market was interpreted as a critical moment in arresting the decline of the debt-ridden sector.  The Hang Seng Mainland Properties index closed 13 per cent higher in Hong Kong. Shares in Country Garden, one of China’s biggest developers, gained more than 36 per cent, while several of the group’s dollar bonds surged nearly 50 per cent.  Details of the 16-point plan from the People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission were reported by the Financial Times on Sunday.   The key changes include extending a year-end deadline for lenders to cap their ratio of property sector loans, and the extension of outstanding trust borrowings. The changes, which could affect more than a quarter of China’s total banking loans, mean lenders now have beyond the end of this year to cap the portion of their outstanding property loans. The extension was viewed as one of the strongest moves by Beijing to relieve pressure from the credit crunch roiling the industry, by giving lenders and cash-strapped real estate developers breathing space as they fight to survive the country’s historic property sector downturn. The package marks the latest sign of Beijing backpedalling on its property sector reforms amid fears of a credit crash and social instability. China’s property sector meltdown has spread from developer defaults and slumping apartment sales to batter the coffers of local governments and risk contagion across the financial sector. There have also been signs of rising social instability after hundreds of thousands of would-be apartment owners this year boycotted mortgage payments across nearly 100 cities.  One bond trader for a US investment bank in Hong Kong said that while the joint statement signalled more policy easing in the aftermath of President Xi Jinping securing an unprecedented third five-year term in power last month, “its effectiveness remains to be seen”. “It said property developers’ outstanding bank loans and trust borrowings due within the next six months can be extended for a year while the repayment on their bonds can also be extended. However, the condition of such an extension is based on banks’ assessment of the solvency of the debt,” the trader said.  The Chinese market has been stunned by a rising number of defaults and hurried asset sales by developers over the past year. The pace of new loans and total social financing has also retreated faster than expected, amid sluggish demand. A Hong Kong-based bond trader with a Chinese state bank pointed out that the rebound in developer bonds followed a bout of heavy selling, and added that the rebound was limited to those with investment-grade ratings.  Still, the new plan dovetails with the expansion of a programme to help developers sell more onshore renminbi bonds and ease their liquidity woes. Also on Monday, the banking regulator said developers could have access to more money held in presale accounts with guarantee letters from banks, further easing liquidity pressure on developers.  “Together with the previous Rmb250bn ($35bn) bond sale programme support, we view this may mark a turning point for the property sector, as the government is turning to support developers on top of supporting industry,” said UBS analysts in a note. Citi said the changes were akin to “blessed rains” after a long drought. As the first comprehensive set of measures from the PBoC and CBIRC the plan “could be a game-changer . . . unlike previous piecemeal steps”, the bank’s analysts said. Nomura analysts said: “Cash-strapped developers (especially private ones), construction companies, mortgage borrowers and other related stakeholders can now breathe a sigh of relief.”","14.11.2022"

Crossbridge Energy Partners, with the financial backing of commodity trader Vitol, is negotiating an agreement with Lukoil that would value the Sicily-based ISAB refinery at between €1bn-€1.5bn.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: SBF explains himselfWall Street’s new day-trading hobbyNestlé’s dealmaking regrets FTX: IOU’s are as good as money For weeks, DD has been trying to conceptualise the spiralling mess at FTX.  Here’s where we’re at: it’s Dumb and Dumber meets Lord of the Flies.  Let us explain. There’s a central problem for the creditors hoping for a recovery from the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. The company’s young employees spent valuable resources like drunken sailors, but much of what’s left behind are speculative IOUs in the form of illiquid crypto tokens. The FT’s Nikou Asgari and Joshua Oliver report on the culture inside FTX, where a lack of internal controls meant that spending went largely unchecked. FTX’s employees paid hundreds of millions of dollars for property in the Bahamas where the firm was located, $135mn for naming rights to a Miami basketball stadium and even racked up a $55,319 tab at the Margaritaville Beach Resort in Nassau. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried speaks during the New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday © Getty Images “[It was] kids leading kids,” said one former employee. “The entire operation was idiotically inefficient, but equally mesmerising,” they added. “I had never witnessed so much money in my life. I don’t think anybody had, including SBF.”  Ultimately, the company once valued at $32bn operated in a manner befitting of the children lampooned in William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, albeit with far more cash. “It just kinda went crazy,” said one employee. After the spending binge, which included massive political contributions and billions spent on acquisitions and investments in venture funds and start-ups, there’s not much cash left. FTX had less than $1bn in liquid assets against nearly $9bn in liabilities and a negative $8bn entry described as “hidden, poorly internally labled ‘fiat@’ account”, the FT reported in November. Much of what remains are tokens such as Serum and FTT of questionable worth. One valuable asset is a 7.6 per cent stake in online trading company Robinhood.  The problem is bankrupt cryptocurrency lender BlockFi claims it is the rightful owner of the stake and is suing SBF to seize shares it says he pledged as collateral just days before his exchange collapsed. SBF included the Robinhood shares on FTX balance sheets presented to potential rescue investors and even privately negotiated to sell the shares on Signal, according to messages seen by the FT.  The situation is reminiscent of the 1994 comedy Dumb and Dumber.  ‘Dumb and Dumber’  Characters played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels find a suitcase filled with cash and go on a spending spree, buying Lamborghinis and ugly suits, as they try to return it. They credit their spending with IOUs. “That’s as good as money, sir. Those are IOUs. Go ahead and add it up, every cent’s accounted for,” says Carrey’s character Lloyd Christmas. On Wednesday, SBF used the New York Times’ Dealbook conference to explain himself, stating he “never tried to commit fraud” while admitting he made “a lot of mistakes”. Ultimately, SBF took the Lloyd Christmas approach. “There are a lot of assets that are on hand here, though many are not liquid . . . I think there is a shot for real value.” One prominent onlooker found it convincing. “Call me crazy, but I think @sbf is telling the truth,” tweeted hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman. Dawn of the day traders Trading in meme-stocks may have died down, but there’s a new casino game attracting interest on Wall Street. Professional traders are diving into so-called zero-day options, derivative contracts that are bought or sold on the day they expire, DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Nicholas Megaw report. The surging volumes — now accounting for more than two-fifths of daily trading in S&P 500 index options — have captured the attention of trading desks, not least because some believe the derivatives are contributing to recent wild swings in stock markets.  One thing to get out of the way before we go further: the name “zero-day options” can be confusing given the actual derivatives being traded are weekly contracts that are bought or sold on the day that they expire (ie there are “zero days” until they expire). The trading shift was spurred by new products from exchange operator Cboe Global Markets. In an attempt to capitalise on the boom in options trading, it launched new weekly options on the S&P 500 index that expire on Tuesdays and Thursdays, joining the pre-existing products that expire on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The new set of days means investors can trade large sums of options that mature each day of the week — including as zero-day options when they’re on the cusp of expiry.  So why does it matter? The jump in options trading could be contributing to the wild intraday market swings registered this year. Market makers that sell options contracts will hedge their positions to avoid making a bet on the market’s direction. But that hedging can, at times, accelerate broader shifts. “As options activity goes up, this can create bigger swings,” said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. Recent studies have led to the theory that option sellers’ so-called gamma exposure could increase volatility, he added.  Nomura analyst Charlie McElligott posited that some financial institutions had been behaving like “full-tilt day traders”, trying to “weaponise” the phenomenon to “amplify and ‘juice’ the intended directional market move”. Nestlé’s M&A regrets It’s not often that the head of a large company publicly admits its dealmaking was a mistake. But Nestlé’s chief executive Mark Schneider is feeling frank. He has acknowledged two dealmaking missteps. Mark Schneider, chief executive officer of Nestlé © Bloomberg First, its $2.6bn purchase of Aimmune Therapeutics in 2020 — the company behind a medication aimed at combating the frequency and severity of allergic reactions to peanuts in children. It has received “slower than expected adoption by patients and healthcare professionals’‘, Nestlé said.  The company has launched a review of the peanut medication and said it will explore options, which could result in a partnership or a sale. Second, Schneider expressed regret over a $950mn acquisition of meal kits start-up Freshly the same year, which will soon merge with Kettle Cuisine, a premium food manufacturer owned by LVMH-backed private equity group L Catterton. Nestlé will be left with a minority stake in the group that delivers ready-to-cook meals, a business model that has slowed since widespread Covid-19 lockdowns ended. The disappointing deals sting that much more given that inflation has taken a toll on the Swiss food company’s profitability, Lex notes. Long referred to as the man who turned round Nestlé, Schneider is no doubt eager to reinforce his reputation. The company has had a net annual return on acquisitions between 11 and 13 per cent since 2018, “with a large majority of transactions at or above their business plans”, the company said.  The owner of two labradoodles, Schneider is now turning to pet food — as well as coffee — for growth. The idea is that, even as consumers re-evaluate everyday purchases, these won’t be hit as hard. Some bankers might be quietly hoping the pet food growth isn’t M&A-driven. They have been known to eat pet food during deal pitches in order to show their enthusiasm for the product.

"Cosmetics group Natura embarks on makeover ","Body Shop and Avon owner is concentrating on revamping its brands during consumer spending squeeze ","Only a few years ago, Natura &Co was a rare case of a Latin American business pursuing truly global ambitions.  The Brazilian cosmetics maker, which prides itself as a standard-bearer for sustainability, embarked on an international drive in the last decade through acquisitions that took it into Australia, Europe and Asia. Its all-stock purchase of door-to-door seller Avon for $2bn in 2019 turned Natura into the world’s fourth largest pure-play beauty group, with a stable of four brands including The Body Shop.    But the heady days of empire building are over. Following a drawn-out share price plunge during the latter half of the pandemic and with its accounts in the red, the São Paulo-headquartered company is in for an overhaul. Hit by squeezed consumer spending and the conflict in Ukraine, the priority now is to improve the bottom line, according to its chief executive. “The focus is more on margins and cash flow generation rather than growth in sales,” said Fábio Barbosa, a former banker who took over last year. Chief executive Fábio Barbosa: ‘The focus is more on margins and cash flow generation rather than growth in sales’ © Patricia Monteiro/Bloomberg Alongside a corporate reorganisation, management is reviewing Natura’s business model and presence in underperforming markets.  “Expansion programmes, geographies that you might have had in the past, we are not bringing to the table anymore,” Barbosa told the Financial Times in an interview. Established in 1969 as a small cosmetics shop on an upmarket street in São Paulo, Natura was a pioneer of direct selling in South America, similar to one-time competitor Avon.   The company is also widely recognised for its social and environmental credentials. For more than 20 years, its eponymous brand has sourced ingredients for soaps, moisturisers and shampoos from the Amazon, where it helps preserve vast tracts of land by working with local communities.  Investors will want to see purpose once again matched with profitability. Natura’s stock has fallen 80 per cent from a peak a year-and-a-half ago, wiping about $12.5bn off its market capitalisation. Today it is valued at just R$16.9bn ($3.2bn).  As retailers shuttered stores during the coronavirus pandemic, the personal care conglomerate initially benefited due to its direct sales and a push into ecommerce, but turnover has since shrunk. Natura’s activities have held up fairly well in Latin America, where rivals include O Boticário. Most of the problems are concentrated elsewhere and often due to external factors, according to Itaú BBA analyst Thiago Macruz. Natura has high hopes for Australian brand Aesop, which is pushing into China  © Tea/Dreamstime “What is the challenge here? The global operations are struggling a lot,” he explained. “There were some significant curveballs thrown their way”.  At Avon, sales have been affected by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine (Natura does not own the brand in North America). Meanwhile, The Body Shop’s large store portfolio across Europe has suffered as inflation on the continent eroded disposable incomes.   This contributed to a third consecutive quarter of losses last year that took Natura’s nine-month deficit to almost R$2bn ($380mn), while revenues fell 9 per cent in constant currency terms to R$26bn ($5bn) during the period.  Financial targets have been scrapped, including cost savings that were to be gained as a result of the merger with Avon.  Management is now betting that the group’s smallest business, which has proven a bright spot amid the difficulties, will provide an important element of the turnround.  A premium cosmetics marque originally from Australia that Natura bought a decade ago, Aesop is an exception to the emphasis away from expansion. Recently it opened its first stores in China, the main growth market for luxury goods globally. “Aesop has always been very consistent,” said Vinícius Strano, an analyst at UBS. “It’s the only brand that held up while Natura, Avon and The Body Shop were deteriorating.” A spin-off or stock market listing is under consideration for the unit, which analysts at Itaú have estimated could be worth R$8bn. Natura is rolling out a new format at The Body Shop, with fewer products and refilling stations that avoid packaging © SOPA Images Limited/Alamy Cash proceeds from any deal would go towards funding Aesop and could also chip away at Natura’s significant borrowings. Group-wide net debt of R$8.8bn has risen to a ratio of 2.85 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  Another pillar of the plan is a restructure of the holding company. Barbosa said this was already bearing fruit, with central function overheads slashed by at least 40 per cent. Decision-making is also being devolved from the centre down to executives running each of the four divisions. “It is much better to delegate, for each unit to have their own reaction to the market realities where they live,” the chief executive added. “It’s the flexibility that we gave to the business units to react. They have more autonomy to make decisions with accountability.” Whether this will be enough to revive a pair of names regarded by some analysts and consumers as old and tired will be the test.  Natura acquired The Body Shop, a British ethical retailer famous for its stance against animal testing, from L’Oréal in 2017 at an enterprise value of €1bn. The aim is a “rejuvenation” of the business, founded in the 1970s by the late campaigner Anita Roddick, while shifting it away from discounts in order to boost margins.  “We want it to go back to the connection that this company always had with society, or even being a bit ahead of society,” said Barbosa. A new store format is being rolled out, initially in the UK where there are 207 stores, with fewer products and refilling stations that avoid packaging.  The revamped premises had already registered an increase in sales, said Barbosa. While many big corporations have abandoned Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Avon has stayed put, maintaining a “self-contained unit” that does not import or export. Barbosa defended the decision on the grounds that it offers a source of income for its famous “Avon ladies” — self-employed sales representatives.   Another source of potential gains is through greater integration of Natura and Avon in Latin America. Barbosa, however, is not looking for an “immediate reaction” from equity investors.  “I think the market would like to see the results rather than the thinking,” he said. “The share price will react once we see the results improving”.

"US S&P 500 ends week nearly 6% higher as inflation data raise investor hopes","Dollar index slips as investors bet the Fed will increase interest rates by 0.5 percentage points in December","US stocks had their biggest weekly rise in months and the dollar declined after cooler than expected inflation data released on Thursday fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest rate tightening later this year. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 added 5.9 per cent over the week, the largest increase since June. It gained 0.9 per cent on Friday, following its best day in two-and-a-half years on Thursday, when it jumped 5.5 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose by the most since March, increasing 8.1 per cent for the week, driven by a 7.4 per cent rise on Thursday and a 1.9 per cent gain on Friday. The dollar index is up 10.8 per cent this year but slipped on Friday as investors dialled back expectations for further aggressive interest rate rises in the US. The dollar fell 1.7 per cent on the day against a basket of six peers, extending a decline since a peak in late September.  “The dollar peak might be past us, but a dollar downtrend may not be there yet,” said Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING. Fears of a global recession next year could yet see investors return to what is widely regarded as a safe haven asset in times of economic uncertainty, Pesole continued. The moves came after data on Thursday that showed the annual rise in the US consumer price index came in at 7.7 per cent in October, the smallest 12-month increase since January and down from an annual rate of 8.2 per cent in September. Markets are now betting there is a roughly 70 per cent chance the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points when it meets in December, breaking a run of four consecutive 0.75 percentage point rises.  But analysts cautioned that some investors may be getting ahead of themselves. “It is still far too early to declare the inflation threat over,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, who thinks the Fed will raise borrowing costs by a further percentage point before it pauses its “rate-hiking cycle”. Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, warned that core CPI numbers remain “way too high” for central banks to consider easing financial conditions. “Lower inflation is a step in the right direction but the pace of disinflation is yet to be seen,” Cau said.  US government bond markets, which are closed on Friday for Veterans Day, had rallied strongly immediately after Thursday’s CPI release. The yield on two-year US Treasuries fell 0.29 percentage points to 4.33 per cent, its largest daily drop in more than a decade. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped 0.33 percentage points to 3.81 per cent, down from a peak of 4.25 per cent in October. Yields fall as prices rise. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 was mostly flat as the European Commission predicted a sharp contraction in German output in the months ahead. London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.8 per cent, erasing earlier gains, after UK gross domestic product fell 0.6 per cent between August and September — a larger drop than the 0.4 per cent forecast by economists.  Meanwhile, Asian equities ticked higher, following indices in the US. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index shot up 7.7 per cent, South Korea’s Kospi increased 3.4 per cent and China’s CSI 300 rose 2.8 per cent. Additional reporting by Harry Dempsey in London","11.11.2022"
"Too late to pull out now","Why Adani’s underwriters can’t heed Ackman’s call to withdraw","Craig Coben is a former senior investment banker at Bank of America and now a managing director at Seda Experts, an expert witness firm specialising in financial services. In a memorable scene from the best Batman movie — the 1966 one, obviously — the eponymous hero discovers a bomb, but is repeatedly stymied as he scrambles to find a place to dispose of it safely. In turn he encounters a marching band, two nuns, a mother with a pram, a butane tank, a couple kissing in a boat and a group of ducks in the water. “Some days,” says Adam West’s exasperated Batman, “you just can’t get rid of a bomb.”   These two minutes of cinematic genius sum up a larger truth. Sometimes there are no good options for offloading a problem, and you have to take responsibility for your actions, whether you are culpable or not.  The scene came to my mind when I read hedge fund manager Bill Ackman’s tweet on Sunday calling on investment banks leading the $2.4bn follow-on offering for Adani Enterprises to withdraw unless they gain clarity on the issues raised by short seller Hindenburg Research.  I don’t see how the bankers for the ⁦@AdaniOnline⁩ equity offering can allow it to close without doing due diligence on the issues identified in the ⁦@HindenburgRes⁩ report. There is just too much liability exposure for the banks.  https://t.co/3I6kruZUaJ— Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) January 29, 2023

 The syndicate has nine Indian banks and one US bank — Jefferies. In fact, Jefferies acted as one of the three lead managers.  The mandate must have been a coup for the Jefferies team. Jefferies isn’t regarded as a “bulge bracket” bank, but it has made a name as a nimble and dynamic insurgent. While European bulge-bracket banks such as Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have lost ground, the US bank has grown market share internationally. Last month it even recruited one of the top European equity capital markets bankers.  Although the fees on an Indian follow-on public offering are wafer-thin — just a few hundred thousand dollars per bank — it is a feather in a bank’s cap to lead a jumbo offering. Jefferies ranked 12 in Indian equity underwriting in 2022 (up from 18 in 2021), and so the lead role must have seemed like a big win. Moreover, investors have to some degree pivoted from China to anoint India as one of the most exciting growth markets in the world.  But last week the mandate took on a different look when Hindenburg published a report alleging share price manipulation and accounting malpractice. The share prices of Adani-related companies have fallen sharply, wiping off billions of dollars in value. Adani came out swinging over the weekend with a robustly-worded 413-page riposte, challenging the logic and motivations of Hindenburg and describing the report as “a calculated attack on India”.   When Ackman laid down his challenge, I knew there was no way that Jefferies or any other bank could contemplate withdrawing from the offering.  Gautam Adani is one of the most important and influential businessmen in India, and Adani conglomerates control critical infrastructure assets, such as airports, ports and energy installations. Walk away from the deal, and you can probably forget about having an investment banking franchise in India. Withdrawal would call into question the due diligence that the lead manager had conducted on the prospectus filed with the Indian regulator SEBI.  Moreover, the banks don’t face any real financial risk from staying in the deal. The offering is not hard-underwritten, and unlike, say, a European-style rights issue, there is no risk that the banks will be left long any shares. Shareholder litigation in India is practically unheard-of, and even though the offering envisages a placement to US investors under Rule 144A (a much-used exemption to SEC registration), the risk of lawsuits is de minimis. Moreover, it would be customary for the placement banks to have an indemnity from Adani in the remote event of an investor lawsuit on the prospectus disclosure.  However, reputationally this is not a comfortable place for any bank, especially a US-based one. An American investment firm — which scored a big success in calling out Nikola Motors — has alleged fraud. One of America’s most famous hedge fund managers has publicly said he found it “highly credible and well-researched”. And shares and bonds in Adani-related companies have continued to sell off aggressively, suggesting that investors are giving the allegations some credence.  Whatever the merits of the accusations, this is all unwelcome noise. Any global bank will have a range of “stakeholders” who will care about the kinds of companies it supports and about the robustness of its due diligence and deal selection processes.  In other words, there were no good options for the syndicate banks, especially Jefferies. You can’t walk away, but staying in the deal leaves you exposed to reputational damage if even a fraction of the Hindenburg allegations are substantiated.   Perhaps one lesson to take is that although insurgent and resurgent banks want to win franchise business in exciting growth markets, the risk/reward must be properly assessed. And hard questions need to be asked, such as:  ● Was it worth taking a lead manager role on a deal paying almost no fees?  ● When the transaction was presented to the internal committees for approval, did anyone ask why no other international bank was involved?  ● Did the bankers believe they had secured the mandate due to brilliant client coverage or because other global banks had shied away? After all, Adani is no pariah in the financial world; it has established relationships with a wide range of international banks. ● While the state-owned insurer LIC and Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Co. have supported the deal, why has the offering commanded little support from Indian mutual funds?  It is possible that Jefferies looked at the situation, conducted detailed due diligence, believed it worthy of support, and was convinced that the doubters and naysayers had the wrong end of the stick. But was it worth the hassle? With such tiny fees, are they being paid for that risk?  At the end of the pier scene the bomb explodes but [SPOILER ALERT] Batman emerges unharmed after sheltering behind some iron construction rods. I believe the syndicate banks will be largely protected because the public focus will be on the back-and-forth between Hindenburg and Adani.  But without opining on the merits of Hindenburg’s claims, I don’t think this mandate was worth taking.","31.01.2023"

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox three times a week Today’s top stories German chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected comparisons between Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse as a slump in the German lender’s shares sparked a further day of turmoil for the banking sector. The Swiss regulator defended the wipeout of $17bn in AT1 bonds in the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. US bondholders are preparing to sue. The UK competition regulator dropped a key concern about the impact of Microsoft’s $75bn acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard on rival Sony, clearing a substantial roadblock to approving the deal. France and the UK have been forced to postpone King Charles’s state visit because of mass protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the pension age from 62 to 64 by 2030 in an effort to cut costs. For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog  Good evening. Whether it’s spy balloons, US export controls or security concerns over a video app, tech tensions between the US and China show no sign of letting up.  We report today that China has released a top chip investor from detention to help it navigate its way through a semiconductor battle with the US. Chen Datong, head of Yuanhe Puhua (Suzhou) Investment Management, also known as Hua Capital, had been detained last August as part of a crackdown against the country’s chip industry, which despite spending billions of dollars, had failed to come up with any big breakthroughs to end its reliance on foreign semiconductors.  US restrictions on chip-related exports, first announced last October, are part of wider efforts to build up its domestic capacity and prevent China from developing technologies with military uses. The latest stipulation says US chipmakers operating in China will have to halt their operations for at least a decade if they want access to federal funds earmarked in the $280bn Chips and Science Act. The moves have prompted a rethink of semiconductor strategy in China, with chipmakers given easier access to subsidies and more control over state-backed research.  In the meantime, some Chinese AI groups are getting round the restrictions by accessing high-end US chips through intermediaries, while companies such as the Netherlands’ ASML, the chip toolmaker that is Europe’s biggest tech company, have expressed concerns about potential intellectual property theft.  Tensions are also ratcheting up over TikTok, the viral video app that has become a flashpoint in relations between the US and China as politicians express fears that it could be used to steal sensitive data. A US congressional committee yesterday battered chief executive Shou Zi Chew, threatening to ban the app, calling it a “cancer” and a tool of surveillance, while the UK parliament became the latest public organisation to ban it from its devices and networks. It has already been banned from UK government devices, following similar moves in the EU, the US and Canada.  Chew vowed to keep the app “free from government manipulation” but was rather undermined by China denouncing Washington’s demand that it should be sold by its owner ByteDance to cut ties with its home country. All of which might go some way to explain why US businesses are rather shy about their attendance at the China Development Forum — “China’s Davos” — which opens tomorrow.  This year’s event, billed as an opening-up party after three years of pandemic restrictions, could offer some clues as to whether political concerns are still being trumped by the lure of what Deloitte calls “the most attractive growth market in the world”.  Need to know: UK and Europe economy The UK enjoyed some positive economic news to end the week with S&P Global’s PMI survey showing business activity expanding again in March to hit a score of 52.2, where 50 marks the difference between expansion and shrinking. Separate official data showed UK retail sales jumped by a more-than-expected 1.2 per cent in February, while a survey showed consumer confidence improving in March (although still in negative territory). Today’s data follows yesterday’s decision by the Bank of England to raise its key interest rate for the 11th consecutive month, this time by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 per cent. It left future options open but raised its GDP prediction for the second quarter to slight growth, rather than its previous estimate of a 0.4 per cent decline. The eurozone also had a good PMI result, hitting a better than expected 10-month high of 54.1, driven by growth in the services sector. The individual result for Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, although overall positive, showed a decline in manufacturing activity.   Germany’s energy regulator said the country risked running out of gas next winter. A new Big Read delves into Europe’s attempts to ramp up solar power, a sector reliant on China for raw materials and technology. Need to know: Global economy The US PMI result also showed a decent expansion in business activity, hitting a score of 53.3, up from 50.1 in February. US investors are betting that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate rise this week will be the last for a while as bank failures help the fight against inflation by turning the screws on borrowers. Fed officials today defended their decision.  Russia and Iran, both targets of western sanctions, have stepped up economic relations. Moscow has become the Islamic republic’s biggest source of overseas direct investment.  Copper prices will hit a record high this year as demand from China risks depleting low stockpiles, according to Trafigura, the world’s largest private metals trader.   China’s Covid-19 crackdown and property collapse was bad news for the country’s super-rich, with the country’s total wealth falling 15 per cent, according to the M3M Hurun Global Rich List. It still remains the world’s “absolute No. 1” for billionaires.

Here’s our round-up of recent books on climate and the environment.   A report from the UK’s “hydrogen champion” said ministers should go ahead with the blending of hydrogen into the UK gas network as long as it was proved safe. The debate about the origins of Covid-19 rumbles on. The World Health Organization said data from China pointing to animals in Wuhan’s wet market as the virus source should have been shared with the world three years ago and that the findings “do not provide a definitive answer”. The WHO urged African health authorities to step up monitoring after Tanzania reported its first outbreak of Marburg virus. Marburg spreads to humans from fruit bats and is passed on through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients.

"How a Saudi Prince lost a £250mn London mansion","Plus, Silicon Valley investors hype up artificial intelligence and a short seller makes allegations against firms that worked with Wirecard","One thing to start: Private equity firm General Atlantic is teaming up with Abu Dhabi state fund ADQ and IHC, the emirate’s largest listed company, to launch a new investment firm.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Prince Khaled and The HolmeSilicon Valley hypes up artificial intelligenceThe cons of working with Wirecard For sale: a £250mn mansion with a convoluted past No property has embodied London’s lucrative, decades-long love affair with Saudi money quite like The Holme.   But the sprawling 40-room Regent’s Park mansion could also come to symbolise financial pressure on Saudi Arabia’s royal elite and their overseas investments. The Holme © Charlie Bibby/FT The sale stems from a 2016 lease by Prince Khaled bin Sultan al-Saud for a private jet. At the time, his Swiss wealth advisers pulled together a list of assets to secure financing that included the crown jewel of his family fortune: The Holme.  But to collect unpaid lease payments on the jet, a company managed by London hedge fund Attestor has appointed receivers for the property, pushing the 205-year-old house back on to the market, the FT reports.  The sale offers a rare glimpse into Britain’s normally discreet high-end property market, as DD delved into last week. A lawsuit from a second lender, Yuntian 10 Leasing Company — an Irish subsidiary of China Minsheng Bank that leased Prince Khaled his private jet via a Bermuda company — has only increased the public scrutiny.  Yuntian claims that Prince Khaled, who transferred $43mn in cash to Guernsey-registered Quendon Limited to buy The Holme back in 1991, has retained a beneficial ownership interest in the property. Therefore, it argues, the house can be used to collect unpaid lease payments on the jet.  The £250mn that The Holme may fetch would be London’s most expensive residential deal on record. His father’s estate was the previous record holder when it sold a £210mn home in London to Evergrande billionaire Hui Ka Yan in 2020. Even so, Prince Khaled has mostly remained under the radar until recently. Saudi Prince Khaled bin Sultan al-Saud  After being dubbed the “Father of Saudi Arabia’s missile” for his work procuring weapons for the kingdom, the former Saudi deputy defence minister and eldest son of Saudi Arabia’s former Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud left his military career behind to pursue marine conservation.  Described by his foundation as an “avid scuba diver”, the ocean enthusiast has hosted research expeditions on his Golden Odyssey yacht. That same vessel made an appearance in the “Paradise Papers” — which listed Prince Khaled as having registered at least eight companies in Bermuda, “some of which were used to own yachts and aircraft”. The real estate saga has also shed light on the number of investors that have backed the Guernsey vehicle Quendon over the years. Quendon has borrowed more heavily against the house in recent years, using funds from Standard Chartered to repay a loan from Citibank, and a new loan from Attestor-managed Trinity Investments to repay that one.  An adviser to Saudi royalty said Prince Khaled “was in a very good position” financially after the 2011 death of his father, receiving the “lion’s share” of the inheritance.  But they pointed to one major catalyst as to where things went south: “his financial circumstances changed massively” around 2017, the adviser said.  That year marked a big change in the finances of Saudi royals, as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman became the kingdom’s de facto ruler and began to rein in lavish state spending on princes and marginalise those not closest to him. Is AI hype the new crypto? Sarah Guo moved on quickly from the crypto winter.  Six months ago, she was leading investment into the sector for venture capital firm Greylock, alongside her role as an angel investor in cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  FTX has since collapsed, along with cryptocurrency values. Guo hasn’t. Instead, she has raised more than $100mn for a new fund with a new focus: artificial intelligence.  Guo isn’t alone in pivoting fast towards a technology that has lit up Silicon Valley and given investors something to talk about other than the downturn. But a sizeable group remains unpersuaded, the FT’s George Hammond reports.  A string of “generative AI” platforms, aka tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, which is capable of answering complex questions with text in natural-sounding language, have raised fresh cash in the past few months, at far higher valuations than in previous rounds. Sceptics don’t doubt the technology’s potential. But they can’t see how to make money from it.  The money is going into “foundation models”, machine-learning systems that have the potential to disrupt everything from copywriting to medical diagnostics, but require huge amounts of data and computing power to operate.  They also require huge amounts of cash, and the layer of applications built on top of them — which many venture capitalists regard as the easiest way to make money on the technology — has yet to be developed.  With the chastening experience of the crypto crash in the recent past, some investors aren’t ready to place bets. “Sometimes the bubble moves from one place to the other, the money has to go somewhere,” said one venture capital investor who saw a crypto bet sour last year. “During these hype cycles there will be many things which are overvalued — there are many toys.” The short seller still taking on Wirecard Before Wirecard became synonymous with a spectacular accounting fraud, a former chief executive on trial and another top executive on the run, the German payments group called in back-up as its reputation came under fire. Enter law firm Jones Day and corporate intelligence group Kroll, which were brought in to do damage control and investigate perceived opponents ahead of Wirecard’s collapse in June 2020. Among their targets, a lawsuit filed in the UK High Court alleges, was short seller Matt Earl. Earl alleges that the firms used hacked and stolen communications as a pretext for “overt surveillance” and “specious legal threats” designed to harass, distress “and ultimately to deter him from reporting on Wirecard’s criminal activities”. Kroll said it “denies Mr Earl’s claims in full”, and that it “acted entirely in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations”. Jones Day did not respond to requests for comment. However Earl’s suit pans out, it’s a strong signal that the Wirecard aftershocks are far from over. Jones Day and Kroll weren’t the only London professional service firms that took on the company as a client in its time of need.

"MSCI investors at risk of exposure to Xinjiang allegations, report says","China has come under renewed international pressure over its treatment of Uyghur Muslims","The world’s biggest asset management, state pension and sovereign wealth funds are passively invested in companies which have allegedly been involved in the repression of Uyghur Muslims in north-west China’s Xinjiang region, a new report says. According to Hong Kong Watch, a UK-based research group, and the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice at Sheffield Hallam University, three major stock indices provided by index publisher MSCI include at least 13 companies which have allegedly used forced labour or have profited from China’s construction of internment camps in Xinjiang and its surveillance apparatus in recent years. The report, which will be published on Monday, shows how leading asset managers, including BlackRock, HSBC, UBS and Deutsche Bank, are exposed to index funds that include companies accused of being complicit in rights violations.  Hong Kong Watch said pension funds from Canada, the US and UK — including the Church of England’s fund — as well as Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund are also exposed. However, the Church of England insisted its pension fund does not use the MSCI emerging markets tracker for its passive index.* “Major institutional investors are funding companies known to be involved and benefiting from the crisis in the Uyghur region,” the report said. “It is vital that firms take action and actually live up to the ethical commitments that they have made under ESG frameworks and through signing international human rights compacts.” China has come under renewed international pressure over its treatment of Xinjiang’s Uyghur population, which numbers about 12mn in a region of 25mn. In a landmark report in September, the UN’s top human rights body said China’s actions could constitute “crimes against humanity”. Beijing has denied the allegations as a “fabricated lie”. The Hong Kong Watch report focuses on companies included in the MSCI indices which have been identified in academic research and news reports as allegedly complicit in the human rights violations. The report lists seven companies that allegedly used Uyghur workers obtained through state-sponsored transfers, a form of forced labour. They include electronics group Avary Holding, Foxconn, the main manufacturer of Apple iPhones in China, and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology, China’s biggest wind turbine maker. It also lists six groups allegedly involved in the construction of prisons, internment camps and surveillance infrastructure in Xinjiang, including video surveillance maker Dahua Technology, speech recognition developer iFlytek, biotech group BGI Genomics and telecoms company ZTE.  Twelve of the companies are in the MSCI China index, 13 are in the MSCI Emerging Markets index and four are in the MSCI All Country World index. MSCI told the Financial Times that the only “filters for inclusion” in its global indices are “accessibility and investability”.   “If an international investor is able to access the stock market and invest in companies in the market, then the market and those companies are eligible for inclusion in our market indices,” the company said. MSCI added that it has various ESG-focused indices for which its researchers conduct “daily monitoring of controversies and other governance issues”. Foxconn and Avary denied all allegations of forced labour. Each company pointed to independent audits and investigations in the past two years that found no evidence of labour abuse. Dahua and BGI, two of the groups which allegedly supported the surveillance apparatus, have also rejected allegations of human rights abuses. The remaining nine companies identified by Hong Kong Watch did not respond to a request for comment.  Morningstar data show that the stocks flagged in the new report are included in 16 dollar- and sterling-denominated funds benchmarked against the three MSCI stock indices in question, representing a combined market value of more than $106bn. Among the biggest benefits of inclusion in such benchmarks are the passive inflows prompted by these and other stock indices, which can provide a substantial boost to valuation by driving demand for the underlying equities. Taken together, the market capitalisation of the 13 listings named in Hong Kong Watch’s report comes to roughly $158bn, according to FT calculations based on Bloomberg data. *This article has been amended to make clear that the Church of England denies its pension fund uses the MSCI emerging markets tracker for its passive index.","21.11.2022"
"America’s chip controls on China will carry a heavy cost","Washington should provide clarity over scope of semiconductor export measures","It was less a decoupling and more a rupture. At a stroke last month, Joe Biden did potentially more to sever trade ties between the US and China than Donald Trump ever managed, despite the ex-president’s bombast. Controls barring US companies from exporting critical semiconductor manufacturing tools to China mark a further junking of the theory that the US could tame Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions through closer trade ties. They are a significant gamble.  The measures were unveiled days before China’s party congress, when attention was focused on the coronation of Xi Jinping as essentially ruler-for-life of an increasingly authoritarian Fortress China. No matter the intention, it is hard to see how Beijing would view the controls as anything but a provocation, even if Washington is trying to play down fears of a tech cold war. The White House has framed the measures as an attempt to curb Chinese military use of high-end chips. It is understandable that the US wants to blunt the military ambitions of an increasingly assertive and nationalistic rival. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the economic woes that rippled across the world as a result of soaring energy prices, have prompted a rethink over the wisdom of dependence on regimes that are potential adversaries. But the dual-use nature and ubiquity of chips in daily life — not for nothing are semiconductors dubbed the new oil — means the implications of this action run wider.  The sweeping controls extend not only to the export of US semiconductor chips but also to any advanced chips made with US equipment. They target “US persons”, meaning not just citizens but green-card holders too. As a result, companies from Taiwan to South Korea to the Netherlands are now trying to quantify their exposure, let alone those in the US and China. More precision over the scope of the measures — particularly around US persons — is needed.  As they currently stand, such measures carry real risks. One is retaliation in kind by China, perhaps over rare metals vital to the modern technology-dependent economy. China processes 65 per cent of the world’s lithium, for instance.  The US sanctions would be the least of the world’s concerns if China ever decides to use force to reunify with Taiwan, which dominates global advanced semiconductor manufacturing. The US Navy chief has warned that China could invade the island state before 2024. Quite apart from the misery of war imposed on Taiwan, losing access to Taiwanese chips would affect the supply and price of everything from computers to cars. A Chinese invasion would also trigger a wave of sanctions that would, in turn, hit interconnected economies. This would be an order of magnitude bigger than disruption unleashed by the war in Ukraine. The hope must be that Russia’s botched invasion, and the west’s response, has given China pause for thought. The US semiconductor measures come as other economies, and the business world, are trying to calibrate relations with China. Bankers, says the chair of UBS, are “all very pro-China”. Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, met Xi in Beijing on Friday in a sign of Germany’s persistent dependence on China and its failure to learn from the mercantilism that has made it hard to shrug off Russia’s bearhug.  The US, too, will need to be able to back up its “Made in America” bravado. It may have already spent billions of dollars in setting up domestic chip fabrication plants but analysts estimate it will require as much as $1.2tn in upfront costs, then another $125bn a year, to create fully localised supply chains at 2019 levels of production, all during a cost of living crisis. The bill for decoupling China and America’s economies will carry a heavy cost. ","07.11.2022"
"Asset Management: BlackRock’s risk control warnings to SVB","Plus, Ken Griffin vs Bill Ackman, a sell-off in European banks, and Alice Neel at the Barbican","One scoop to start: Billionaire trader Chris Rokos and Goldman Sachs are among big-name investors that have been hit hard in the market upheaval following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. And another thing: Yesterday UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for $3.25bn after a frantic weekend of negotiations brokered by Swiss regulators to safeguard its banking system and attempt to prevent a crisis spreading across global financial markets.

Let me know: harriet.agnew@ft.com  SVB collapse heralds ‘slow rolling crisis,’ says Fink BlackRock has emerged as a behind-the-scenes protagonist in the saga of Silicon Valley Bank, the California-based lender whose failure helped spark a banking crisis.   The world’s largest asset manager warned SVB that its risk controls were “substantially below” its peers in early 2022, revealed by my colleagues Antoine Gara and Brooke Masters in New York. SVB hired BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory Group in October 2020 to analyse the potential impact of various risks on its securities portfolio. It later expanded the mandate to examine the risk systems, processes and people in its treasury department, which managed the investments.  The January 2022 risk control report gave the bank a “gentleman’s C”, finding that SVB lagged behind similar banks on 11 of 11 factors considered and was “substantially below” them on 10 out of 11. The consultants found that SVB was unable to generate real time or even weekly updates about what was happening to its securities portfolio.  SVB listened to the criticism but rebuffed offers from BlackRock to do follow up work. SVB was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on March 10 after it announced a $1.8bn loss on sales of securities, sparking a share price collapse and a deposit run. It accentuated fears over larger paper losses the bank was nursing in long-dated securities that lost value as the Fed raised interest rates.  Last week BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink used his closely watched annual letter to weigh into the collapse of SVB. He raised the spectre of a “slow rolling crisis” in the US financial system following the failure of the California-based lender, “with more seizures and shutdowns coming”.  The founder of the $8.6tn money manager said SVB’s collapse was an example of the “price we’re paying for decades of easy money”. (Another was the liability-driven investing strategies that blew up in UK pension funds last autumn.)  Rapidly rising interest rates were “the first domino to drop” while SVB was an instance of the second, Fink wrote as he warned that other regional banks and investors who rely on leverage could also follow suit.  Fink said that swift regulatory action had helped stabilise markets after the biggest bank failure since 2008. But he nonetheless compared recent events to the 1980s savings and loan crisis, when more than 1,000 lenders collapsed. He wrote:  “We don’t know yet whether the consequences of easy money and regulatory changes will cascade throughout the US regional banking sector (akin to the S&L Crisis) with more seizures and shutdowns coming.”  Where else in the financial system do you see cracks appearing? Email me: harriet.agnew@ft.com  Griffin vs Ackman Last week two prominent hedge fund billionaires offered opposing views of how regulators should have handled the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, said the rescue package for SVB unveiled by US regulators shows American capitalism is “breaking down before our eyes”.  Griffin told the Financial Times that the US government should not have intervened to protect all SVB depositors. “The US is supposed to be a capitalist economy, and that’s breaking down before our eyes,” he said in an interview on Monday, a day after US regulators pledged to protect all depositors in SVB — even those with balances above the $250,000 federal insurance limit.  “There’s been a loss of financial discipline with the government bailing out depositors in full,” Griffin added.   SVB was shut down by US regulators on Friday after customers raced to withdraw $42bn — a quarter of its total deposits — in one day and a failed effort to raise new capital called into question the future of the tech-focused lender.  Critics of the rescue package have pointed to the risk of moral hazard that comes from making all depositors whole on the money they have with SVB, while regulators have faced questions over missed warning signs. “The regulator was the definition of being asleep at the wheel,” Griffin said.  The billionaire Citadel founder, whose fund this year became the most successful hedge fund firm ever, said the strength of the US economy meant the US government did not have to take such forceful action. “It would have been a great lesson in moral hazard,” he said.  “Losses to depositors would have been immaterial, and it would have driven home the point that risk management is essential. We’re at full employment, credit losses have been minimal, and bank balance sheets are at their strongest ever. We can address the issue of moral hazard from a position of strength.”  Griffin’s stance contrasts starkly with that of Bill Ackman, another high-profile hedge fund manager, who on Monday called for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to “explicitly guarantee all deposits now”, warning that “hours matter”. Ackman said on Twitter that “our economy will not function effectively without our community and regional banking system”.  He said that neither he nor his hedge fund Pershing Square had any exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, adding that his personal exposure to the venture capital industry was “less than 10 per cent of my assets”. Chart of the week  As shares in their companies were tanking last week, a small group of European bank bosses sat down in London for a dinner of saffron risotto, salmon and asparagus and agreed that the market reaction to the collapse of a Californian lender was overblown. The chief executives were adamant that investors were “underestimating” the strength of European banks’ balance sheets “in terms of liquidity, capital, earnings and asset quality”, said Davide Serra, the founder of investment boutique Algebris Investments and host of the dinner.  Europe’s banks “are the strongest they’ve been for 30 years — if ever there was a moment to panic, it’s not now”, Serra added.  Until US federal regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank last week, after rising interest rates blew a hole in its balance sheet, some bankers in Europe were only dimly aware of the tech-focused bank’s 40-year existence. Since then the fallout has been swift and brutal as investors dumped European banking shares.  “The rise in rates has been so rapid that you see cracks starting to appear,” said Kevin Thozet, a member of the investment committee of French asset manager Carmignac. “Risk management at large European banks is very different from that of regional US banks. The risks are lesser, because they are largely covered and hedged. But all the same, where has that risk been passed on to? We don’t know that yet.”  Credit Suisse was the catalyst for much of the pain that rippled through Europe, from France’s BNP Paribas and Société Générale to Spain’s BBVA and Britain’s Barclays.  Five unmissable stories this week Baillie Gifford’s flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust asked one of its non-executive directors to resign at a board meeting on Thursday, following what he said was a disagreement over the appointment of new board members at the £13.4bn FTSE-listed company. Are hedge funds partly to blame for the tumult in the Treasuries market? A historic rally in world’s most liquid market may have reflected a “short squeeze,” writes markets editor Katie Martin. David Tepper has snapped up bonds of SVB Financial Group, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, in a bet that the value of the debt will rise as parts of the group are auctioned off. Tepper acquired the bonds along with preferred stock via Appaloosa, which for the most part manages his family’s multibillion-dollar fortune.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s sweeping boost to UK pension tax breaks looks set to benefit many higher earners, including doctors, lawyers and bankers. But last week’s announcements raise as many questions as they give answers. Here’s what the tax-free pension changes mean for you  The world’s largest private investment firms, including Blackstone Group, Apollo Global Management, KKR, Ares Management and Carlyle Group, are exploring the purchase of loans from the remains of Silicon Valley Bank following its collapse. They are examining SVB’s $74bn loan book for pieces that might fit into their credit portfolios.

"Managed by Macquarie: the Australian group with a grip on global infrastructure  ","The investment management company was a pioneer in turning public utilities into lucrative assets, but does that model make for good policy?","Buried in the ground, far out of sight, exists a sprawling web of copper and steel pipes that are integral to keeping homes across the world running smoothly. Whether they are filling British taps with water, transporting gas across the southern US or acting as underground broadband ducts beneath remote parts of Spain, the common denominator is likely to be Macquarie, the Australian financial services company that has become quietly ubiquitous in global infrastructure. Macquarie’s rise from a far-flung, three-person operation in the 1960s to the largest infrastructure asset manager in the world is a remarkable one. Overall, it has $590bn assets under management and is also a global commodities trading giant, a leading corporate adviser on mergers and acquisitions — and a rapidly growing player in Australia’s powerful retail banking industry.   With such outsized success has come increased scrutiny of an enigmatic company that would prefer to downplay its influence.  As Macquarie has grown in stature, the company has been derisively nicknamed the “Vampire Kangaroo” — an Antipodean twist on the infamous name given to imperious investment bank Goldman Sachs — because of its reputation for buying essential public infrastructure, increasing its debt and paying out handsome sums to shareholders. This lucrative strategy, first pioneered in the 1990s, became so popular it got its own name: the Macquarie model.  Now, decades after governments first started to sell off crucial public assets, the robust financial health of Macquarie and its peers contrasts starkly with the standing of indebted utilities that many believe are failing to meet the needs of growing populations. This has led critics — even some inside the industry — to question whether using private finance in essential state monopolies is in the public interest. It has become especially controversial in the UK, where Macquarie’s decades-long history of investments in the country’s large private water monopolies has dragged its name into growing public outrage over pollution and sewage in rivers and coastal waters. “We have in the past 30 years been handing many of our crucial infrastructure assets to private investors, while the risks remain with the public,” says Peter Folkman, a former council member of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association who teaches at Alliance Manchester Business School.  “Macquarie was one of the first to realise how the steady and predictable cash flows from infrastructure investments could be levered to produce very attractive returns to equity investors,” he says. “But as a public policy, it’s questionable.” A well-honed playbook Named after the British army officer credited with transforming what was then the penal colony of New South Wales into a free settlement, Macquarie evolved into a global behemoth valued at A$71bn ($48bn) thanks in part to its flagship infrastructure financing model.   Macquarie stepped in as governments privatised assets to shift debts off their balance sheets and turned to private capital to raise finance for new projects. In the process, it helped transform infrastructure into an asset class, a tradable financial product, highly attractive to investors. “If you don’t attract private sector investors, the state has to do it all,” says Simon Montague of the Global Infrastructure Investor Association. “Bill-payers or taxpayers will ultimately be funding investment, whoever raises the finance.” Today, Macquarie’s investment portfolio includes everything from toll roads and car parks, to airports, ports and aircraft, bridges and battery storage, solar and wind farms, fibre networks and data centres, hospitals and specialist disability homes. Its supporters credit the company with creating a framework that has drawn much-needed finance to the structures and facilities that keep society ticking — and, most recently, government-backed renewables, including the nascent hydrogen, bioenergy and carbon capture markets. Macquarie led the acquisition of the Chicago Skyway toll bridge in 2004. The deal marked the first time an American toll road passed from public hands into private operation © Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images The UK was among the countries that embraced the privatisation of critical infrastructure most enthusiastically, particularly with regard to essential monopolies such as water. “People like owning essential monopolies because, in the absence of close regulation, they can extract high profits,” says Jon Moulton, a private equity veteran and founder of Better Capital. “Given that no one wants to suffer the potentially ugly consequences of a bankruptcy . . . regulators [which set the amount the monopolies can charge customers] normally allow prices to rise so that the risk of having high debt levels is very low for investors.”  As governments opened up to the idea of transferring public assets into private hands, Macquarie’s investments fanned out across the world, such as the Chicago Skyway toll bridge in 2004. At the time, it was the largest infrastructure privatisation deal in US history and the first time one of the country’s toll roads passed into private operation. By that point, Macquarie had developed a well-honed playbook: it uses a standard private equity model, which creates infrastructure funds by raising cash from large-scale investors, such as pension and investment groups.  These provide the equity portion of the funding used to buy a particular asset, such as a water or power company, a road, or gas or telecoms network, for example. The balance is then borrowed from the large global banks or private debt funds.  Macquarie’s income, as the manager of the funds invested in various assets, comes from management and performance fees tied to the fund’s returns. After acquisition, the stable cash flows generated by the asset provide the security for further borrowing, allowing Macquarie to significantly increase the indebtedness of the acquired company.  This provides funding which can either be used to invest in the business or to enhance investor returns through dividend payments and early repayment of the loans made by investors as part of the initial deal. Folkman, who is himself a private equity investor, points out the risk: “Given the incentives and investor objectives they choose to take the money out rather than reinvesting in the business.” The result, Folkman says, can be ageing assets loaded with debt. But Paul Jarvis, managing editor at Partnerships Bulletin, which reports on public-private partnerships, defends the industry: “Obviously it is more expensive to raise private finance than for the government to pay for infrastructure directly, but the fact is that states aren’t going to put all these projects on their balance sheets. “And although a lot of fuss is made about the negative cases, the majority of projects are running as originally planned and are delivering the services as needed.” Troubled waters Macquarie first dipped its toe into the UK’s waters in 2003, with its shortlived acquisition of South East Water. After buying the company for £386mn from the French conglomerate Bouygues, Macquarie sold its final stake three years later for £665mn. During that period, debt — some of which was raised via a Cayman Islands subsidiary — increased more than fourfold from £87mn to £458mn.  The increase in borrowing was used to pay investors more than £60mn in dividends as well as to pay off most of the costs of acquiring the company so that the final sales price was mostly profit. Although this was a win for investors in Macquarie’s funds, which benefited from the returns guaranteed from providing an essential daily service, it was a loss for customers because a greater proportion of their bills — up from 8.7 per cent of turnover in 2002 to 14 per cent in 2006 — began to go towards paying the interest on debt. “This is part of a pattern for investors,” says Kate Bayliss, an infrastructure finance expert from Soas, University of London. “Macquarie [and other private equity investors] move in and change the corporate structure. They refinance the assets, hiking up the debt and reducing the equity investment. Sometimes part of the acquisition cost is allocated to the company purchased.” Protesters on Tankerton beach in Kent demonstrate against Southern Water’s sewage discharges. The pollution of rivers and seas has led to a backlash against the privatisation of utilities © Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images Macquarie repeated exactly the same strategy, but for bigger stakes, when it and its co-investors acquired Thames Water, which now has 15mn customers in London and the Thames Valley, from German utility RWE for £4.8bn in 2006.  One of the Macquarie consortium’s first acts was to arrange for Thames Water to pay a £656mn dividend in a year in which profits were just £241mn. Within six years, the group of companies managed by Macquarie had recovered all the money it and co-investors had spent on the acquisition, by borrowing against its assets and paying out dividends. By the time Macquarie sold its final stake in Thames Water in 2017, the company had spent £11bn from customer bills on infrastructure. But far from injecting any new capital in the business — one of the original justifications for privatisation — £2.7bn had been taken out in dividends and £2.2bn in loans.   Meanwhile, the pension deficit grew from £18mn in 2006 to £380mn in 2017. Thames Water’s debt also increased steeply from £3.4bn in 2007 to £10.8bn at the point of sale, a sum still being paid off with interest by customers long after Macquarie has moved on. Just weeks after Macquarie sold its final stake in the business in 2017, Thames Water received a £20mn fine for river pollution. Bayliss compares this to buying a house, where the stability of the revenue flow from customer bills enables the financiers to purchase the company and take a mortgage against it. “The difference is that unlike homebuyers who pay the mortgage, they transfer the mortgage back to the company so it’s the customers who pay the interest.” Such practices are common to private equity structures, but when the underlying companies are utilities there is an added tension: the decision over how much they can charge customers to pay for investment — both for day-to-day running and improvements — is made by the regulators who oversee monopolies. With demanding shareholders on one side and price restrictions on the other, it is the investment in the underlying infrastructure that is often sacrificed. “Let’s be clear,” says Folkman, of Alliance Manchester Business School. “If my financial incentive is that I will be paid if I satisfy my investors, then I will do things that will satisfy my investors . . . and that’s the problem. It’s not that you’re wicked, it’s what you’re paid to do.”  Macquarie’s decision to take over Southern Water — another UK water utility facing huge investment challenges — as it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in 2021 was welcomed by the water regulator Ofwat.  Earlier that year, Southern Water had been fined £90mn for deliberately dumping billions of litres of untreated sewage into the sea between 2010 and 2015. Since taking over as the majority investor from a consortium including JPMorgan Asset Management and UBS Asset Management, Macquarie has pledged to raise transparency, close Cayman Islands subsidiaries at the company and to significantly increase investment in sewage treatment works. Macquarie says it is a responsible investor. “As custodians of vital businesses which touch every aspect of people’s daily lives, we have both a responsibility and an opportunity to ensure that we are actively driving positive change,” reads a statement on its website. But the pollution and water leaks across the sector have given ammunition to critics from all sides of the political and economic spectrum who are concerned over private ownership of crucial public infrastructure, where the government — and taxpayers — would be forced to take over in the event of any financial or environmental catastrophe. Now, more than three decades after the regional water authorities were sold off with no debt, the privately owned monopolies are saddled with £62bn in borrowings and regulator Ofwat has raised concerns over their financial stability. Sir Dieter Helm, a former UK government adviser and professor of economics at Oxford university, warns that instead of privatisation being used as intended, to finance investment and spread the cost long-term, “regulators have allowed [it] to be subverted by widespread financial engineering”.  “Now the balance sheets of these big utilities are largely exhausted, and without gaining the benefit of the really good infrastructure that privatisation promised,” he adds. “On the contrary, recent evidence from both water and electricity distribution suggests that in some cases not even the necessary capital maintenance has been done.” Expanding empire With US$200bn of global infrastructure assets now under management, Macquarie remains the biggest player in an area still rife with opportunities. Since becoming chief executive in 2018, Shemara Wikramanayake, a Macquarie insider who joined just after the 1987 financial crisis, has prioritised climate change and renewable energy for investment as well as digital infrastructure in the form of subsea cables and data centres.  The company’s £2.3bn purchase of the UK government’s Green Investment Bank in 2017 helped catalyse that vision, and it is now one of the world’s largest renewable investors in wind farms and solar power. A Thames Water tanker in Northend, southern England. When Macquarie sold its final shares in the UK’s largest water company, the supplier’s debt had ballooned to more than £10bn © Andrew Matthews/PA With supportive governments worldwide and A$35bn ($23.7bn) of available so-called dry powder — money kept in reserve to spend when opportunities arise — few observers expect Macquarie’s influence to diminish, particularly if it is eyeing up the vast amount of investment needed to help the world move on from fossil fuels. The company says it is mindful of the responsibilities that come with owning assets that people around the world rely upon. “Ageing infrastructure, population growth and the impacts of climate change all necessitate significant, multi-decade investment programmes to upgrade critical infrastructure and redress what can often be many generations of under-investment,” Macquarie says.  In committing to these kinds of programmes, active investment managers expect “a reasonable return to match the construction, operational and wider risks they are taking”. But when the public perceives owners to be failing to keep up their end of that deal, it can quickly stir anger. Campaigners recently challenged Southern Water chief executive Lawrence Gosden, the former Thames Water executive appointed by Macquarie, to swim at one of England’s effluent-soaked beaches.  Although the pollution long predates Macquarie’s involvement in Southern Water, Gosden will join many water company bosses in declining to take a bonus this year, stating the utility has “clearly not met the wider expectations of our customers”.  Yet Macquarie’s grip on the UK’s infrastructure more widely is set to tighten. In January, Macquarie, alongside the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, bought a 60 per cent stake in the 7,660km gas distribution network in the UK, with ambitious plans to convert them for hydrogen use. Now, more than three decades after privatisation first became popular, governments are faced with a conundrum: how they can use private finance in infrastructure in a way that delivers adequate returns for shareholders and deliver high quality services for the people — their voters — who are paying for them. “This is the issue of the decade,” says Folkman. “We know we want lots of investment to transition to net zero and even just to repair what’s failing. But if we want to make it work for investors as well as the public we need to figure out how to do it better and soon.” Data visualisation by Chris Campbell","27.06.2023"
"What will the Fed’s ‘dot plot’ reveal about longer-term rates?","Market Questions is the FT’s guide to the week ahead","What will the Fed’s ‘dot plot’ reveal about longer-term rate expectations? The Federal Reserve is widely expected to conclude its last policy meeting for the year on Wednesday with an announcement that it will raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, slowing its pace after four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases.  Fed chair Jay Powell said in a speech last week that the time to slow its pace of increases may come as soon as December and acknowledged that the US central bank was concerned about the prospects of overtightening policy. The slowdown has come as US data have begun to show evidence of cooling inflation. In October consumer prices rose but at their slowest rate since January.  The real story, however, will be in the Fed’s “dot plot”, a survey of officials on where they believe interest rates, inflation, unemployment and gross domestic product will be in the years to come. Rate estimates in the survey are expected to have increased meaningfully from September and show a Fed that is prepared to keep policy tighter for longer.   At present, the futures market shows investors expect interest rates to peak in May at about 5 per cent before the Fed is forced to cut rates by the end of the year by at least 0.5 percentage points. But New York Fed president John Williams, a close colleague of Powell’s, has indicated that he does not expect the bank to cut interest rates until at least 2024. A dot plot showing tighter policy through the end of 2023 could force investors at present betting on looser monetary policy to adjust their positions. Kate Duguid How will fresh data affect the BoE’s interest rate decision? Investors expect the Bank of England to slow the pace of rate increases on Thursday but economists noted that data released at the start of the week could still change the outcome. Markets are pricing in an 80 per cent probability that the central bank will increase its policy rate by half a percentage point to 3.5 per cent. The BoE has been battling the fastest pace of inflation in 41 years and raised the benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in November. Anna Titareva, European economist at UBS, expects “the majority of the [Monetary Policy] Committee to vote in favour of a smaller rate increase”. This is because medium-term inflation expectations “have eased in recent months”, while several members of the BoE “have noted indications of an easing in labour demand”, she said. “Last but not least, given the lags in monetary policy transmission, most of the impact of the hikes already delivered is still yet to come, with the magnitude subject to significant uncertainty.” Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC, also thinks the BoE will increase rates by 50 basis points but noted that influential economic releases may sway members of the committee.  These include November’s CPI inflation data, which economists polled by Reuters expect to have slowed to 10.9 per cent from 11.1 per cent in October; October’s GDP, set to show a small gain of 0.4 per cent; and the labour market report, which is forecast to show more signs of falling job vacancies and declining employment numbers.   “If all three come out strong, it might tip the balance [of the MPC] towards a larger hike,” said Martins. Valentina Romei Will the ECB slow the pace of rate rises? Eurozone inflation is falling, the economy is on the brink of recession and interest rates are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. So many economists think it is time for the European Central Bank to switch to smaller rate rises at its meeting on Thursday. This means a third consecutive 75 basis point rate rise by the ECB seems unlikely. But the final decision may hinge on how quickly the bank expects inflation to return to its 2 per cent target in new forecasts it will publish after its December 15 meeting. Most economists expect the ECB to revise its inflation projections upwards for the next two years due to rising wages and the delayed impact of high energy costs hitting consumers. But most think the central bank will still forecast inflation returning to its target by 2025. Silvia Ardagna, chief European economist at Barclays, said this would allow the ECB to “slow the hiking pace to 50 basis points, considering that the 200 basis points of rate hikes delivered so far will have a significant effect on future inflation”.  However, some ECB watchers, such as ING head of macro research Carsten Brzeski, think a 75 basis point rate rise “is clearly still on the table”. But he added that a compromise could be found for a 50-point rate rise if it comes with “hawkish communication” and an agreement to start shrinking the ECB’s €5tn bond portfolio early next year.

"The buyout cash crunch at Carlyle","Plus, JPMorgan resists efforts to depose Dimon and legal clients prolong the cheque","One thing to start: Bridgewater Associates is set to cap investments in its flagship vehicle and cut about 8 per cent of its workforce in the most significant shake-up of the world’s largest hedge fund since founder Ray Dalio ceded control of the firm. And an update from the FT Business of Football Summit: European football must end the dominance of top teams or risk a crash in the valuation of clubs, Stephen Pagliuca, a big sports investor and senior adviser at buyout firm Bain Capital, has warned. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Carlyle’s fundraising strugglesJPMorgan says Dimon shouldn’t be deposedLaw clients put off bills A Carlyle effort to raise buyout cash falls short When Carlyle Group announced the hiring of former Goldman Sachs co-president Harvey Schwartz as chief executive last month, the private equity firm’s co-founder William Conway acknowledged that the six-month search for a new leader had taken a toll.  Schwartz’s appointment had “taken away some uncertainty” around Carlyle’s private equity fundraising efforts and should have a “positive impact”, Conway said. Behind the scenes, Carlyle’s efforts to raise a new $22bn buyout fund had nearly ground to a halt. But as Schwartz now works to steady ship, the New York and Washington-based group continues to face headwinds. A complex deal engineered by Carlyle during its leadership vacuum in part to raise cash for its new buyout fund has underwhelmed, DD’s Antoine Gara, Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Tabby Kinder report. Carlyle co-founder William Conway expects fundraising pressures to ease with the naming of a new chief executive © Bloomberg Since August, Carlyle has been working on a deal offering investors who bought into its $18.5bn buyout fund in 2018 a chance to sell their stakes . . . on one condition: buyers of the second-hand stakes would pay 81 cents on the dollar and also plough half that amount into the new fund, known as Carlyle Partners VIII. These “tender offers” typically garner sales of about 10 per cent of the fund’s assets, but the Carlyle effort had far lower participation as pricing fell. The deal received only about $500mn in sales orders, or a take-up rate of about 3 per cent, according to people briefed on the matter, far less than the $1bn plus originally expected.   As a result, Carlyle raised just a few hundred million dollars for the new buyout vehicle, which has raised $14bn of a $22bn target since fundraising began in the autumn of 2021. The firm has asked for a fundraising extension, the FT previously reported.  The results add to challenges at Carlyle as Schwartz works to find stability after a period of uncertainty and poor stock market performance.  DD sees one silver lining from the deal, though, which was also designed to offer investors liquidity: at 81 cents, the vast majority of Carlyle investors won’t sell, signalling confidence in its portfolio. Prices fell as worsening private market conditions late last year caused some investors to balk. The deal has angered some investors, however, causing them to question whether it was designed to overcome fundraising challenges.  “[This] establishes a market value for the stakes which is pretty low,” said one investor who chose not to sell their stakes at the discounted 81 cent price. At that price, selling would’ve meant exiting the relatively young fund with virtually no gains. Carlyle had sold off $1.4bn in investments and was marked at a fair value of $21.5bn, or a 1.3 times gain.  “They are doing it because they can’t raise capital the old-fashioned way,” said one executive following the process. JPMorgan doesn’t want Dimon deposed  Jamie Dimon has been an enduring presence at JPMorgan Chase as its chief executive for almost two decades.  But the “forever CEO” isn’t the “appropriate deponent” when it comes to discussing matters of Jeffrey Epstein, the bank claims. JPMorgan is resisting attempts by lawyers to question Dimon under oath in litigation over the US bank’s decision to keep the deceased paedophile as a client for 15 years. In a response filed to the court on Tuesday, lawyers for JPMorgan claimed Dimon was “not relevant” to lawsuits brought by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein had a home. It added that “he was not involved in any decisions regarding Epstein’s account”. JPMorgan declined to comment on the latest filing. JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon © Bloomberg The bank did, however, agree to find a date in March for a deposition of Mary Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management unit where Epstein was a client. DD readers may remember her as a crucial player in an internal battle at the bank over who would manage baseball legend Alex Rodriguez’s multimillion-dollar fortune. USVI lawyers will also interview Mary Casey, another private banker at JPMorgan in the period before the lender eventually dropped Epstein as a client in 2013. One email unearthed from the hundreds of thousands of documents disclosed in discovery last month has stuck with USVI lawyers: “I would count Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for ‘08 ($120mm [sic] or so?) as I can’t imagine it will stay (pending Dimon review).” The sender is not specified. JPMorgan countered last week: “We have found no evidence of, nor does [Dimon] recall, such a review.” Law clients put off paying the bills It’s feeling a little grim out there, and law firms are noticing. Their clients have started asking for payment plans and writedowns on bills as they adapt to rising costs. The bosses of three big law firms told the FT’s Kate Beioley and Joe Miller that clients were seeking discounts on bills, putting off paying, or in some cases — failing to pay at all. It’s a sign that rising interest rates and inflation are taking a toll on businesses the world over. “We had a number of clients who said ‘I’m not going to pay you all that now, I’ll do it over a different timeframe,’” said Tamara Box, Reed Smith’s Europe and Middle East managing partner. The head of one large US law firm said that some clients weren’t paying their fees at all in hard-hit sectors, including technology. But let’s not feel too sorry for them. According to Richard Burcher, the founder of law firm pricing consultancy Validatum, law firms raised their rates last year when inflation started to soar. So any discounts are probably on healthy levels.

"US stocks fall as rate rise debate continues and Big Tech job losses pile up","Chinese real estate stocks soar after Beijing announces measures to help indebted market","US stocks fell on Monday as investors weighed the outlook for interest rate rises following comments from Federal Reserve officials, and news of planned job cuts at Amazon added another name to a list of Big Tech dismissals. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 lost 0.9 per cent on Monday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite decreased 1.1 per cent, as investors dialled back some of the enthusiasm that was displayed in a rally late last week induced by better than forecast inflation data. The S&P 500 added 6.4 per cent on Thursday and Friday and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 9.3 per cent, its biggest two-day gain since 2008.  The moves came after annual US consumer price growth slowed to 7.7 per cent in October, less than the 8 per cent expected by economists. The reading eases pressure on the Fed to increase its main policy rate by 0.75 percentage points when it next meets in December, having implemented four such rises in a row in an aggressive campaign to tame historically high rates of inflation. Fed vice-chair Lael Brainard on Monday acknowledged the US central bank still has “additional work to do” in its fight against inflation, even as she backed slowing the pace of future rate increases.  She said the Fed should “soon” bring its string of supersized interest rate increases to an end, but cautioned a slower pace of tightening did not mean policymakers were backing off in their efforts to tackle price pressures. Over the weekend, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco branch of the Fed, warned the next phase of policymaking would be “difficult”. “You have to be mindful of the cumulative tightening that’s already in the system. You have to be mindful of the lags in monetary policy,” Daly told the Financial Times. “You have to be mindful of the risks that are all throughout the global economy and the tremendous uncertainty that we have, even about what the evolution of inflation is going to be.” Fed governor Chris Waller told a UBS conference in Australia on Monday morning that rates were going to “keep going up” and “stay high for a while until we see this inflation get down closer to our target”.  Shares of Amazon fell 2.3 per cent on Monday following reports it would cull 10,000 corporate employees, the largest dismissals in the company’s history. The news, first reported by The New York Times, is the latest in a wave of Big Tech job cuts, with Meta, Twitter, and Stripe just some of the companies that have announced significant job losses. In government bond markets, the yield on two-year US Treasuries rose 0.08 percentage points to 4.41 per cent, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note added 0.04 percentage points to 3.87 per cent. Yields rise when prices fall. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six others, added 0.5 per cent, recovering some of its losses last week.  In Europe, the regional Stoxx Europe 600 index added 0.1 per cent, consolidating a more than 3 per cent rise last week. London’s FTSE gained 0.9 per cent.  Germany’s Dax rose 0.6 per cent and has now climbed by a fifth since its September low. Data out on Monday indicate industrial production in the eurozone rose 0.9 per cent in September, higher than the 0.3 per cent rise forecast by economists.  Shares in China-related real estate stocks soared after Beijing pivoted to support the country’s indebted property sector and softened its longstanding zero-Covid policy.   The Hang Seng Mainland Properties index added as much as 13.7 per cent. Hong Kong-listed Country Garden, China’s biggest developer, shot up 45 per cent. The broader Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 1.7 per cent, trimming gains after rising as much as 3.9 per cent. China’s CSI 300 finished 0.2 per cent higher. Japan’s Topix lost 1 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.3 per cent.","14.11.2022"
"FirstFT: A new era for Netflix","Also in today’s newsletter, policymakers pledge to ‘stay the course’ on inflation and Davos praises Biden’s green package","Good morning. This article is an on-site version of our FirstFT newsletter. Sign up to our Asia, Europe/Africa or Americas edition to get it sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning Good morning. Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, is stepping down as chief executive, he announced last night after the streaming company released its latest quarterly results. After helping to launch Netflix as a DVD-by-mail service Hastings transformed it into one of the most powerful studios in Hollywood. In a blog post last night he said it was time to “complete my succession”. Chief operating officer Greg Peters has been promoted to co-chief executive alongside Ted Sarandos, who was in charge of programming during Netflix’s massive investment period and promoted in 2020 to co-chief executive alongside Hastings.   The change at the top of Netflix’s follows one of its most difficult years. It ended 2022 with 231mn paid subscribers, up 8mn for the year which was the slowest annual growth in a decade. Netflix stunned investors in April by revealing its decades-long growth spurt had come to an end, forcing it to take steps to shore up its business. It introduced a cheaper ad-supported streaming service, in partnership with Microsoft, and announced a crackdown on password sharing. Last night Netflix said it was “pleased with the early results” of its new service as it announced fourth-quarter net income dropped to $55mn from $607mn in the same period the year before. But investors welcomed news that 7.7mn new subscribers had joined to the platform in the final three months of last year, sending shares 6 per cent higher in after-hours trading. Five more stories in the news 1. Central bankers pledge to ‘stay the course’ on their anti-inflation fight Investors have been put on notice that central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic will “stay the course” to cool down their economies and tame high inflation. Comments yesterday from officials at the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve stoked expectations of more interest rate rises. Interest rate clash: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman diverge on how the Fed should combat high inflation. 2. Praise for Biden’s green package Delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos were united in praise for the US president’s Inflation Reduction Act. Cashing in on the $369bn package of financial support that includes subsidies for renewable investments, Republican and Democrat governors and members of Congress made the trip to the Swiss resort.  3. Genesis files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy The cryptocurrency broker has become the latest casualty of the fallout from the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s digital asset exchange FTX after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York yesterday. Genesis halted customer withdrawals in November following the crash at FTX and has since been in talks with creditors to recover billions of dollars worth of lost investments. 4. Japan’s inflation rises at record pace Japan’s core inflation rate rose to a new 41-year high of 4 per cent last month on the back of a weaker yen and heavy exposure to the increasing cost of imported commodities. The reading adds to mounting market pressure on the Bank of Japan to abandon its yield curve control policy which has helped maintain ultra-low interest rates. 5. UBS on hiring hunt The Swiss lender is planning to pick off disgruntled dealmakers from investment banking boutiques as it looks to bolster its capabilities in mergers and acquisitions. The moves come as Wall Street rivals cut thousands of jobs, reversing years of strong hiring. EU bankers benefit from Brexit: The number of EU bankers earning more than €1mn hit a record in 2021 as investment banking boomed and Brexit pushed more staff to continental Europe.

What else we are reading A defence of democratic capitalism In an age of populist demagoguery, “illiberal democracy”, personalised autocracy and China’s institutionalised despotism, will democratic capitalism — the marriage of liberal democracy and market capitalism — endure, asks Martin Wolf in this weekend essay ahead of the publication of his new book. ‘Four is the new two’ The Davos elite used to view a 2 per cent inflation rate as normal, not least because it was embedded in central bank targets. But that has now changed, writes Gillian Tett, who has been talking this week to executives and policymakers at the World Economic Forum. “The base has changed,” she writes.  Putin is losing the energy war After weaponising gas supplies, Russian president Vladimir Putin is now on the back foot as prices plummet while Europe remains well-stocked for this time of year, writes David Sheppard.

"Case for blockchain in financial services dented by failures","Despite high-profile experiments going awry in 2022, some banks are still committed to the technology","A number of high-profile blockchain experiments in banking and finance have ended in failure this year, undermining the case for the technology’s future in financial services. The biggest blunder came from the Australian Stock Exchange, which in November abandoned a plan announced seven years ago to upgrade clearing and settlement of shares to a blockchain-based platform. The exchange booked a A$250mn ($168mn) charge and apologised after admitting it needed to start the project again from scratch. Other initiatives in insurance, banking and shipping have also collapsed, suggesting that shared digital ledgers may fall flat in the quest to reform cumbersome operations. Even proponents of the technology warn that adopters should be prepared for multiple failures.  “We are forever coming up with new ideas and killing them if they’re not appropriate,” said David Newns, head of Six Digital Exchange, which issued the first digital bond on a distributed ledger in November. “We’re in the invention space, so we have to think of new things with the expectation that a lot of those ideas will fail.” In July B3i, a consortium of 15 insurance and reinsurance companies, ceased activities and filed for insolvency. The project had aimed to reduce inefficiency in premium and claims settlement, and place contracts on blockchains.  We.trade, another blockchain consortium of 12 banks focusing on trade finance also entered insolvency in June. The project had included Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Santander, Société Générale and UBS. Most recently, Maersk and IBM announced in late November they were discontinuing TradeLens, a supply-chain blockchain solution for the shipping industry, saying it had not “reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations”. The failures have come alongside the crisis that has engulfed many of the crypto companies that tried to build their businesses trading and lending digital tokens such as bitcoin. That culminated in the collapse in November of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange — a failure that has undermined the case for buying tokens in the hope of making a profit. Still, some banks remain committed to blockchain technology. “There’s lots of negative sentiment about cryptocurrencies, most recently because of FTX,” said Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs. “That has nothing to do with the underlying technology.”  Goldman, rivals such as JPMorgan and other financial institutions are still open to blockchain technology, citing its potential for efficiency gains and cost savings. JPMorgan has promoted its Onyx digital asset platform, which links other banks and financial institutions such as Visa, and handles payments linked to about $1bn of assets a day in currencies and bonds. But even some of those groups that have gone furthest with blockchain are cautious about its ultimate potential. In November, the European Investment Bank issued its second digital bond using the technology — a €100mn two-year deal arranged by Goldman Sachs, Santander and Société Générale.  Using the technology can potentially help streamline issues around documentation and payments but Xavier Leroy, senior funding officer at the EIB’s non-core currencies and special transactions division said the advantages were so far limited. “Given that we are in the initial stages, at the moment there aren’t many [benefits] — it’s mostly about potential for the future,” he said.  Some blockchain-related projects are also highly reliant on existing systems rather than replacing them, particularly so-called distributed ledgers that allow a select group of actors such as banks to share information on an immutable record.  This activity is related to blockchains and crypto assets but does not involve creating and verifying transactions in return for token rewards — a crucial difference from the blockchain on which bitcoin and other tokens are based. HSBC, for instance, describes the FX Everywhere system that it uses to settle currency with Wells Fargo — which has handled more than $200bn of five currencies — as “blockchain-based”. Even so, its distributed ledger technology (DLT) relies on Traiana, a well-established market infrastructure, to act as the first step in the system.  “There is a definition element. Even though we say DLT, people hear blockchain, blockchain, blockchain,” said Mark Williamson, global head of FX partnerships and propositions at HSBC.  FX Everywhere uses consensus algorithms, cryptographic signing and other crypto-related processes. But it “doesn’t require a blockchain”, Williamson said. It also represents a tiny proportion of the overall business that HSBC and Wells Fargo handle in their currency trading operations.A group of technology experts in June told US lawmakers that such “append-only” digital databases were not new. “They have been known and used since 1980 for rather limited functions,” they said. Responsibilities to shareholders and regulation can also inhibit banks from using the types of blockchains that underpin tokens such as bitcoin.These blockchains generally require maintenance by networks of computers that use vast amounts of power, in a controversial process called “proof of work”, but shareholders and regulators are pushing companies to invest in projects that are more environmentally friendly.  Banks are equally conscious they would have to navigate the different ways jurisdictions recognise tokenised investment products. In December, another Swiss stock exchange, BX Swiss, said it had completed a test trade of tokenised assets on a distributed public blockchain. However, it admitted it would require a separate market licence from the Swiss regulator to proceed. “The challenge is when a set of institutions come together and individual shareholders need to be committed to the journey,” said Keith Bear, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “If priorities change and they don’t hit targets, projects fail.” Cryptocurrencies: how regulators lost control  Letter in response to this article: Here’s another diagnosis of recent blockchain mishaps / From Alisa DiCaprio, Chief Economist, R3; Former Chair, Fintech Committee at the US Department of Commerce, New York, NY, US","30.12.2022"
"Gold buyers binge on biggest volumes for 55 years","China and Russia have been large accumulators of the precious metal in 2022, analysts say","Central banks are scooping up gold at the fastest pace since 1967, with analysts pinning China and Russia as big buyers in an indication that some nations are keen to diversify their reserves away from the dollar. Data compiled the World Gold Council, an industry-funded group, has shown demand for the precious metal has outstripped any annual amount in the past 55 years. Last month’s estimates are also far larger than central banks’ official reported figures, sparking speculation in the industry over the identity of the buyers and their motivations.The flight of central banks to gold “would suggest the geopolitical backdrop is one of mistrust, doubt and uncertainty” after the US and its allies froze Russia’s dollar reserves, said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, a gold marketplace.The last time this level of buying was seen marked a historical turning point for the global monetary system. In 1967, European central banks bought massive volumes of gold from the US, leading to a run on the price and the collapse of the London Gold Pool of reserves. That hastened the eventual demise of the Bretton Woods System that tied the value of the US dollar to the precious metal.  Last month the WCG estimated the world’s official financial institutions have bought 673 tonnes. And in the third quarter alone central banks bought almost 400 tonnes of gold, the largest three-month binge since quarterly records began in 2000.  The conservative estimates from the WGC outstrip the reported purchases to the IMF and by individual central banks, which stands at 333 tonnes in the nine months to September.Officially, the buying in the third quarter was led by Turkey at 31 tonnes, taking gold to about 29 per cent of its total reserves. Uzbekistan followed with 26 tonnes, while in July Qatar made its largest monthly acquisition on record since 1967.The discrepancy between the WGC’s estimates and officially reported figures tracked by the IMF can be partly explained by government agencies besides the central banks in Russia, China and others that can buy and hold gold without reporting them as reserves.  Acknowledging its intake — but also possibly trying to signal its limited role — the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) reported earlier this month that in November it made its first increase in gold holdings since 2019, with a 32-tonne bump worth about $1.8bn. Yet the gold industry says Chinese buying is almost certainly higher.  Mark Bristow, chief executive of Barrick Gold, the world’s second-largest gold miner, said China had bought tonnes of gold around the high-200s mark, based on his discussions with numerous sources.  Nicky Shiels, metals strategist at MKS PAMP, a precious metals trading company, added gold prices would have peaked around $75 lower in November if the PBoC had only purchased 32 tonnes. Gold prices traded as high as $1,787 a troy ounce in November and have since advanced above $1,800. For Russia, sanctions have created significant problems for its gold mining industry — the largest in the world after China — in selling overseas. It produces roughly 300 tonnes each year but has a domestic market for only 50 tonnes, according to MKS PAMP.  At the same time, western governments have frozen $300bn of Russia’s foreign currency reserves through sanctions, which Shiels says has prompted nations outside the west to ask: “Should we have exposure to so many dollars when the US and western governments can confiscate that at any time?”  Russia’s gold-buying repeats South Africa’s playbook during Apartheid-era sanctions of supporting domestic mining by buying the yellow metal using local currency, says Ash. “With limitations on the export side, it would make sense it’s the Russian central bank,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS. The Central Bank of Russia stopped reporting monthly numbers on its reserves soon after the war began. CBR officials have rejected the suggestion it is buying gold.  “Our gold and foreign exchange reserves are sufficient. We don’t have a specific task of accumulating gold and foreign exchange reserves,” said CBR governor Elvira Nabiullina in mid-December.  Yet CBR officials have long placed strategic value on boosting gold reserves; in 2006 it said it would be desirable for gold to make up 20-25 per cent of its holdings — in February 2022, the last time CBR published its statistical data, gold accounted for 20.9 per cent. It has reduced its holdings of US Treasuries to only $2bn from more than $150bn in 2012, while increasing gold reserves by more than 1,350 tonnes worth almost $80bn at current prices, according to Julius Baer, a Swiss private bank.  Carsten Menke, head of next generation research at Julius Baer, reckons the purchases from Russia and China indicate a growing reluctance for countries to rely on the greenback.   “The message these central banks are sending by putting a larger share of their reserves in gold is that they don’t want to be reliant on the US dollar as their main reserve asset,” Menke said.  Some in the industry speculate Middle Eastern governments are using fossil fuel export revenues to buy gold, most likely through sovereign wealth funds. The coming months will test whether record central bank buying was an opportunistic spurt as gold prices fell, or a more structural shift. Even with prices having since recovered to about $1,800 per troy ounce, few are willing to bet the trend towards diversification of central bank reserves will change course any time soon.  Bernard Dahdah, senior commodities analyst at Natixis, the French investment bank, said deglobalisation and geopolitical tensions meant the drive by central banks outside of the west to diversify away from the US dollar was “a trend that won’t change for a decade at least”.

"US stocks end month with gains as traders await Fed meeting","Investors scrutinise earnings for clues on how corporate America is faring","US stocks notched a gain in October after two consecutive months of declines, bucking weaker earnings growth, persistent inflation and expectations of more sharp rate rises by the Federal Reserve.  Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 climbed 8 per cent during the month, its first monthly increase since July. On Monday the stock index fell 0.7 per cent.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 3.9 per cent in October, after closing down 1 per cent in Monday’s trading.   Morgan Stanley analysts attributed the recent gains in part to technical reasons, such as a lack of companies that posted weak earnings updating their guidance for the next 12 months. Large passive investors did not sell off shares because consensus estimates for the next four quarters were mostly unchanged.  Market participants are also keeping an eye on policy meetings at the Bank of England and the Fed this week. The US central bank is forecast to implement its fourth straight 0.75 percentage point rate rise on Wednesday and to signal further increases in an effort to curb rapid price growth even as concerns mount that the country could enter a recession next year.  “While the Fed has hawkishly surprised most investors this year, we’ve now reached a point where both bond and stock markets may be pricing in too much hawkishness,” the Morgan Stanley analysts said in explaining stocks’ recent strength.   The Fed’s preferred inflation metric, the core personal consumption expenditures index, rose 0.5 per cent month on month for September, data on Friday showed. That was in line with economists’ expectations and down from 0.6 per cent in August. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the latest inflation figures meant it was “too early” for the Fed to follow the Bank of Canada or the European Central Bank in issuing “less hawkish signals”.  Investors have also been watching corporate earnings season for any signs of strain from high inflation and rising borrowing costs. Companies listed on the S&P 500 have so far reported year-on-year earnings growth of 2.2 per cent for the third quarter, according to FactSet data, which took into account groups that have reported and estimates for those that have not. That would mark the lowest rate of profit expansion since the third quarter of 2020.  Tech companies including Amazon, Facebook owner Meta and Google parent Alphabet have disappointed investors in recent days with their third-quarter results and guidance.  The energy sector is reporting earnings growth of 134 per cent, however. Companies including Pfizer, Airbnb and Uber report on Tuesday. In government bond markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note added 0.04 percentage points to 4.05 per cent as its price fell. The yield on 10-year German Bunds gained 0.05 percentage points to 2.15 per cent. Consumer price inflation in the eurozone rose to a record 10.7 per cent in October, higher than the 10.2 per cent predicted by economists polled by Reuters and up from 9.9 per cent in September. Gross domestic product rose 0.2 per cent in the euro area in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, figures from Eurostat show.   Agnès Belaisch, managing director and chief European strategist at the Barings Investment Institute, said a period of stagflation — low growth coupled with relatively high inflation — remained her base-case scenario for Europe, despite the better than expected GDP figures. In equity markets, the regional Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.4 per cent. London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.7 per cent, erasing an earlier loss. In Asia, Japan’s Topix gained 1.6 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi added 1.1 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1.2 per cent, while China’s CSI 300 lost 0.9 per cent.","31.10.2022"
"Uzbekistan lobbies EU to lift sanctions on Alisher Usmanov","Tashkent backs Uzbek-Russian oligarch in challenging punitive measures imposed after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine","Uzbekistan is lobbying the EU to lift sanctions on Alisher Usmanov and his sister as the Uzbek-Russian billionaire struggles to disentangle himself from the fallout of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Usmanov was one of 26 Russians hit with EU sanctions in the immediate days following Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, with the bloc claiming he was one of the Russian president’s “favourite oligarchs”. His sister Gulbakhor Ismailova was also hit with sanctions on grounds that she was the legal owner of some of Usmanov’s assets, such as his $600mn yacht Dilbar.  Tashkent has used recent meetings between Uzbek and EU officials to raise concerns about the sanctions, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The central Asian country is also providing legal assistance to Usmanov for a potential court challenge against Brussels if the bloc rejects the requests to have the restrictions lifted. Usmanov, who was worth about $20bn before Putin’s invasion, has maintained his close connections with Uzbekistan, where he was born. Tashkent has argued that the sanctions against him, which include an asset freeze and travel ban, have restricted the billionaire’s ability to invest some of his fortune in the country. Uzbekistan’s embassy in Brussels said in a statement that it “does not comment on situations relating to the protection of the interests of its citizens,” adding: “Alisher Usmanov is one of Uzbekistan’s most famous citizens. His actions serve as an example, and his generosity and the good faith are an object of admiration for our compatriots. It is difficult to identify areas in which Mr Usmanov has not helped his homeland.” A spokesperson for Usmanov said: “We cannot comment on the actions of the Uzbek government, but sanctions are indeed hampering investment and charity projects.” Usmanov started making his fortune while a senior director at Russian state gas company Gazprom in the 1990s, leveraging that role to build an industrial conglomerate involved in steel, copper, telecoms, technology and media. Both Usmanov and Ismailova have lodged official appeals against the EU restrictions, alongside more than a dozen other Russian oligarchs.  The lobbying from Tashkent comes at a time when the EU is seeking to build closer ties with Uzbekistan and other central Asian countries as the region reassesses its relationship with Russia in light of the war in Ukraine. Any move to lift sanctions against Usmanov and Ismailova would require unanimous approval by all 27 EU members, and would potentially open up similar debates about dozens of other dual national Russian oligarchs subject to sanctions, multiple EU officials told the Financial Times. “Mr Usmanov has reportedly fronted for President Putin and solved his business problems,” the EU wrote in its initial justification for imposing sanctions on the businessman on February 28. “Therefore he actively supported materially or financially Russian decision makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.” A spokesperson for the European Commission said it does not comment on meetings between the bloc and third countries, and discussions on sanctions issues were confidential. “The EU sanctions regime provides for all listed individuals and entities a possibility to legally challenge the listing at the European Court of Justice,” said Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy. German police on Tuesday raided offices of Swiss bank UBS in Frankfurt and Munich in connection with a money laundering investigation into Usmanov. A spokesperson for Usmanov “categorically” rejected any allegations of money laundering or tax evasion on his part.  The 156-metre-long Dilbar, the world’s biggest superyacht, was detained by Germany in March, days after the sanctions were imposed. Properties linked to Usmanov in Germany were raided by police in September. Usmanov’s other sister Saodat Narzieva was removed from the EU’s sanctions list in September after successfully appealing against what her representatives said were decisions “based on false accusations”. The EU initially justified its sanctions against Narzieva on reports by the Guardian newspaper and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project citing what they claimed were documents connecting her to bank accounts linked to Usmanov. The bloc also fears that detailed examinations of individual sanctions could spark a debate on the overall legality of its decision to punish business people for Putin’s war and on the supporting evidence it has provided to justify the sanctions.","09.11.2022"
"Pfizer pins hopes on record pipeline to recover from post-Covid hangover","Pharma group is launching 19 drugs over the next 18 months to counteract a sharp fall in sales from pandemic highs","Pfizer won plaudits from scientists and investors during the pandemic by developing highly effective Covid-19 vaccines and treatments that saved millions of lives and generated record sales.    But as the Covid emergency recedes, the US drugmaker is struggling to convince Wall Street that it can manage a transition that it forecasts will slash annual revenues by almost a third to about $70bn this year. Pfizer expects sales of Comirnaty, the Covid vaccine it developed with German company BioNTech, and its antiviral pill Paxlovid, to fall 62 per cent to $21.5bn in 2023, compared to last year.   It also faces a patent “cliff” — the loss of market exclusivity for several blockbuster drugs, including cancer medicines Xtandi and Ibrance. This is expected to blow an additional $17bn hole in annual revenues by 2030.  These challenges have made investors question whether the 174-year-old company can plug the revenue gap, even as it launches a record 19 drugs over the next 18 months in search of growth. Pfizer shares have slid nearly 16 per cent to $43.21 since the start of the year and the company’s market capitalisation of $243bn has fallen by more than a quarter since it peaked in December 2021 during the height of the pandemic. © Vernon Yuen/NurPhoto via Reuters “The market remains nonplussed with Pfizer’s post-Covid story and limited business development in 2022,” said Evan Seigerman, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “Investors are looking for a transformative deal and simplified pipeline story — this is possible in the second half of 2023, but uncertain today.”  Seigerman said Pfizer’s expectations that Covid sales will rebound in 2024 — after US government stockpiles are exhausted and the market moves to a commercial footing allowing it to raise prices — may also be unrealistic.   At Pfizer’s glitzy new headquarters in New York, which is based in a 66-floor skyscraper called The Spiral on the banks of the Hudson River, no such doubts are evident. Last month the Pfizer team outlined a growth strategy centred on product launches, M&A and a rebound in Covid sales it predicted could last until the end of the decade.      Dave Denton, who joined Pfizer as chief financial officer in April from US retailer Lowe’s, told The Financial Times he is confident the company can manage the transition.  “What’s unique about Pfizer is no one’s really gone from a pandemic into kind of a stable, I’ll say, post-crisis stage of a pandemic. And with that, people don’t understand exactly what that means,” he said.  “Investors haven’t really spent a lot of time understanding the breadth of our pipeline and our capabilities in research and development . . . now we’re beginning to showcase that over the next 18 months.” In the past, the group has relied on mega mergers such as its $68bn purchase of Wyeth in 2009 to drive growth. But the White House’s tough approach on antitrust makes large deals much riskier. Instead, since becoming chief executive in 2019, Albert Bourla, has sought to transform the company from a diversified pharmaceutical conglomerate into a nimbler, science-led business. © Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune.TNS/ABACA via Reuters  The 19 drugs that are due to come to market this year and next are a mix of candidates developed by Pfizer scientists and external prospects acquired through bolt-on acquisitions or co-developed via partnerships with smaller biotechs.  They include several potential blockbusters capable of generating $1bn or more in annual sales, including treatments for respiratory disease RSV, migraine and blood cancer. “Elranatamab could potentially become a mega blockbuster,” said Chris Boshoff, chief development officer of Pfizer’s oncology and rare disease unit, referring to a drug candidate targeting multiple myeloma, a type of incurable blood cancer. He said Pfizer had made great progress in oncology over the past decade, building what was a pipeline of only two or three molecules into one of the largest therapeutic areas in the group. A new combination therapy targeting an aggressive form of prostate cancer is another drug with big potential and could be approved this year, said Boshoff. Pfizer’s expertise in mRNA — the core technology used in the Covid vaccine — also provides opportunities, he added.  But in the short term, Pfizer is reliant on its existing pipeline. It forecasts the 19 drug launches will generate about $20bn in annual revenues by 2030, enough to cover the hit to sales caused by the loss of exclusivity on six blockbuster drugs between 2024 and 2027.   Not everyone is convinced the pipeline will deliver, though. “We just struggle to align with Pfizer’s expectations. In very few categories are [the 19 drugs] either first in class or best in class. And that’s a problem,” said Colin Bristow, analyst at UBS, which downgraded Pfizer to a sell rating last month. He singles out two of Pfizer’s best prospects — the drug targeting RSV and an oral treatment for diabetes and obesity. The company forecasts the second of these could generate $10bn a year in sales.   These drugs face competition from the likes of GSK, Moderna and Eli Lilly and there is no evidence Pfizer has a particular edge, he said. “It’s a similar story across the board,” he added. Being first to market or best in class does not always guarantee success. Pfizer’s expertise in manufacturing, sales and marketing helped to make cholesterol-lowering Lipitor the best-selling drug in the world in the early 2000s, even though it was late to market.   It repeated this success with its Covid treatments and could do so again with its new drugs, said Louise Chen, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. “That [manufacturing] expertise will be important, especially with diabetes, which is more of a primary care market,” said Chen, adding that rivals Lilly and Novo Nordisk have experienced supply issues because of surging demand. Pfizer also has plenty of options to replenish its pipeline through M&A due to cash reserves amassed from sales of its Covid vaccines and drugs, she said.  The US drugmaker has spent almost $30bn on acquisitions over the past two years, snapping up Arena Pharmaceuticals, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Global Blood Therapeutics, ReViral and Trillium Therapeutics. It forecasts these deals should generate about $10bn a year in annual revenues by 2030.  Most analysts have praised Pfizer’s selection of acquisitions but some say it is moving too slowly on M&A, given that it still needs to buy companies capable of generating an extra $15bn in annual revenues by 2030 to meet its growth targets. “Pfizer has a lot of capacity to act, we estimate above $100bn. But they only did a couple of deals last year. That is not enough to move the needle,” said Seigerman. Finding and assessing prospects in the pharma market takes time, according to Denton, an experienced dealmaker who when working as chief financial officer at pharmacy giant CVS in 2018 oversaw its $68bn acquisition of Aetna. “We are not investing with a focus of driving synergies. We are investing with the focus of acquiring science that allows us to accelerate the development of medicines,” said Denton. He said the company could spend an extra $50bn to achieve the revenue goals it has set for 2030. Les Funtleyder, a healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management, said he expected Pfizer would make a series of acquisitions this year. These would likely focus on companies that are typically $10bn or below with products close to being commercialised, he said. “Pfizer is very good at selling but historically not renowned as having the R&D engine of a Merck or Lilly. And it takes time to change the culture,” said Funtleyder, whose fund owns shares in Merck and Lilly but not Pfizer.  “But they have a big portfolio of drugs and it just takes one of them, one wildly successful drug to become a mega blockbuster. And if they get that then everyone will say Bourla is a genius.”","21.02.2023"
"America’s dollar stores get a makeover","Santander is in talks to hire several of Credit Suisse’s most senior investment bankers","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘America’s dollar stores get a makeover’ Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, April 24th, and this is your FT News Briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING]  Spain’s biggest bank is trying to poach top Credit Suisse bankers. Rishi Sunak has to calm nerves on multiple fronts. And British therapists have mixed emotions about the expansion of a big US online therapy company. Plus, American dollar stores are adapting to an era when things cost a lot more than a dollar. I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Swiss banking giant UBS is in the process of integrating its rival Credit Suisse. And that tricky merger process is an opportunity for other banks to poach Credit Suisse bankers. FT sources say Spain’s top bank, Santander, held talks with Credit Suisse veteran David Hermer. Hermer is currently head of equity and debt capital markets and he’s been with Credit Suisse since 1994. Sources said Santander wants to hire dealmakers and junior employees to try and boost its investment banking presence in the EU and the US. [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, British prime minister Rishi Sunak will try and win back British business. He’s holding the first of several summits with corporate leaders and it’s part of the Conservative party’s effort to repair damage done by Brexit and fend off Labour party efforts to brand itself as more business-friendly. Sunak’s on damage control on the political front, too. His deputy, Dominic Raab, resigned on Friday. An independent report confirmed allegations that Raab had bullied civil servants. Raab denied the claims. The FT’s George Parker says this is the latest headache for a prime minister who promised transparency, accountability and integrity when he took office last autumn.  George ParkerSo some eyebrows were raised by the appointment of his first cabinet, which including three ministers around whom a number of allegations were swirling at the time. And subsequent to that, Nadhim Zahawi, the former chancellor, had to quit the cabinet because of problems over his tax affairs. Gavin Williamson, another cabinet minister, had to resign over allegations of bullying. And now the deputy prime minister has had to resign again after allegations of bullying were upheld by this independent inquiry. So it doesn’t look great for the judgment of Rishi Sunak. I think most people would say that Rishi Sunak is determined to lead a completely different government in terms of its character from the chaotic one led by Boris Johnson. And to be fair to Rishi Sunak, these allegations have led to ministers being dismissed or them resigning. But nevertheless, you know, it’s a reminder of the general view that this government may be is, has lost its bearings after nearly 13 years in power.  Marc FilippinoOK. So, George, what did Sunak do to right the ship at the moment and calm things down? And what does this mean for the UK general election that’s coming up next year?  George ParkerWell, he’s moved quickly to replace Dominic Raab as deputy prime minister, someone like Oliver Dowden, who’s a sort of fairly dry technocratic character, has become the deputy prime minister. Look, I mean, I think in the end the election will be judged on whether Rishi Sunak does some work to repair the damage that the British economy suffered as a result of Covid, Brexit as well, the war in Ukraine. And, you know, those are the things ultimately that decide how people vote. But I think allied to that, he needs to get over this very quickly because the one thing that the voters don’t want to see is a prime minister whose time is consumed by reading reports about ministers bullying officials rather than doing the day job of trying to sort out the economy and Britain’s rather ropey public services.  Marc FilippinoGeorge Parker is the FT’s political editor. [MUSIC PLAYING] Anywhere you go in the US, you’ll find a dollar store. They’ve long been a go-to for lower income Americans searching for cheap, dry goods and toiletries and stationery items. But recently, inflation has driven more middle-income consumers into their stores. And the FT’s Alexandra White reports two big chains, Dollar General and Dollar Tree, have invested a lot of money installing freezers and coolers.  Alexandra WhitePrices for food cost a lot more than they did a year ago. And more people are turning to these locations for food as they have slowly expanded more into the grocery arena. Dollar General last year, they offered produce in about 3,000 stores and this year they’re going to push that to selling produce in 8,000 of their stores. So they’re really looking at ways to attract consumers and potentially a different kind of consumer, more middle-income consumer who wouldn’t necessarily think about shopping at a dollar store. But when they have all of these essentials there for them, which is what consumers are spending on right now, then that’s where they’re going to gravitate to.   Marc FilippinoSo essentially, it sounds like more middle-income consumers have to search for bargains. And if they see that they can buy essentials like food at a dollar store, they’re gonna go there.  Alexandra WhiteRight, yeah. So dollar stores aren’t necessarily trying to become grocery stores because grocery stores have a lower profit margin. But they do want to expand into food because they’re using it to get people in the door. And their hope is that they can get people to spend money on groceries, on food, but also to spend money on some of their discretionary products, like household goods, like apparel, which has a higher profit margin.  Marc FilippinoSo these two big chains, Dollar Tree and Dollar General, are increasing their capital spending, so investment in their own stores. Now, if you look over at Walmart, the other big bargain retailer, their capital spending is flat. Alexandra, why are the dollar stores spending so much more on upgrading their own stores?  Alexandra WhiteThey’re making these necessary investments because they’re growing and because it’s a unique business model. I mean, Walmart can sort of meet customers online as well, or people are more likely to go drive long distances to go to a Walmart. But Dollar General and Dollar Tree, they’re all built around convenience. So they have to make sure that they have a large footprint. And I guess now they have to remodel the stores so that they fit into the company’s strategy.  Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s Alexandra White. [MUSIC PLAYING] In the US, online therapy has taken off, especially since the pandemic and all the demand for virtual mental health support during the pandemic. One of the biggest sites is betterhelp.com. It’s owned by a $4bn publicly listed company called Teladoc Health, which is now bringing BetterHelp to the UK. But therapists there have mixed emotions about the site. To find out more, I’m joined by the FT’s Ian Johnston. Hey, Ian. Ian JohnstonHi there.  Marc FilippinoSo Ian, as you report, BetterHelp has recruited about a thousand therapists in the UK. What’s the appeal?  Ian JohnstonI think it’s a really different way of working. They’ve got much more flexibility. They can choose their hours. It’s also luring people in with quite big bonuses. Some of those people I’ve spoken to were offered $1,000 bonuses to sign up and then they are told that they can make up to $100,000 per year. But that didn’t turn out to be the case for many of them.  Marc FilippinoOK. So that’s one of the big concerns you heard when you were reporting. Why were many therapists in the UK not able to make that level of income?  Ian JohnstonThe £100,000 a year would obviously be by working up to 40 plus hours on the platform. And the prospect of doing that would mean that you’re seeing 30 to 40 clients a week every week of the year without any break. That is very difficult for therapists, whether it’s reaching burnout and it just presents an unrealistic model for those people that it’s recruiting. And then on the other side of the coin, really, the clients could end up seeing therapists who are burned out, who are not suitable for them. There’s a sense that this is perhaps going to lead to worse quality care and a situation where as a client, you’re not being able to see people that are equipped or supported to meet your needs.  Marc FilippinoAre there other concerns besides working conditions and pay?  Ian JohnstonSome of the other concerns are related to how BetterHelp is selling itself. BetterHelp is telling people that all therapists are licensed and accredited. That didn’t turn out to be the case with the UK therapists because in the UK there’s no such thing as a licensed therapist. We don’t have the same system as the US. The issue with this obviously is that BetterHelp is offering something that doesn’t quite align with the service that it advertises. Another thing they’re worried about is client safety. There’s no support staff for these therapists in the UK. They have to wait for the US support team to wake up to connect to them. And there is also no real way of them being able to contact their clients but through the platform. They have to reach out, they have to get an emergency contact number. So there are those sort of client safety concerns as well.  Marc FilippinoWhat does BetterHelp have to say about this? Have they responded at all?  Ian JohnstonBetterHelp has said that it has got a rigorous employment process and that for those who need support, therapists who need support, they have an online community forum with other veteran therapists offering tips and education. They said that they got back to people within 48 hours and that they will provide clients’ contact details to therapists in the event of emergencies.  Marc FilippinoOK. So, Ian, what’s your big takeaway from all this reporting?  Ian JohnstonI think it’s a case of this company that’s growing exceptionally fast, that’s providing a gig economy model to an industry where you’re dealing with vulnerable people. And it feels like, from the therapists I’ve spoken to, there is a prioritising of growth over quality of care. Also with this expansion to the UK, as the licensing situation shows, there has not really been that understanding of the UK market.  Marc FilippinoIan Johnston is a technology reporter for the FT.

"How not to fire people","Badly done lay-offs at Twitter and elsewhere could wound the tech sector for years to come","Tech HR departments are out of their depth. After years of throwing money at anyone with a computer science degree or IT experience, companies are having to get rid of employees instead. Amazon and Meta, which owns Facebook, lead the pack for scale of job cuts, with more than 10,000 planned apiece, while Twitter is grabbing headlines for brutality and incompetence. New owner Elon Musk axed roughly 3,700 employees via email and immediately tried to rehire some of them, saying they had been let go by mistake. The firing spree goes beyond the big names: nearly 800 tech companies have announced redundancies since January, wiping out 120,000 jobs, including 25,000 just this month, according to layoffs.fyi, a tracking website.  Barring a few veterans who survived the dotcom crisis, tech workers have never seen anything like this. The way the cuts are handled could shape the sector’s culture for years to come. Normally, innovation and rapid growth require tech employees to keep the faith. They often work long hours and solve apparently impossible problems while waiting for financial rewards that can take years to arrive. Unexpected job losses, especially if they are handled cruelly, undermine any sense of shared sacrifice among not just the departed but those left behind. Technology companies faced with their first big culls should bear this in mind and learn lessons from other sectors. Banking is notorious for attracting many employees who care mostly about immediate personal gain. That’s why the reforms enacted after the 2008 financial crisis aimed to force staff to care about the consequences several years in the future. This short-termism was a natural consequence of decades of cyclical hiring and firing that sapped any sense of institutional loyalty. Banks spent decades staffing up in good times only to indiscriminately swing the axe in bad ones. And many of them did it in particularly unpleasant ways. In 2012, the Swiss bank UBS made clear how little individual feelings mattered. Some 100 fixed income traders based in London learnt they had lost their jobs when they got to the entry turnstiles and found their access passes turned off. The post-Covid version, as practised by Twitter and others, is to deactivate someone’s work Slack and email accounts before telling them they are being let go. Heartlessness sends the message that workers are expendable, so why should they put in effort that will not benefit them directly? At the same time, companies that show basic decency can reap benefits. When pandemic travel bans hit the US airline industry, Delta managed its financial crunch mainly with voluntary buyouts and unpaid leave, while American and United announced mass lay-offs. When air travel came back last summer, Delta had fewer problems with cancelled flights partly because the Atlanta-based carrier was able to staff back up more quickly.   Though the other carriers rescinded most of their job cuts after receiving government aid, their erstwhile employees took advantage of the hot job market and chose to go elsewhere. (Loyalty only goes so far: the Delta pilots’ union recently voted to strike to protest against long delays in contract negotiations.) While avoiding mass firings is ideal, many tech executives think this isn’t possible. Still, some ways of doing things are clearly better. Patrick Collison, chief executive of payments company Stripe, has recently won praise for his admission that he erred and for generous severance packages, while Brian Chesky provided outplacement support for departing workers as part of Airbnb’s 2020 job cuts.  Management experts say it is best to have one big round of cuts, with proper outplacement benefits, and be clear with employees about why the losses are needed and when they will stop. Being human and accessible helps. But don’t overdo it. Braden Wallake, chief executive of marketing agency HyperSocial, became a figure of online fun after posting a selfie of himself crying over lay-offs.  Above all, says Bob Sutton, a Stanford University organisational psychologist, don’t pretend that you are simply getting rid of poor performers: “Everybody knows it’s bullshit and in the future you may see them again. You may even want to hire them again.” Tech executives may also want to draw lessons from professional services firms, which have decades of experience in easing people out, due to their “up or out” employment structures.

"‘Biotech is the ultimate impact investment’ — family offices can’t get enough of it","Strong personal interest in healthcare among reasons for increase in flow of family office money into venture capital ","The Lauber family built its wealth in real estate, and that’s where it stayed for decades. But, lately, some of the family money has a buzzy new destination: biotech. “I’m kind of like a hypochondriac,” says Robin Lauber, the third-generation heir who is diversifying the Swiss family’s wealth, mainly into companies working in cutting-edge biology. Lauber, 30, is particularly interested in longevity medicine, a nascent strand of research that aims to slow down the ageing process. “I want to continue living as long as possible,” he says, pointing out that there are other animal species that have a lifespan of as long as 200 years.   Lauber is hardly alone among rich people seeking to use science to extend their lives. US tech billionaires are also pouring money into longevity projects, not least the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. And old age is only one focus in a wider movement of rich families’ money into healthcare. Around a fifth of single family offices have invested in healthcare or biotech in the past two to three years, according to Alastair Graham, who tracks the investments of some 2,145 single family offices through his database, Highworth Research. The vast majority of those investing in healthcare are in North America and Europe. Robin Lauber, a third-generation heir who is diversifying his Swiss family’s wealth, mainly into companies working in cutting-edge biology © Gabriel Hill for the FT “There is a tremendous movement into conversations about the healthcare space,” says Eric Casaburi, who chairs a Florida-based group of Tiger 21, a membership network of around 1,200 wealthy individuals who advise one another on investments and philanthropy. A survey of Tiger 21 members, who are based in the US, Britain, Canada, Switzerland and Portugal, found that nearly a quarter planned to invest in healthcare this year.  The emphasis on healthcare is reflected in the flow of family office money into venture capital — a fast-growing investment channel for young companies. A report in January by Campden Wealth and Silicon Valley Bank, the Californian lender that was rescued from collapse in March, found that, while overall family office investment in venture capital fell back in last year’s market turmoil, from a record $136.9bn in 2021 to $65bn, healthcare investment has remained robust. The report, which surveyed 139 ultra-high net worth families or family offices, identified popular healthcare themes including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for drug discovery and advances in cancer treatment.  Max Kunkel, chief investment officer for global family and institutional wealth in the global wealth management arm of UBS, the Swiss bank, says that healthcare appeals to family offices because three significant trends are driving growth and innovation in the sector: demographics; technological progress; and the unsustainable trajectory of healthcare costs.   “Family offices, especially the more established ones, have a very long term time horizon, and they look at broad trends,” he says. They are also willing to undertake the longer-term investments that are often needed in early-stage biotech because “they don’t fear illiquidity.”  The recent increase in healthcare investment by family offices comes despite the sector’s difficulties in the public markets, where it has suffered from the general move out of growth stocks. The Nasdaq biotechnology index is trading more than 20 per cent lower than its 2021 peak, compared with a decline of about 10 per cent in the wider S&P 500 for the same period. Lauber’s investment comes from a family fortune built by his grandparents, from property across Switzerland, mainly affordable housing. For two decades the family drew on the income generated by that portfolio without investing it more widely. Then, in 2015, Lauber set up a family office to put the money to work and made his first biotech investments in 2018.  The Lauber family office, Infinitas Capital, still invests in real estate. But about half of the family-office investment now goes into venture capital through two funds, Prediction Capital, which invests in consumer tech and fintech, and Korify Capital, a healthcare-focused fund. About 70 per cent of Korify’s investments are in biotech, and Lauber intends to increase that proportion over time. As well as longevity medicine, Korify focuses on mental health.  Meanwhile, Lauber says almost all his personal wealth — which comes separately from his own entrepreneurial activities, including bringing the US chain Dunkin’ Donuts to Switzerland — goes into biotech investment. Among Korify’s holdings is New York-based Gameto, which is applying cell-based therapies to areas such as fertility treatment and menopause-linked health problems. Another is Cambrian Bio, also based in New York, which is developing various drugs to target the biological drivers of ageing. New York-based biotech company Gameto is among Lauber’s investments  Lauber’s enthusiasm for biotech has proven contagious. He says he has brought about 30 other family offices and wealthy individuals, from Switzerland and further afield, including the UK and US, into Korify Capital. For most of them, he adds, this was their first foray into biotech.   Biotech comes with more risk than many other sectors. Scientific breakthroughs that show promise in test tubes and animals sometimes hit barriers when confronted with the complexities and quirks of the human body. Sometimes, innovations that seem to work when tested on a small group of people fall down when they move into larger, more robust trials.  In 2014, Oxford-based Circassia Pharmaceuticals, an allergy specialist, launched a £581mn initial public offering, a record at the time for a London-listed biotech. But it crashed two years later, after a large trial found its cat allergy treatment was no more effective than a placebo.  While well-connected wealthy investors can play a role in influencing the success or failure of companies in sectors such as real estate or finance — for example, through business contacts — have no levers to pull if the science says the treatment does not work.  Still, the rewards in healthcare can be substantial. The biggest shareholder in BioNTech, the German vaccine maker which partnered with Pfizer to produce one of the world’s most widely used Covid-19 shots, is the family office of twin brothers Thomas and Andreas Strüngmann, who, in 1986, founded generic drugmaker Hexal and later sold it to Novartis for about $7bn. In 2008, the Strüngmann brothers supported BioNTech with a €136.5mn seed investment in a €150mn round that enabled the founding of the company, according to Highworth Research.  They own 43.5 per cent of BioNTech through an investment vehicle called AT Impf, according to a recent SEC filing, making their stake worth around $14bn. “It’s a great example of the capacity of a single family office to deploy patient capital,” says Highworth’s Graham.  Examples such as this have helped Lauber to make the case to other family offices for investing in the sector. “Covid has shown them that biotech investing can be super rewarding,” he says. “Biotech is the ultimate impact investment.” As family offices embrace biotech, they are getting smarter about it. Over the past 10 years, family offices have become more professional in how they assess potential investments in healthcare, says Masha Strømme, a former investment banker and research scientist whose Oslo-based family office funds and mentors early-stage biotechs. Her family office’s holdings include Exact Therapeutics, which is developing the use of ultrasound to deliver cancer therapy more effectively. It’s not unusual now, even in the UK, for a company when on a fundraising trail to identify a handful of family officesNooman Haque, a life sciences investor based in the UK “PhDs in microbiology and biochemistry as well as medical doctors are now running investments for some of these family offices,” she says. “People are gearing up to know what they invest in,” she says. In the past, many family-office investments into biotech were made “with the heart” into diseases that affected a member of the family, or its close associates, she notes.  Biotech itself may be a relatively risky proposition, but there are ways of reducing risk. The buildings used by the sector, for example, could be a safer bet. That is the view of the Noé Group, the family office of the UK-based Noé family, which made its money in property and is now headed by Leo Noé, son of the founder, Salomon. In 2020, the Noé Group invested in a large campus in Eindhoven in the Netherlands that brings together laboratories, clean rooms and manufacturing facilities alongside spaces for offices and university lectures. The campus aims to attract a broad range of tenants, from universities to start-ups and larger companies, in order to create a scientific ecosystem.  Noé’s sons, Zvi and Raphael, first visited the site in 2018 and were ready to make an investment in early 2020. The pandemic delayed the investment by a few months, but it also helped to reinforce the case. While people stayed away from offices and retail spaces, laboratories and manufacturing sites were still humming.  Brothers Zvi and Raphael Noé are investing in property for use by life science companies © Ayesha Kazim for the FT Earlier this year, the Noé Group invested €30mn in three buildings with laboratory space in Madrid, Spain, and the brothers say they intend to further expand their portfolio of life science real estate. Life science is a sector with fast-growing space requirements, says David Bloom, Leo Noé’s son-in-law. That’s in part because biological research increasingly depends on sifting through enormous data sets produced by advances such as large scale genomic sequencing, and those data centres need space. “From a real estate perspective, that’s a good thing,” he says. Bloom’s arm of the Noé Group invests in data centres. Its portfolio includes the Kao Data Campus, in Harlow, which houses Cambridge-1, one of the most powerful computers in the UK.  The Covid-19 pandemic put life sciences under a spotlight, accelerating a growing interest in healthcare that was already under way among family offices, says Nooman Haque, a life sciences investor based in the UK. He says family offices have risen in prominence as sources of capital for venture funding rounds. “It’s not unusual now, even in the UK, for a company when on a fundraising trail to identify a handful of family offices,” he says. “That door has been opened a little bit.”  For some family offices, investment in healthcare is deeply personal, says Los Angeles-based Greg Suess, an adviser to Forbes 400 families for Activist Artists Management, a talent management and advisory group. A few years ago, Suess set up a fund whose key investment themes include the therapeutic applications of cannabis after several of his clients asked about it. Many had personal reasons for their interest, such as a relative with arthritis or anxiety. He says about 20 families are involved in the Activist Green Fund, which manages $2.2mn. “I got the life-science bug early on,” says veteran tech entrepreneur Hermann Hauser, who co-founded Acorn Computers in 1978, then the chipmaker Arm in 1990. His first meaningful foray into biotech was an early investment in Cambridge-based genome sequencing company Solexa, which was founded in 1998 and later acquired by San Diego-based Illumina for $600mn.  Hauser was impressed by the rate of progress: the cost of sequencing the human genome fell from $10mn to $1,000 — or a factor of 10,000 — between 2007 and 2014. By comparison, the cost of semiconductors took a decade to reduce by a factor of 30, he says. His conclusion: “Computing is incredibly slow compared to life sciences.”  Since then, Hauser has been a key investor in life sciences, both through his family office and the venture capital firm that he co-founded, Amadeus Capital Partners. He says his personal portfolio is split equally between bioscience and tech. Many figures from the tech world are putting their money into healthcare. Bezos is reported to be a key investor in Altos Labs, a start-up with sites in San Francisco, San Diego and Cambridge, UK, which says its mission is to use “cellular rejuvenation programming to reverse disease, injury and the disabilities that can occur throughout life”. In 2021, PayPal founder and billionaire, Peter Thiel invested heavily in Utah-based Blackrock Neurotech, which aims to help neurologically impaired patients regain lost skills.

Fidji Simo, chief executive of the delivery company Instacart © David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Paul Kessler and Diana Derycz-Kessler, a husband-and-wife team who are longtime investors in biotech and also founded the Los Angeles Film School, prefer to invest in later-stage public companies via private investment in public equities, or Pipe. During the 1990s, Kessler was one of the pioneers of this investment style, where companies issue shares to private investors directly, rather than through the stock market, although those shares may subsequently be traded publicly. Kessler says Pipe investing allows him to get closer to the management teams and better understand the science.  He says the majority of the couple’s investments are in biotech, although they also invest in energy and tech. “What fascinated me about biotechnology and drug development was how it could extend, improve and create happier lives for people who’ve been afflicted by a horrible disease,” he says. “How many can say they don’t know someone afflicted by cancer?”  Paul Kessler and Diana Derycz-Kessler, a husband-and-wife team, prefer to invest in later-stage public companies via private investment in public equities, or Pipe © Wray Sinclair for the FT Sometimes, the personal aspect comes later. A few years ago, the Kesslers invested in Iovance Biotherapeutics, a cancer immunotherapy company whose most advanced experimental treatment is for melanoma. They were impressed by the science behind the company, which arose from research conducted at the National Cancer Institute in the US under top scientist Steven Rosenberg. After investing in Iovance, Kessler received a melanoma diagnosis, which has since been treated successfully by surgery. He says: “Because of my melanoma diagnosis — and thereafter surgery — that became very personal.”  This article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment","15.05.2023"
"Fund managers position to woo investors back to bonds","Fixed income outflows have slowed as inflation eases and hopes rise of an end to jumbo Fed interest rate rises","Bond fund managers struggling through one of their worst years in decades say the tide is turning as they position to woo investors attracted by higher yields. Nearly $480bn has flowed out of US fixed income mutual funds since the start of the year, according to the Investment Company Institute. While some money moved into exchange traded funds, the majority reflected retail investor flight during a period when bond prices fell sharply. However, outflows have slowed significantly in the past few weeks and even started to reverse in some areas, as investors began to hope that inflation will ease and the US Federal Reserve will stop increasing interest rates. Thursday saw the sharpest rise in prices for two-year Treasury notes, which are particularly sensitive to interest rates, since October 2008.   That has raised fund managers’ hopes that investors will feel the lure of bond prices that are significantly lower than a year earlier. “We are seeing a lot of renewed interest in our income strategies,” said Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pimco, the world’s largest bond-focused manager. “We’ve seen inflows in certain categories and a stabilisation in outflows . . . We’re seeing growth in our active funds.” The calculation is simple. Existing bond investors lost big this year as rising interest rates drove down the value of their holdings and cast doubt on fixed income as a hedge against volatile stocks. But for new investors, these products can now offer the highest yields in years.  “The environment for fixed income investors today is dramatically different to any that we have seen for quite some time,” said Marilyn Watson, who heads a global fixed income strategy team at BlackRock. “Investors can now achieve attractive levels of income in a risk-controlled manner, particularly in front-end, high quality credit.” Stephanie Butcher, chief investment officer at $1.3tn assetmanager Invesco, said: “The fixed income team is now as upbeat as I’ve seen them for a long time because the aggregate yields available both in investment grade and high-yield credit are the highest we’ve seen in years. Finally you’re being paid to take some risk.” That has fund managers salivating over the prospect that both institutional and retail investors might be open to trying different managers and products as they return to the debt markets.   “Money is in motion,” said Jason Brady, chief executive of Santa Fe based Thornburg Investment Management. “There’s a big opening.” ETFs have been growing in popularity: BlackRock has seen net inflows of $100bn into its bond ETFs this year despite the industry wide outflows. High-yield bond funds experienced net inflows of nearly $8bn in October, the most this year, according to Morningstar Direct. And those managing active portfolios hope to capitalise by promising investors higher yields with lower risk. “Now bonds are useful again,” said Peter Van Dooijeweert, head of multi-asset solutions at Man Group. There is precedent for a rapid recovery, said Gershon Distenfeld, co-head of fixed income at AllianceBernstein: corporate bond prices rebounded faster than stocks after the 2008 financial crisis. “Asset managers are anticipating flows will come back hard into fixed income and they are jockeying for position,” he said. “Everybody’s waiting for the Fed to stop [raising rates] and people are going to pile into fixed income when it does.”  Despite the rising enthusiasm after last week’s lower than expected inflation numbers, some economists and fund managers warned that difficult times for fixed income may not be over. “Maybe there is some light at the end of the tunnel. But this is going to depend a lot on what the Fed does,” said Sean Collins, the ICI’s chief economist. “We’ve been having these overly optimistic surges about the Fed for months now.”  Many economists are now predicting a recession, which would put strains on borrowers and increase the risk of default.  “Investors want to be cautious in the most economically sensitive areas of the market,” Pimco’s Ivascyn said. “The opportunity set is sufficiently high in the higher quality areas.” And Thomas Digenan, who heads Investment Solutions at UBS Asset Management, cautioned that forecasters are having a difficult time figuring out what to expect: “Normally the differentials between our different scenarios are not as great as they are today — uncertainty is much higher.” Still, Mike Gitlin, head of fixed income for Capital Group, which has seen small net inflows into its bond offerings this year, is optimistic. “I think we’ll look back and see 2022 as the year of losses and disinvestment, and 2023 as the year of opportunity and reinvestment.”  Additional reporting by Nicholas Megaw in New York and Harriet Agnew in London ","13.11.2022"

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Credit Suisse secures a backstopDisney re-evaluates its streaming portfolioExiled Chinese businessman is accused of fraud Swiss regulators intervene as Credit Suisse wobbles Credit Suisse on Wednesday was swept up in a brewing banking industry crisis that has felled three large US regional lenders and caused regulators to break the glass and activate emergency measures to ward off a full-blown crisis.  The Swiss lender spent parts of the day appealing to the Swiss National Bank and its local regulator Finma for public support as financial markets began assigning an increasingly dire outlook to its future. Credit Suisse shares slumped 24 per cent and spreads on its five-year credit default swaps — derivatives that ensure against it missing a payment on its debts — soared to crisis levels. But by nightfall in Zurich, Credit Suisse had begun discussions with both authorities on measures such as a central bank credit line or asset guarantee to restore market confidence. The Swiss central bank relented, agreeing to provide a liquidity backstop to Credit Suisse. It insisted there were “no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions due to the current turmoil in the US banking market”. Hours before markets opened on Thursday, Credit Suisse said it would tap that facility and borrow up to SFr50bn ($54bn) to strengthen its liquidity. On a private call on Wednesday, analysts from JPMorgan Chase raised the prospect of the SNB guaranteeing Credit Suisse’s retail and wealth management deposits and forcing it to sell its investment bank, people familiar with the call said.  But the analysts thought the most likely scenario, should Credit Suisse’s situation worsen, would be a sale to local rival UBS, one of the people said. Another possibility would be an equity injection by the SNB, they added. Ulrich Körner took the helm of Credit Suisse this past July with a bold restructuring plan that involved spinning off its advisory business. But its unsteady financial footing is threatening to unravel Körner’s efforts as wealthy clients continue to pull their money. Körner said the bank’s decision to borrow early on Thursday morning demonstrated its “decisive action” and that he was “resolved to move forward rapidly”. Nonetheless, ratings downgrades hang over the bank, which holds a negative credit outlook and has grown eerily close to junk status in recent years.  Adding to the troubles is the fact that its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, has ruled out providing any additional financial support.  Chair Ammar Alkhudairy said on Bloomberg TV that Saudi National Bank would refuse to invest more money into Credit Suisse: “The answer is absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason which is regulatory and statutory.” Credit Suisse’s plunge can also be traced to revelations that its auditor, PwC, had identified “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls, which delayed publication of its annual report last week. One person closely watching the unfolding drama is banker Michael Klein, who is set to lead the new advisory business, called Credit Suisse First Boston, after it merges with his own boutique firm. That’s contingent on Credit Suisse making it to mid-year, when the deal is expected to close. Klein will receive $175mn selling his operation to the bank. Additionally, a $10mn advisory fee, negotiated when he was still a Credit Suisse board director, also hangs in the balance.  Disney rethinks a Hulu happily ever after In Hulu’s hit series The Bear, a grieving chef leaves a toxic Michelin-starred restaurant to save his family’s Chicago sandwich shop, neither of which embrace him. Such is the plight of the streaming service itself, which, despite cranking out hits such as The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders In The Building, has struggled to find its place in the streaming landscape. As the platform’s majority owner, Disney, looks to slim down and refocus on profitability, speculation has intensified that the entertainment giant’s reinstated boss Bob Iger is considering selling it. ESPN, a profitable but declining piece of Disney’s portfolio, could also be up for grabs — though Iger has been more vocal about keeping it. Hulu launched in 2007 as a joint venture between NBCUniversal and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, as the traditional media groups sought to get into the streaming game. Disney bought a stake in Hulu in 2009 and when the Australian media mogul sold his 21st Century Fox empire to the company in 2018, its stake in the streaming service came with it. Until recently, the assumption across Hollywood and Wall Street was that Disney would soon move to consolidate its ownership of Hulu. In 2019, Disney agreed to take full control of the platform by buying NBC parent Comcast’s 33 per cent stake in the business. That deal allows either Comcast or Disney to force the transaction as early as January 2024 in a sale that would value Hulu at a minimum of $27.5bn. But as the five-year mark approaches, insiders fret that something else entirely could be in the cards after Iger said “everything is on the table”. That comment didn’t go down well internally at Hulu, according to employees. “It was an affront,” one executive said. “The takeaway was: He’s selling it.” Parting with the platform would help Disney focus on family-friendly brands such as Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars as it tries to lighten its $48bn debt load. But it would also mean sacrificing a formidable player in the streaming game to an up-and-coming rival like NBC’s Peacock. Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts has said he would be interested in acquiring the business, intensifying the fears inside Hulu that employees could soon have a new owner. Purchasing Hulu outright will nonetheless be a challenge for both companies, given sharply higher interest rates have curbed the investment plans of every major media company. “We have to get much more judicious in terms of not just how much we’re spending, but what we’re spending it on,” Iger said last week. “It’s just a tricky period of time.” The many sides of Guo Wengui Guo Wengui has been called many things, including “honest” and “forthright” by former UK prime minister Tony Blair. But regulators have a different description for the Chinese businessman, singer and conservative political darling: a serial fraudster.  The exiled Chinese businessman was arrested Wednesday on charges including fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. An ally of Steve Bannon, the former White House adviser to Donald Trump, Guo is accused of funding his lavish exile through a string of investment scams.  Prosecutors alleged he engaged in schemes to misappropriate more than $1bn from thousands of his online followers. The money allegedly went to everything from a “citizen journalism” media company, to an elite membership program called G-Clubs, and even a cryptocurrency project called the Himalaya Exchange.  William Je, a Hong Kong and British citizen whom US authorities said was Guo’s financial adviser, was also named as a defendant. Many of our readers will wonder who Guo is and that’s a good question. No one really knows: he is known by various names, including Miles Guo, Miles Kwok and Ho Wan Kwok.  But if you want some insight into Guo’s lavish lifestyle, we recommend you watch his music video for ‘HCoin to the Moon’.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Tough times for consultantsSBF faces more criminal chargesKKR’s new private equity bosses Pls fix: consultants go back to the drawing board Six months ago, McKinsey & Company, Bain and Boston Consulting Group were giving out large pay increases to keep up with the surging demand for advice on mergers and acquisitions and sustainability.  But as deals have dried up, so too have fees for consultants who were brought in to do things like capture “maximum value from corporate acquisitions with a battle-tested approach to integration that mitigates the many risks that can undercut a deal’s anticipated synergies” — to quote Bain’s website. Put simply, that often means job cuts. Now they’re having to practice what they preach. KPMG is cutting nearly 700 jobs in its US advisory business and about 200 in Australia, the FT’s Michael O’Dwyer reports — equal to 2 per cent of its total workforce in each country.  McKinsey, meanwhile, will let up to 2,000 of its 45,000 people go as part of a global restructuring, with back-office staff being particularly effected in an effort to cut costs, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The firm said it would continue to hire client-facing staff.  But some of the sector’s biggest clients — banks — have cut how much they spend on consultants as they also grapple with the slowdown in dealmaking and a gloomier outlook for the global economy. Credit Suisse, which is tight for cash all things considered, aimed to halve its spending on consultants last year, compared to 2021 when it spent SFr2bn on professional services. It has tapped advisers from McKinsey and Deloitte in recent years.  Fellow Swiss bank UBS has also reduced spending on consultants as part of its drive to cut $1bn in costs. As dark clouds continue to gather, the consulting biz must now do what it does best: restrategise. KPMG has been redeploying staff, including deal advisers, to other parts of the firm where there’s more work, people familiar with the matter told the FT. PwC’s UK arm had been increasing the number of employees it was seconding overseas, including in regions with more demand like the Middle East. Some consultants are even offering clients work for free from staff who have nothing else to do. It’s still too early to tell whether the sector can continue to uphold record partner payouts, which last year topped £1mn for the average UK partner at Deloitte and PwC. For those facing the exit, finding a new job could prove more difficult in the current market. The aggressive hiring practices at consultancy firms over the past two years have largely been driven by high staff turnover rates as employees left to work for new businesses. But as one Big Four executive pointed out: “No one is going off from here to create a hydrogen start-up now.” How SBF tweeted his way into more criminal charges White collar lawyers Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell have taken on infamous clients such as “El Chapo” and Ghislaine Maxwell.  Their crimes were notorious, but the drug kingpin and disgraced socialite generally operated with stealth — unlike the duo’s latest client, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried who appears to be a Twitter addict. US prosecutors on Thursday unveiled new criminal charges against the former crypto wunderkind, including securities fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, both of which were based on his prolific social media presence.  SBF posted “a series of false and misleading tweets”, the 39-page indictment alleges, after a hole in the cryptocurrency exchange’s balance sheet was revealed in November. Among the tweets that may not have aged well is: “FTX is fine. Assets are fine,” SBF tweeted in November after Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao publicly cast doubt on the financial health of FTX. (DD can no longer find the tweet on SBF’s profile.) Those tweets were just the beginning of a very public self-defence by SBF, from texting openly with reporters, expositions on Substack and even inviting the FT’s Joshua Oliver to his parents’ home. He has yet to address allegations in the updated indictment that he made large political donations “in the names of others in order to obscure the true source of the money and evade federal election law”, allowing him to “evade contribution limits on individual donations to candidates to whom he had already donated”. SBF made donations in the names of two other FTX executives, prosecutors allege, with one targeting each side of the aisle to “curry favour with candidates that could help pass legislation favourable to FTX” or his own personal agenda. Some of those donations were co-ordinated in an encrypted Signal group chat titled “Donation Processing”, the indictment added.  SBF has pleaded not guilty to the eight original charges against him in December. The latest charges will bring the total criminal counts against him to a dozen. Buyouts pioneer KKR promotes two top dealmakers KKR has promoted two veteran dealmakers, Pete Stavros and Nate Taylor, as global co-heads of its private equity business. They’re now the senior most dealmakers in a unit that pioneered the corporate buyout and has doubled assets in recent years. The role was created by KKR co-chief executives Scott Nuttall and Joseph Bae, who have sought to increase co-ordination across the New York-based group’s ever broader investment operations after they took over from co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts late last year.  KKR raised $81bn in fresh capital in 2022, including closing its latest Americas private equity fund, pushing firmwide assets above $500bn. Stavros and Taylor, who will be tasked with overseeing the group’s regional private equity teams in the US, Asia and Europe, have over the past decade made some of the biggest changes inside KKR’s private equity division.  Stavros has advocated sharing the firm’s equity on buyouts with the rank-and-file workers inside its portfolio companies. What started as a small project tested on pharmaceutical supplier Capsugel and garage door maker CHI Overhead Doors has grown to become a core part of KKR’s investment approach. Taylor, who was mentored by co-founder Roberts, revamped its consumer-focused investments after the disastrous buyout of Toys R Us. He led wildly successful deals for specialised consumer companies like National Vision and sporting goods store Academy Sports.  Stavros and Taylor will continue to co-head KKR’s Americas private equity businesses. The heads of its units in Europe, Philipp Freise and Mattia Caprioli, and in Asia Pacific, Ashish Shastry and Hiro Hirano, will report to the duo.  Separately, Johannes Huth, the head of KKR’s business in Europe, will step back from managerial duties and be named chair of the unit. Huth, a KKR partner and board member of German media conglomerate Axel Springer, will leave the day-to-day management to other KKR leaders.

"Beijing keeps the tech sector guessing","The inside story on the Asia tech trends that matter, from Nikkei Asia and the Financial Times","Hello everyone, this is Cissy from Hong Kong. Chinese new year is just days away, and I am very excited because we will have three public holidays here next week, which will allow me to spend more time with my cat and read more. I’m ready for a short vacation, and I think most Chinese technology companies were hoping for one, too — at least until Wednesday evening.  Over the past two weeks, these companies have received quite a few positive signals from regulators, and many news headlines have been hailing Beijing’s tech crackdown as “officially” over. Some of my friends who work at leading Chinese tech companies are not really convinced, though, and they are adopting a “wait and see” approach. As I was drafting this newsletter, state media announced that China will soon launch a state-owned ride-hailing platform in response to “disorderly expansion and data security problems” in the sector. The report was soon interpreted as a clear sign that Beijing is continuing to exert control over the booming tech sector, despite what some overconfident investors may want to believe. Even if Beijing has “officially” stopped cracking down on tech, the state’s increasing influence within the private sector is growing in other ways, as we have seen this week. Not so fast . .. As two of the most prominent targets of Beijing’s tech crackdown, Tencent and Alibaba have been among those most buoyed by hopes of an easing. Shares of both companies recently hit six-month highs. There are indeed a few things to celebrate for the duo, writes Nikkei Asia’s Cissy Zhou. Tencent has received long-awaited licenses for its imported video game titles, while Alibaba affiliate Ant Group got the green light for its consumer lending unit to raise more money. In a more high-profile move, the Chinese Communist party boss of Zhejiang province even visited Alibaba’s headquarters in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, pledging “unswerving” support to the ecommerce conglomerate that has been hit hard by Beijing’s tech crackdown. But sceptics say Beijing’s softer tone does not mean a return to an earlier era of a freer, faster-growing tech sector. Instead, the tech crackdown is now taking a back seat to reviving the economy, after China’s draconian, three-year-long zero-Covid strategy took a toll on economic growth.  Even UBS, which hailed the short-term easing, says Beijing’s grip over the tech sector will only tighten in the long run, as regulations will always try to catch up with innovation. The investment bank also expects more regulations to come for China’s short video platforms and the live streaming sector, as content is always a sensitive subject in China. A new kind of control The Chinese Communist party is swapping sanctions on tech giants for seats on their boards as a sagging economy forces a rethink in Beijing on how best to exert control over the country’s massive internet titans. China has moved to take “golden shares” in the local units of Alibaba and Tencent, and a slew of other internet groups, write the Financial Times’ Ryan McMorrow, Qianer Liu and Cheng Leng. The stakes, usually involving a 1 per cent holding and a board seat, provide the party a mechanism to remain deeply involved in their businesses, particularly the content they broadcast to millions of Chinese people. Ecommerce giant Alibaba brought an entity connected to China’s feared internet regulator into its shareholding structure earlier this month. People involved said the regulator took the stake to tighten control over its streaming video unit Youku and web browser UCWeb. The specifics of the government’s plan to take golden shares in Tencent remain under discussion, but will involve a stake in one of the group’s main China operating subsidiaries, separate sources told the FT.  Company documents for TikTok owner ByteDance show how the stakes work. After a fund tied to the internet regulator took a stake in its main Chinese unit in 2021, a party official joined the company board. He was given the right to appoint the group’s chief censor and chair a “content safety committee” within the ByteDance unit. Cloud competing  South-east Asia has been a battleground for Chinese tech giants for years, particularly in ecommerce, logistics and social media networks. Now, a new area of competition has emerged: cloud computing. Huawei Technologies and Alibaba are both rushing to build data centres in south-east Asia, aiming to capture shares of a cloud market that has grown red-hot amid a pandemic-induced shift towards digitalisation, write Nikkei’s Takashi Kawakami, Risa Kawaba, and Kosuke Inoue. Huawei, which has data centres in Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, has pledged to invest $300mn to develop cloud infrastructure in Indonesia over the next five years. Alibaba built its first data centre in Thailand last year and says it will spend $1bn to expand its data centres operations to a comparable scale as its core online retail business. The duo are looking to gain market share through lower prices, but they will have to contend with US rivals who arrived first. Amazon, Microsoft and Google together control approximately 70 per cent of the region’s cloud computing market. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and China could make it harder for Chinese players to attract customers. Cleaning up coal? Japan’s decade-long attempt to prove coal can be made “clean” is drawing to an end, but its accomplishments face a murky future as much of the world wants to phase out coal completely to avoid climate catastrophe, writes Nikkei Asia’s Sayumi Take. Situated on a small island in western Japan’s Hiroshima prefecture and backed by 49bn yen ($384mn) of public funding, a 118,000 sq m project aims to make burning coal less environmentally damaging. The project is scheduled to be completed in March. Japan, which sources about one-third of its power from coal, sees the project as key to its policy of safely achieving energy security as well as economic and environmental efficiency. In 2020, Japan committed to phasing out inefficient plants by around 2030, but did not join over 40 countries in signing a pledge in 2021 to exit coal power. Japan has hinted at wanting to export clean coal technologies to developing countries in Asia, which have young coal plants and are expected to face difficulty phasing them out. But questions remain, including whether clean coal power will be competitive against renewables and other, more conventional eco-friendly energy sources.

"Did US inflation ease in October?","Market Questions is the FT’s guide to the week ahead","Did US consumer price growth cool in October? Investors and economists are expecting the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate rises to eventually curtail inflation, but forecasts suggest it is not likely to be evident in data for October. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its US consumer price index report on Thursday, with economists surveyed by Bloomberg expecting a smaller acceleration in consumer prices for the month of October. Wall Street has forecast CPI to have increased 8 per cent year over year in October, down from 8.2 per cent in September. Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, is expected to have risen by 6.6 per cent year over year, the same rate as in September. The CPI data come after the Fed raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points on November 2, the central bank’s fourth consecutive jumbo increase.  “Whether it is this month, next month or the one after that, I have increasing confidence that inflation will decelerate,” said Eric Winograd, an economist at AllianceBernstein, citing lower commodity prices, an easing in supply chain pressures and decelerating house prices. Inflation may be a key factor in deciding the results of Tuesday’s US midterm elections to determine control of Congress, according to the latest polling data that highlight how the soaring cost of living and recession fears are weighing on the minds of Americans. Kate Duguid Will Chinese loan growth stabilise? The Chinese government hopes increased loan issuance will help fund infrastructure spending, restart stalled building projects and revitalise the world’s second-biggest economy, which has weakened owing to repeated Covid-19 lockdowns and a property sector slowdown. Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS, forecasts that renminbi loan issuance stabilised at around Rmb800bn ($111bn) in October, after far exceeding expectations the month before. The September surge — when new loans nearly doubled from the month before to Rmb2.47tn — was in part thanks to recent state support. That included an order from regulators for state banks to extend at least Rmb600bn in financing to developers before the end of the year and a reduction in benchmark lending rates. The People’s Bank of China also said it would lower interest rates on loans granted by a state fund to some first-time homebuyers at the end of the month.   But analysts said that economic uncertainty and the zero-Covid policy, which officials have vowed to uphold, could continue to hamper demand for credit in October. “Broad questions about a delayed property market recovery and unfavourable employment conditions still overhang China’s banking sector,” analysts at rating agency Fitch said, noting that issuance this year was driven largely by rising corporate loans to companies in manufacturing and infrastructure, while retail and corporate loan issuance has decelerated sharply. William Langley Did UK economic output dip in the third quarter? The UK economy is expected to have shrunk in September and in the third quarter, underscoring the Bank of England’s warnings that Britain is headed for a recession next year.  Economists polled by Bloomberg forecast UK GDP to have dropped 0.2 per cent between August and September, partially reflecting the national mourning period and the additional bank holiday for the Queen’s funeral.  It follows a contraction in the previous month when “there was a general loss of momentum in the economy”, according to Sandra Horsfield, economist at Investec. As a result, UK GDP is expected to have dropped 0.4 per cent in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, as activity suffered owing to high inflation and energy costs. This means a wider gap compared with the pre-pandemic levels of economic output than the 0.2 per cent shortfall registered in the second quarter.  In contrast, the eurozone economy expanded 0.2 per cent in the three months to September to 2.1 per cent above its fourth quarter 2019 level, laying bare the large hit of the pandemic and higher inflation on the British economy. As it raised interest rates to 3 per cent this week — the highest level since 2008 — the Bank of England forecast that the UK economy would enter a recession lasting at least through 2023. It attributed the long-lasting downturn to high energy prices and materially tighter financial conditions weighing on spending. Benjamin Nabarro, economist at Citigroup, also expects a two-year recession. “The UK is increasingly facing an outlook characterised by tightening monetary policy, restrictive rates and a large terms of trade shock,” he said.

"First Republic hit by succession crisis before Fed began raising rates","C-suite turmoil and shaky business model left US lender exposed to tighter monetary policy","First Republic was engulfed in a distracting internal succession crisis in the months before the US Federal Reserve imperilled its business model by embarking on an aggressive cycle of interest rate rises, according to people briefed on the matter.  After decades of rapid growth, when it won plaudits for providing personalised service to wealthy customers, First Republic found itself scrambling in early 2022.  Not only did founder Jim Herbert, 79, go on medical leave in December 2021 due to a heart condition, but Hafize Gaye Erkan, who had been groomed as his successor, left the company a month later. Erkan, a Turkish former Goldman Sachs banker with a PhD in risk management, served less than six months as co-chief executive and was involved in a series of interactions with other senior executives that two of the people described as “toxic”.  The C-suite drama would be followed by much bigger problems. The San Francisco-based bank’s share price has tumbled 90 per cent since March and depositors have pulled out tens of billions of dollars of cash, amid fears that First Republic will be the next lender to face a liquidity crisis after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  A search process to replace Erkan did not result in a strong external option, so the bank appointed chief financial officer Mike Roffler, who had been acting co-chief executive, to the role permanently in March 2022. Herbert became executive chair but his plan to stay on as an active presence turned off at least some outside candidates approached by First Republic, said people familiar with the bank’s process. Analysts cheered Roffler’s appointment. But behind the scenes, the management tumult had absorbed attention at First Republic in the months leading up to the Fed’s interest rate increase in March 2022, the first in more than three years. A string of aggressive rate rises throughout last year challenged First Republic’s business model of sucking up cheap deposits and offering very competitive rates on loans to wealthy customers.   “This is a tale of failed succession. Jim built an A-plus service-oriented bank for mid-level executives but then they flubbed it on the five-yard line,” said a person who has been familiar with First Republic’s management and strategy for years. “These guys were running a great bank but then the world changed on them.” First Republic declined to comment for this article. Erkan did not respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn.  ‘White glove’ customer service First Republic’s recent struggles amount to a swift comedown for the bank. Over 38 years, it had built a reputation for providing “white glove” customer service. It targeted people, often connected to the tech industry, who were very well off but not so rich that they qualified for top-end service at bigger banks such as Citigroup and Goldman.   In January this year, Herbert told shareholders that customer satisfaction with the bank was at an all-time high. But the more interest rates rose, the more vulnerable the business model became. It had relied on making home loans using cheap funding from customers who were offered lower mortgage rates in exchange for putting large deposits into accounts that paid little or no interest. Two-thirds of deposits were in accounts too large to be covered by US government-backed insurance that maxes out at $250,000.  As competitors wooed depositors with better rates, First Republic came under pressure to match them. Its interest expense shot up 10-fold, to $525mn in the last three months of 2022, from just under $50mn a year earlier, data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shows. At the same time, it had amassed $5bn of paper losses on bonds bought when rates were lower.  First Republic management was aware of the risks, and began warning of potential headwinds from rate increases more than a year ago. In ordinary times, these issues would have hit profits and probably made for a tough few quarters. But the March 10 collapse of SVB fundamentally changed how banks are viewed by investors and customers alike. First Republic’s reliance on uninsured deposits and the tech industry, as well as its paper losses, put it near the top of the list of lenders that resembled SVB.  The response has been brutal: about $70bn in deposits have been pulled from the bank and its market capitalisation has fallen from a high of almost $40bn in 2021 to about $2bn this week.  Erika Najarian, banking analyst at UBS, said the general feeling in the market was that First Republic was “a very important domino to stand up” in order to maintain confidence in the broader banking system.  From Ohio to California Herbert grew up in Coshocton, Ohio, where his father worked at Coshocton National Bank. He founded First Republic in San Francisco in 1985 with nine employees, $8mn in capital and a simple premise: “Deliver exceptional client service and growth will follow.”  In early 2007, Merrill Lynch, which was trying to break into wealth management and banking, paid $1.8bn to acquire First Republic. But Merrill unravelled during the 2008 financial crisis and was forcibly merged into Bank of America. As a large commercial bank, BofA had little need for First Republic, so it allowed Herbert to put together a 2010 management buyout with backing from General Atlantic.  After relisting the company, Herbert was soon turning heads. In 2014, the trade publication American Banker named him banker of the year, a plum usually reserved for heads of much larger lenders. By the end of 2022, First Republic had grown to 7,200 employees. According to longtime customer and angel investor Tim McCarthy, First Republic went out of its way to court wealthy clients with personal touches.  “It’s like the casinos in Macau and Vegas — you make money on the whales, so you focus on servicing them. The reason I’ll continue using them is because I know all their branch employees,” said McCarthy. Clients describe being assigned a specific contact, who makes an effort to get to know their preferences, such as the way they like to be addressed and the kinds of services they are likely to require.  “My wife does all of our banking and she loves them. Why would we ever leave?” said David Hou, a former First Republic wealth manager who kept his personal checking account with the bank when he left to start an independent advisory business in 2019.  Over the years, Herbert has been a reliable Republican donor to the party’s leadership committees, initially from California where he was writing five- and six-figure cheques to the party up until August 2020, and more recently from Wyoming, where he joined his daughter and grandchildren during the pandemic. The bank also employed the services of Richard Hohlt, a top Washington lobbyist, who has been advocating for less aggressive policing of the industry since before the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. First Republic’s spending peaked in 2018 when it shelled out $150,000 to lobby lawmakers as they were considering whether to water down parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms enacted after the financial crisis. After a 2018 law exempted banks of First Republic’s size from some of the most onerous requirements, the bank significantly reduced its federal lobbying spending.  Late last year, when the FDIC proposed reinstituting some but not all of the regulatory requirements for midsized banks, including holding additional capital in part to cover losses in bond portfolios, First Republic opposed the idea. In January, Roffler wrote a letter to the Fed and the FDIC arguing that such measures were not necessary because First Republic, and other banks like it, “do not pose the same, if any, financial stability risk” as the big lenders. Rising rates put pressure on income First Republic entered this year on a positive note. Deposits had risen more than 10 per cent to $176bn in 2022, even as some competitors saw outflows. Lending had more than doubled in the past two and a half years with few losses. Banks of similar size ended last year with a default rate of 1.5 per cent while First Republic’s default rate was just 0.08 per cent. But the bank was vulnerable. Herbert admitted on a January earnings call that rising interest rates were putting pressure on net interest income — the difference between what First Republic pays to depositors and what it earns from loans and other assets. Roffler warned that 2023 would be a “more challenging year”. While management had been dealing with an internal struggle that led it to pay Erkan $10mn in severance, First Republic had left itself very exposed to the Fed’s rapid rate increases. By early this year, the effects were starting to show. Both its mortgage book and its securities holdings had dropped in value, at least on paper. Nearly $100bn of its $166bn in loans were single-family mortgages with at least 15 years to run, most of which were written during the period of ultra-low rates. None of this mattered as long as First Republic did not have to sell them. But if deposits were to flee, forcing it to offload assets, the losses on the bonds alone would be enough to wipe out roughly a third of the bank’s overall $17bn of book value. First Republic had less room for error than most. By the end of last year, its cash on hand had shrunk from 8 per cent of total deposits at the end of 2021 to just over 2 per cent by the end of last year. The average for its peers was close to 10 per cent.  This meant that if the bank’s customers collectively asked for more than 2 per cent of their money back, First Republic would have to increase borrowing, sell securities or otherwise scurry to find the cash.  The day SVB failed, some customers lined up at one of First Republic’s California branches to pull out their money. Many more used online banking to transfer out some or all of their money instantly.  Banks in turmoilThe global banking system has been rocked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. Check out the latest analysis and comment here Last week, 11 of the largest US banks sought to restore confidence by depositing $30bn of their own money with First Republic in an effort to bolster its liquidity position. The move has slowed but not arrested the drop in its share price. First Republic this week added investment bank Lazard alongside JPMorgan Chase to help advise it on strategic options.  “They didn’t have a leader able to pivot when interest rates rose,” said one of the people who knows the bank well. “They did not see the tsunami coming.” Additional reporting by Courtney Weaver in Washington","24.03.2023"
"China intervention offers glimmer of hope to property sector","Government’s support package provides optimism that housing sales will rebound","Chen Jian, a 35-year-old in the city of Wuhan, is one of many victims of China’s property crisis. He bought an apartment in 2020, but the developer behind it collapsed, leaving him and his family unable to move into an unfinished home. Across China, an industry that contributes more than a quarter of economic growth has languished for more than a year, mired in construction delays after many developers ran out of cash. Now, a government support package unveiled over the weekend has provided a rare glimmer of optimism for those caught up in its woes. “I hope the new measures can work out a solution for us,” said Chen. “We are under great pressure.”  The 16 measures, signed off by the central bank and the main banking regulator, require banks to roll over their loans to the property sector, providing builders with more time to complete unfinished projects. They also offer fundraising and exit plans for unsold apartments. In addition, banks are encouraged to give homebuyers more time to repay their mortgages. In China, where apartments are often purchased before they are completed, the crisis has led to mortgage payment boycotts. Although it falls well short of a bailout, the government’s new package — in an environment where the economy has also struggled under zero-Covid restrictions — has had an immediate impact on sentiment. “I think this is a turning point for the market,” said Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Société Générale, who described the measures as a “housing rescue package”. “We should expect a rebound in housing sales and investment from here onwards, especially in the second half of next year.”  Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS, agreed. “Senior policymakers have taken a more decisive step in easing financing to the property sector,” she said. “The latest move reaffirms our view that property sales and starts should stabilise in the next few months.”  “We therefore see property being much less of a drag to GDP growth in 2023.”  China’s property crisis, which blew up last September when developer Evergrande defaulted on its international debts, has taken a severe toll on the economy. In October, Wang noted that property sales fell 23 per cent year on year, while land purchases by developers more than halved. GDP added 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, well short of a 5.5 per cent annual target that was already the lowest set by the authorities in decades. Still, the new measures are not a clear pivot from the government’s existing approach, according to Wang Qi, chief executive of fund manager MegaTrust Investments in Hong Kong. “China’s fix for the current situation is consistent from day one, starting with the Evergrande default,” he said. “The top priority is to get construction rolling and to deliver off-plan homes.” Richard Xu, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the notice from the People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was simply putting into formal terms what banks had already been told to do. The measures could help to buy time, he said, but were not necessarily intended to stimulate a major rebound. Lam at SocGen agreed this did not necessarily change the long-term outlook: “Even if we see a rebound in housing sales next year, a sustained recovery is not likely,” she said. “We still need to face the transition of the growth model to become one that’s less dependent on housing demand. We know that the policymakers just want to support structural demand, not speculative demand.”  Since a previous property crunch in 2015, authorities in China have emphasised that housing is for “living in” rather than for speculation. At last month’s Communist party congress, there was little mention of the challenges in the sector. Local governments, which have relied heavily on land sales to developers to finance their spending, remain under severe pressure. Consumer spending has also been hit. Retail sales turned negative year on year in October. Consumption in China is closely tied to the housing sector — both in terms of confidence and in the purchases of appliances and other items that come with a new home. Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING, noted that sales related to moving into a new home, namely consumer electronics, decorations and furniture, contracted 14.1, 8.7 and 6.6 per cent respectively last month. “I think household confidence will be restored eventually,” said SocGen’s Lam. However, uncertainty continues to weigh on potential buyers. One 30-year-old, who asked to be referred to only by the name Sun, said she had been thinking of buying a flat for the past two years but put off her purchase because she felt the market was getting worse. She saw the new measures as helping the development of new apartments, rather than impacting existing buildings. “The economy has not bottomed out, and I feel that the lowest point may be the second quarter of next year,” she said. “I’ll wait until then.” Additional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai","16.11.2022"
"Fed faces tough task deciding when to stop raising rates, official warns","Mary Daly says next phase of monetary policy will be difficult as pressure mounts for end to jumbo increases","The US central bank is entering a new phase of policy tightening that will be harder to navigate, a top official has warned, as pressure builds on the Federal Reserve to temper what has become one of its most aggressive campaigns to raise interest rates in decades. “This next phase of policymaking is much more difficult, because you have to be mindful of so many things,” Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco branch told the Financial Times. “You have to be mindful of the cumulative tightening that’s already in the system. You have to be mindful of the lags in monetary policy. You have to be mindful of the risks that are all throughout the global economy and the tremendous uncertainty that we have even about what the evolution of inflation is going to be.”  Daly is among a growing cohort of officials to back a slower pace of rate rises. This is partly due to the tightening already in train, but also because it takes months for the full effect of policy adjustments to be felt and even more time to show up in the economic data. Interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing are already teetering under the weight of higher borrowing costs, but broader price pressures remain elevated and the labour market tight. In less than a year, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points, relying on swingeing 0.75 percentage point increases to make up ground against inflation that has consistently surprised in its intensity. With the benchmark policy rate now hovering at a level considered to be “moderately restrictive” on economic activity — between 3.75 per cent and 4 per cent — Daly said the challenge the Fed now faces is determining what level of rates will be “sufficiently restrictive” to bring inflation back down to the central bank’s 2 per cent target.  “If I can do one thing for the public, I would say: stop thinking about pace and start thinking about level.” Jay Powell, the chair, said this month that the Fed could moderate the pace of tightening as soon as the next gathering in December, but stubbornly-high inflation likely means the level at which the fed funds rate tops out will be higher than previously expected. Daly said a “terminal” rate of “at least 5 [per cent] is probably likely”. Fed governor Chris Waller told a UBS conference in Australia on Monday morning that rates were going to “keep going up” and “stay high for a while until we see this inflation get down closer to our target”.   Asked if rates could hit 5 per cent, Waller replied: “It depends on what happens with inflation. If inflation does not come down or bounces back up, we may have to go higher . . . Right now inflation is determining where that number is going to end up.”  In her interview, Daly said the Fed was also focused on how long to keep the policy rate at a sufficiently restrictive level. “If I can hold it there [at an elevated level] for a year and really think that inflation is coming down, then that’s probably a reasonable rate to stop at,” the San Francisco chief said. “Overnight to 2 per cent is not my goal . . . but we can’t be so patient that inflation continues to erode the real purchasing power of Americans.” Moving too slowly to root out inflation also risks expectations of future inflation becoming unmoored to a degree that necessitates the Fed taking more stringent action, warned Daly, who maintains the Fed will be able to avoid job losses akin to a “severe recession”. Citing sweeping lay-offs at technology companies, which have included Meta, Stripe and Lyft, she argued that the “rebalancing” there appeared specific to the tech sector as opposed to a sign of something more broad-based. “They were very excited about the growth rates they saw in the pandemic and they hired as if those growth rates would go forever, and then those growth rates came back down to more traditional levels.” Beyond economic pain, another concern is financial distress that forces the Fed to intervene even as it ploughs ahead with its efforts to tackle inflation — something the Bank of England was recently forced to do after the UK’s government bond market seized up. The lesson there, according to Daly, is that drawing distinctions between monetary and financial stability tools “can be done, but it makes for some very challenging communications”.  Asked about the turmoil that has gripped cryptocurrencies, Daly said the central bank is paying attention to where “cross-contaminations” can emerge between companies and retail and institutional investors, but right now does not see a “big risk” to financial stability, with people continuing to reduce their exposure. “Each time that this happens, hopefully the impact on the general financial system and retail and wholesale investors will be smaller.”","13.11.2022"
"Bonds are (sort of) back ","After a tumultuous year, investors are daring to believe the asset class might be worth another shot ","Investors are at that point in their long, messy break-up with bonds where they’re tottering on a bar stool, tucking in to their third martini of the evening and asking their dearest friend whether it would be crazy to give the relationship another try? It has certainly not been a happy marriage this year. After four decades of stability, ballast in times of uncertainty and reliable returns (in nominal terms at least — no relationship is perfect), government bonds have done the dirty on fund managers in 2022. Soaring, sticky inflation dealt a blow, eating away at the fixed interest payments that bonds generally provide and lining up a series of startlingly aggressive rises of benchmark interest rates. This is bad enough: since the 2008 crisis, fund managers had become conditioned to expect vanishingly low levels of inflation and supportive central banks.  Sure, investors have whinged about bonds in the past, particularly when benchmark interest rates sank so low that yields turned negative, meaning fund managers ended up buying them in the certain knowledge that they would lose money if they held them to maturity.  But this year has been particularly cruel. Even super long-term government bonds have taken a hit. This is unusual in itself, especially with a potential recession around the corner, and weakness in this pocket of the markets has chewed up and spat out investment products labelled as supremely safe. These things are supposed to be boring and reliable. They’re not supposed to lose your life savings. It’s not just long-dated government debt that is to blame. The Bloomberg US Aggregate index comprising a range of dollar debt has dropped by about 13 per cent so far this year — comfortably its worst year in decades. And the real insult is that bonds have failed in one of their most basic tasks in a portfolio: they have fallen at the same time as stocks. Brief periods like this do happen, but not for this long. It has turned a bad year for investors into a terrible one. But after this historic rout, investors are slowly making their way back. Ten-year US Treasuries, to pick the global benchmark, yield 3.7 per cent. That’s not nothing, and it’s way above the 1.6 per cent we began 2022 with.  Could prices fall further? Sure, if inflation revs up again. “Inflation is incredibly hard to predict,” said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal & General Investment Management. “You have armies of PhDs looking at this at central banks and they get it wrong all the time.”  Still, yields are now decent, often without having to take any meaningful risk of default, and if the worst does happen (a recession, for example) the price will rocket, dulling the likely blow from sliding stocks. “One of the reasons to hold bonds is for the buffer,” says van den Heiligenberg. “That still stands.” Some, understandably, are hesitant. James Beaumont, head of multi asset portfolio management at Natixis Investment Management, says he has been underweight relative to benchmarks in US and European government bonds all year. Now he’s dipping back in, especially on the US side. “We are adding back towards neutral and it’s a more attractive investment proposition, but we’re not even neutral yet,” he says. “Can I see us doing that next year? Yes, but not yet.” Others are more excited. “Bonds are back,” enthused JPMorgan Asset Management in its latest long-term outlook. Pimco, one of the biggest bond funds in the world, is of course always predisposed to see the upside in this asset class. Still, chief investment officer Dan Ivascyn’s “call to action”, as he describes it, is striking. “Value has returned to the fixed income markets,” he said this week. “Just thinking about nominal yields, we’ll start here in the United States . . . you could look for very high quality spread product, and very, very easily put together a portfolio up in the 6, 6.5 per cent type yield range, without taking a lot of exposure to economically sensitive assets.” The now steady flow of outlook pieces from big banks and asset managers also suggest a rapprochement with debt is at hand. “In high grade bonds we see broad-based strength,” wrote the team at Morgan Stanley. Assets such as Treasuries and German Bunds but also a clutch of corporate and other bonds “all allow investors to ‘embrace income’,” it added. Goldman Sachs offers an understandably balanced message, given the huge range of potential outcomes next year. But it, too, says “there is more yield on offer — in both real and nominal returns than for a couple of decades. It may seem boring to structure portfolios around earning that yield, rather than reaching for the prospect of deep capital appreciation. But it may also be a return to more conventional investing.” UBS Wealth Management, meanwhile, advises clients to “seek income opportunities”. “In US investment grade, yields are around 5 per cent — a level we find appealing and which should provide a buffer against volatility,” it says.  All in all, it’s not exactly a dramatic rekindling of the romance. But investors are daring to believe the relationship with bonds might be worth another shot. katie.martin@ft.com","25.11.2022"
"The new gold boom: how long can it last?","Periods of inflation have often boosted the precious metal. This time it is also being bought by central banks worried about geopolitical risk","In a high-security vault in London’s Mayfair, where the glass is thick enough to resist automatic gunfire and four control rooms keep watch around the clock, some of the world’s wealthiest individuals have been rushing to store gold. The small safes inside, which cost as much as £12,000 annually, are set to be full by the end of the year as clients resort to securing more hard assets, a sign of the troubled times.  Clients have a growing “alertness to the new world order”, says Ashok Sewnarain, chief executive of IBV International Vaults, the Mauritian company that owns the vault. “We have mistrust in the banks, huge inflation and a global divide on reserve currencies.”  The rush to gold by the global elite is being mirrored by emerging market central banks. Last year central banks bought 1,079 tonnes of bullion — the most since records began in 1950.  As a result gold has been hovering close to its nominal all-time high of $2,072 per troy ounce — the traditional unit for precious metals — since late March. Many speculators, or gold bugs, are holding their breath as they wait for a new record to be set.    Gold has long been a safe haven in times of turbulence, and that is no less true today. Coronavirus, the war in Ukraine, geopolitical tensions, inflation fears, mounting global debt, high interest rates and the banking crisis have all prompted investors to re-evaluate safe-haven assets. Gold has been the beneficiary. “In the past decade, it was low inflation and high growth, globalisation and peace, laissez-faire economics and an invisible hand, and tech outperformance,” says Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS Pamp, a Swiss precious metals trading firm. “Each of these structural themes is unwinding concurrently, which is creating a positive environment for gold and other commodities.”  There is also a geopolitical factor, as developing countries grow wary of the strength of the US dollar. As the west imposed sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, the US and its allies froze $300bn of foreign exchange holdings denominated in dollars, euros and sterling. That alarmed many countries with US dollar holdings, whose central banks have been racing to diversify their holdings, and buy more gold.  “Gold has become progressively geopolitical,” says Sebastien de Montessus, chief executive of Endeavour Mining, a London-listed gold producer. Vladimir Putin, then prime minister, at the Russian central bank’s precious metals safe in 2011. When the global financial crisis struck, Putin touted Russia’s gold reserves as a ‘safety cushion’ © Alexsey Druginyn/RIA Novosti/Pool/Reuters The revival in gold’s fortunes has central bank officials, fund managers and retail investors wondering whether the world is on the precipice of a new gilded period. Some forecasters reckon gold could escalate towards its real record high of nearly $3,300 per troy ounce in today’s dollars, set in 1980 when oil-driven inflation and turmoil in the Middle East capped a nine-year bull run unleashed by US president Richard Nixon cutting off the dollar from bullion.  If today’s stagflation, geopolitical tensions and dedollarisation persist, then some say bullion will keep shining. “Is this a new era? Simply, yes,” says Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association, which sets the global standards and price benchmarks for gold trading. “The shift to gold is about creating a more neutral portfolio in response to geopolitics.” On the other hand, gold prices are notoriously fickle. As fear and panic ebb and flow, the price surge could prove to be temporary. And concerns over gold’s environmental impact — and the fact it has no role in the energy transition, unlike other metals — could also damp its prospects in the long term. Gold is having its moment, but how long will it last? The fear index A primary motivator for gold’s resurgence is concern about the reliability of other liquid assets. As markets have become more volatile in recent months, investors have been turning to gold anew. Since November, gold has gained a fifth to trade just below $2,000 per troy ounce after the collapse of three regional US banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.  “Gold is indicating that there’s a high degree of fear in financial markets,” says Ross Norman, chief executive of Metals Daily, a precious metals data provider. “It’s a bellwether and the bell is ringing.”  For some, this is validation of long-held beliefs on the security of the global economy. David Franks, a modern-day gold bug, holds more than £2mn in bars, coins and mining stocks but has otherwise steered clear of investing in the equity markets.  The UK-based restaurant owner says the scale at which governments printed money after the 2008 financial crisis to return economies to health made his investment choices a no-brainer. “At some stage, the world will wake up to America having debt way beyond its means. I don’t see any other answer than gold or silver,” he says. “If you have held it since 2008, it hasn’t done exceptionally well. I’m reassured one day, perhaps before I die, that it will do well.” His fears over a lack of other investable asset classes resonate beyond the bullion vaults that deal with customers prone to thinking in terms of crisis and catastrophe. Such concerns are accentuated as the US debt ceiling negotiations look set to go to the wire again this month. Gold in a private vault in Munich. Increasing concerns around currency reserves and banking instability have prompted wealthy individuals to rush to secure hard assets © Ulrich Baumgarten/Getty Images Janet Yellen, US Treasury secretary, has warned of financial and economic catastrophe if Congress does not agree to raise the federal debt limit by the start of June, which would raise the possibility of the first ever default on Treasury debt. Mark Bristow, who leads Barrick Gold, the world’s second-largest gold producer, agrees with Franks. The central banks of the world have run out of options, he argues, the inflation genie is out of the bottle and emerging nations face the risk of a US dollar debt spiral. “The harsh reality is when you have more debt than GDP, there’s only two ways to get out of it: have a major financial correction or grow your way out. We can’t grow out of this,” he says. “The only way out is a hard global landing.” Distrustful of dollars Beyond individual investors, the rise in gold has, in part, been driven by a global shift away from the almighty dollar. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, there has been a clear push to diversify reserve currencies: the US currency’s share of global foreign exchange reserves has slid from more than 70 per cent in 2000 to less than 60 per cent today. That tectonic shift has been led by Russia, China, Turkey and India. “A lot of countries have understood that the dollar was a weapon, serving the US,” says de Montessus of Endeavour Mining. For Russia, the west’s sanctions have only increased its reliance on gold, which it also mines domestically. When the global financial crisis struck in 2008, Vladimir Putin praised Russia’s gold and hard currency reserves as the “safety cushion” for the Kremlin to ease economic pain for millions of Russians. Three years later, the Russian leader toured the depository at the central bank in downtown Moscow, flexing a gold bar weighing more than 10kg. At that time, Russia’s central bank was in the early stages of quietly increasing the share of the precious metal in its international reserves. Today gold accounts for about 25 per cent of Russia’s $600bn in reserves — rising almost sixfold in tonnage terms since 2007. As countries search for alternatives to the dollar, a key question is what role gold will play in Beijing’s plans to internationalise the renminbi. In December, Xi Jinping touted settling payments for Saudi oil and gas in renminbi — which analysts say will only gain traction if it can be converted into gold. “Gold is re-entering the world system in terms of payments,” says Paul Wong, market strategist at Sprott Asset Management.  The People’s Bank of China has the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world at about $3.2tn and has reported adding gold for six months running — although many in the gold industry suspect the level of buying has been higher than officially reported figures.  This could help China challenge the US currency, says Oliver Ramsbottom, partner at McKinsey. “China’s sustained gold purchases could be interpreted as part of a long-term policy to loosen capital controls thereby increasing the renminbi’s challenge to the US dollar.”  Economies in distress, typically heavily indebted in US dollars, are also turning to gold. Before its default in December, Ghana, the world’s sixth-largest gold producer, proposed paying for oil imports in bullion — not dissimilar to the medieval barter trade of gold for salt between Mediterranean economies and west Africa. Another mining nation, Zimbabwe, is launching gold-backed digital tokens in an effort to prop up its inflation-stricken currency. After the gold rush While gold enjoys its moment to shine, it is hard to predict how long this rally will last. Precious metal price forecasters are sometimes compared with those who sit in the fold-down seat facing backwards in London taxis — they can only see what has come, not what is ahead.  That is, partly, because $12tn of gold sits above-ground with supply increasing at a 2 per cent rate last year, putting an outsized focus on demand push-and-pull factors that work in complex and unpredictable ways. Gold prices collapsed from a high of $1,920 per troy ounce in 2011 after the financial crisis to nearly $1,200 two years later.  In the near term, the key factor determining gold prices will be the path taken by the US Federal Reserve to balance keeping the economy healthy and getting inflation under control. That will be pivotal for whether asset managers join retail investors and central banks in piling in for bullion, after 10 months of outflows for gold-backed exchange traded funds until March.  Fed officials signalled last week they would not be deterred from further interest rate rises to tackle inflation after market expectations of a pause had been rising, causing gold to ease off to about $1,970 per troy ounce as higher rates raise bonds’ attraction relative to non-yielding bullion. Success in bringing down rising prices from April levels of 4.9 per cent to the Fed’s target of 2 per cent would further damp enthusiasm for gold, a hedge against inflation. An agreement on the US debt ceiling could also put downward pressure on bullion prices. Longer term, consumer appetite for the precious metal may be depressed by the state of the gold mining industry itself — especially as it comes under greater pressure to lower emissions, reduce environmental impact and become more transparent. “We are now firmly in a world that is decarbonising,” says Tom Palmer, chief executive of Newmont Corporation, the world’s largest gold miner that sealed a $19bn deal for Australian rival Newcrest this month.  He expects this will drive more mergers in the gold mining industry, as companies need longer-life mines to meet their climate targets and environmental goals. “We are in an industry that is consolidating.” Miners operate a drill in a shaft in Westonaria, South Africa. Recent research has highlighted the environmental damage of gold mining, leading to calls for the practice to be curtailed © Mike Hutchings/Reuters Gold, one of the least reactive elements, has little direct role in the energy transition, unlike many other more functional metals. But its deposits are often found alongside copper, which is crucial for low-carbon technologies such as wind turbines, electric cars and power transmission lines. Only 8 per cent of gold is used in applications such as technology, medicine and industry — the rest is mainly for jewellery and investing. That is not lost on gold mining industry executives, many of whom are trying to increase copper production. “If I were to get in the time machine and go forward 10 years, I think a lot of gold companies will be producing copper,” says Palmer. However, the shift towards a low-carbon world works against gold miners too: a growing cohort of researchers are calling for gold mining to be curtailed because of its environmental impact. You think of this clean, pure, luxurious substance. Nothing can be more at odds with the reality of how gold is produced A recent paper led by Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the Scott Polar Institute at the University of Cambridge, found that the carbon footprint of extracting gold was at least as much as all intra-European aviation, and says global demand can mostly be met by recycling. “When you think of gold, you think of this clean, pure, luxurious substance. Nothing can be more at odds with the reality of how gold is produced,” says Lezak, who points to impacts such as mercury emissions, water use and carbon emissions. “It’s easily replaceable and massively harmful.” Swissaid, an NGO, accused gold refineries of being reluctant to disclose which mines they sourced from because of human rights and environmental concerns in a report released in March. While many gold executives argue they improve the quality of life for local communities by providing jobs, and are reducing their environmental impacts, concerns over sustainability are set to grow in coming years.  This may not improve gold’s reputation among younger investors, who are likelier to be lured by digital investments such as NFTs or crypto. Although the industry-funded group World Gold Council is working on plans to set up a gold-backed stablecoin, Andreas Habluetzel, chief executive of Degussa Goldhandel, a European gold dealer that owns British bullion house Sharps Pixley, believes that the digitisation and generational challenges will limit gold’s ability to rally further. “In Europe, the younger generation are not really into gold. I don’t think we have a lot of chance for upside,” he says. Despite the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, he rues that “trust is back and crypto will have a future place as an asset class”. Crypto enthusiasts do at least have one thing in common with gold bugs: sympathy for the idea that the fiat currency system is broken, and headed for catastrophe. While risks remain present in the global economy, and as equities and bonds have shown signs of reversing their 20-year pattern of rising simultaneously, many will continue to put their faith in a weightier investment.  “It’s hard to push back against an asset with a 5,000-year history of providing wealth,” says Metals Daily’s Norman.","24.05.2023"
"Retreat of SNP’s old guard throws leadership race into uncertainty","Could this be another triumph for the party’s establishment? ","This article is an on-site version of our Inside Politics newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. The most important story in British politics at the moment is the turmoil in the global banking sector — chronicled in multiple FT scoops over the weekend, including the historic, government-brokered deal by UBS to buy Credit Suisse.  I don’t, in truth, have much to add here, other than that you should read our live blog and Due Diligence (premium subscribers can sign up to the newsletter here).  What I can talk about is the Scottish National party’s leadership election. Some thoughts on a recurrent question from readers, and an explosive weekend in the life of the SNP, in today’s note. Inside Politics is edited by Georgina Quach. Follow Stephen on Twitter @stephenkb and please send gossip, thoughts and feedback to insidepolitics@ft.com Ashes to ashes A lot of readers have asked me this question: why does so much of the coverage of the SNP leadership race take it as read that it is a contest between Humza Yousaf and Kate Forbes? What about Ash Regan, the third candidate in the race?  This is a really good question. Health secretary Yousaf is well-placed in the contest for reasons that have been well-rehearsed; he benefits from being the candidate of the party establishment, which has generally been well-supported by the SNP’s membership (more below on the latter). His ministerial record is nothing to write home about but we assume, given the SNP’s history, that most members will put that to one side and follow the lead of a majority of the party’s parliamentarians.  Then you have the MSP Regan, who has the most radical position on the question of Scottish independence, which, obviously, is of totemic importance to the party. Under her plans, if pro-independence parties win more than 50 per cent of the vote at the next Westminster or Holyrood election, the Scottish government should immediately begin negotiations to trigger independence. Most internal elections are, when you boil right down to it, a contest between the party establishment’s sober choice and a candidate offering a bolder approach. (Sometimes, of course, you can have both in one: Liz Truss was offering a more radical policy platform than Rishi Sunak, while also being the preferred choice of the outgoing prime minister, the bulk of the rightwing press and many of the party’s power brokers.)  Kate Forbes looks a lot like the sort of doomed candidate that party leadership elections throw up and spit out: one whose positions on a range of issues put her at odds with much of the party membership and make her essentially unelectable. A superficial glance would put her in the same category as Liz Kendall in the Labour leadership race of 2015 and Rory Stewart in the Conservative contest of 2019. Whatever you may think of them, both candidates had been too far from their party’s mainstream to win a leadership election. (Forbes’s interview with Lukanyo Mnyanda and Mure Dickie sounds an awful lot like the things Kendall and Stewart used to say, too: “never mind my heresies, look how popular I am with our party’s opponents.”) While we know comparatively little about the SNP membership compared with the UK’s other main parties, we do know it is drawn largely from the liberal left, and we would expect, therefore, it to be inhospitable territory for Forbes.  But the SNP is not a normal political party. Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, are basically 70 per cent propositions: essentially all of its MPs and activists support about 70 per cent of the party platform at a minimum. If you don’t, you are considered odd and aren’t likely to be able to remain an elected member of the party for long.   The SNP is, essentially, a 1 per cent proposition: the really, really, really important thing is that you support Scottish independence. This is why Forbes can say that she disagrees with the SNP’s position on social issues, thinks its record on public policy is somewhere between suboptimal and dire, and that the economic record is nothing to write home about, but no one really asks “so, uh, why did you remain as finance minister, then?” She stayed in her post despite the fact these are far bigger objections than any Rishi Sunak may have held against Boris Johnson’s government.  In a normal political party, we would say, realistically, this is a leadership election that can only be won by Yousaf or Regan. In a normal political party, we would see Kate Forbes as an incredibly eccentric politician.  Part of the success of the SNP over the past 20 years has been giving the group the appearance of a conventional political party: one located firmly in the social democratic centre-left.  What we don’t know, because there hasn’t been a contested election since 2004 — a contest in which a little over 6,000 people voted — is to what extent that movement towards the centre-left is just skin-deep. If the changes that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon made to the party have carried over to the membership, then yes, we should assume that this is a contest that is likely to be won by Yousaf and that Regan is the only candidate who has any chance of stopping him.  But we just don’t know if the SNP is still, under the surface, the same very unusual party that Salmond dragged from the fringes to the centre of Scottish political life. So it may be that we get a very unusual result on March 27. All just a case of history repeating? In October 2019, the SNP met for its annual conference, and the party’s elite were in all sorts of difficulties. Allies of the party’s former leader, Alex Salmond, were calling on the party to adopt a more radical approach to seeking independence. Under what its advocates called “Plan B”, a majority for pro-independence parties at the next election would be taken as a mandate to begin negotiations over independence.   In addition, one of the Salmondites, the Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny, was challenging Angus MacLeod, the incumbent national secretary, in what was the most open and acrimonious contest in the SNP’s recent history.  In the end, the party’s establishment triumphed on both fronts: defeating both the calls for a “Plan B” on independence and McEleny heavily in the national secretary contest. In many ways, the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the SNP has many similar features. You have Humza Yousaf, the candidate of the party establishment, against Ash Regan. Her proposed path to independence is essentially “Plan B” under another name, she is the preferred candidate of the party’s remaining Salmondites, and is, like McEleny was in his doomed race to be national secretary, raging against the party’s backroom operatives.  So in some ways we should expect this contest to end in the same way: with a thumping victory for the SNP’s establishment. When you add in the fact that at least 30,000 members have left the SNP, and that people who depart a political party tend to be ones who are least happy about its direction, all of this suggests that Humza Yousaf ought to be the favourite in this election.  But one reason to think it may be different is that Regan’s supporters are enjoying a degree of success far beyond anything that McEleny’s managed. Their biggest scalp thus far is Peter Murrell, Nicola Sturgeon’s husband since 2010 and the party’s chief executive since 1999. He has resigned after it emerged that the party’s membership was 30,000 members short of the 100,000 it had claimed at the start of the contest.  Murrell was the last of the big players in the party’s march from “also-rans” to Scotland’s dominant party in active politics. Sturgeon, of course, has stepped down. John Swinney, the deputy first minister and former leader, is due to follow her. Kevin Pringle, once the party’s communications director, is now in public affairs. Alex Salmond, who brought the band together, isn’t even a member of the SNP any more.  Maybe that means that the SNP’s internal critics are enjoying a period of brief success before the rank-and-file membership overwhelmingly endorse the preferred candidate of the party leadership. Or maybe it means that the SNP of 2023 is in a radically different place to the SNP of 2019, and that we are about to see a big upset in the SNP leadership race.  Either way, the really important thing about this leadership election is that it has seen the departure of essentially every major figure in the SNP’s electoral breakthrough and political success: and there is no guarantee that whoever comes next will be able to repeat those triumphs.  Now try this I felt very virtuous this Saturday, because I abandoned my usual routine of having a large breakfast and reading the FTWeekend.

"ECB and UniCredit clash over capital plans and Russia presence","Friction builds in wake of CEO Orcel’s aggressive strategy to overhaul Italian lender’s operations","The European Central Bank has clashed with UniCredit over the Italian lender’s plans to return cash to shareholders and its failure to leave Russia, according to people familiar with the matter. The friction has built since chief executive Andrea Orcel took over in April 2021 and implemented an aggressive strategy to overhaul UniCredit’s operations and pay out more funds to shareholders. The two sides have aired their opposing views in a series of letters, according to one person briefed on the matter, who said the relationship was “more than just a little bit strained”.   UniCredit said the ECB had “continuously provided us with challenge and guidance” during the bank’s strategic overhaul, adding that regulators’ “public support” was “indicative of the trust that they have shown in us”. The ECB declined to comment. The clash is also a sign of the central bank’s tougher stance towards eurozone lenders’ capital plans as officials brace for recession. Italy and Germany — UniCredit’s two biggest markets — are expected to be hit hardest by Europe’s energy crisis because of their previous heavy reliance on Russian gas. Several people briefed on the discussions said the ECB had objected to UniCredit’s commitment to distribute €16bn to shareholders by 2024, saying it ran contrary to official guidance that “banks should not set their dividend policies in terms of absolute amounts”. Another person familiar with the discussions said: “When the regulators send you a list of questions, you can come to a mutual compromise around the answers, but Orcel’s style is ‘I’m right because we’ve got all this capital’.” UniCredit has told the ECB that it has the headroom to pay more to shareholders without significantly weakening its balance sheet thanks to relatively high capital levels, with common equity at 15.4 per cent of risk-weighted assets.  There is also tension over UniCredit’s failure to cut ties with Russia. UniCredit is one of two European banks, along with Austria’s Raiffeisen, to maintain large operations in the country.  The ECB views the bank’s Russian presence as an unwelcome source of risk and has been pushing it to exit the country, where it has €2.4bn of capital tied up. Orcel has ruled out a fire sale to a local oligarch, as France’s Société Générale did this year, leading to a €3.1bn charge. Instead, UniCredit has held talks with potential buyers in China, India and Turkey. The ECB has been asking for regular progress reports. A person who discussed the issue with Orcel recently said the UniCredit boss was “getting a lot of pressure from the ECB” over Russia.  UniCredit told the Financial Times it was “committed to disengaging from Russia in an orderly and decisive fashion”. ECB officials were also disappointed by the lack of information they received from Orcel during his initial talks last year with the Italian government about a potential acquisition of local rival Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. UniCredit ended up pulling out of the deal. Orcel has been less proactive about keeping the ECB up to date with the bank’s decisions than his predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier, according to several people familiar with the matter. But UniCredit believes it has provided its supervisors with as much information as before Orcel took over, only via different channels.  The bank’s hard-charging CEO, who was awarded compensation worth tens of millions of euros from Santander after the Spanish bank withdrew an offer for him to become chief executive in 2018, has made higher capital return a key pillar of his strategy. UniCredit is on track to distribute €3.75bn via dividends and purchases of its own shares this year.  This contrasts with Mustier’s more cautious strategy, which focused on reducing bad loans, cutting costs and building up capital. The ECB told all eurozone banks to stop paying dividends or buying back shares to conserve capital when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020 and only lifted the restriction 18 months later. Share buybacks by eurozone banks must be approved by the ECB, which gave the green light for UniCredit to buy €2.6bn of its own shares this year in two separate tranches. In September, the ECB approved the second tranche but the process took longer and “was anything but straightforward”, said one person briefed on the matter.  UniCredit’s share price is up more than 45 per cent since the arrival of Orcel, a former UBS investment banking chief, outperforming most European rivals. The bank told the FT that it expected to make a record net profit of €4.8bn and generate more than €6bn of organic capital this year, adding “both are best in the peer group”. It has almost halved its non-performing exposures — long a source of concern for the ECB — from 5 per cent of its loan book in 2019 to 2.8 per cent this year.

"Fed should make clear that rising profit margins are spurring inflation","Companies have taken advantage of circumstances to lift prices","The writer is chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management In the world’s financial markets, US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell is increasingly cast in the role of playground bully — looming over the prostrate form of the global economy and chanting “hike, hike, hike” with malicious glee. US policy rates are rising relentlessly.  However, Powell’s public remarks offer little insight into how he expects higher rates to tame inflation. The omission matters as the current policy tightening will have an impact through an unusual route. That is because today’s price inflation is more a product of profits than wages.  Broad-based inflation is normally a labour-cost problem. The rule of thumb is that labour costs are around 70 per cent of the price of a developed economy’s consumer prices. If wage increases are not offset by greater efficiency or reductions in other costs, the consumer will pay a higher price for the labour they are consuming. With normal inflation, central banks would need to create spare capacity in labour markets to push wages lower. Wages have been rising but prices have been rising faster, so real wage growth is catastrophically negative. This is far removed from the 1970s-style wage price spiral; apart from the wage and price control debacle of Richard Nixon’s presidency, US real average earnings rose for much of the decade. The US restaurant and hotel sector helps explain why wage costs have played a limited role in today’s inflation. Since the end of 2019, the average earnings of a worker in this sector have risen just under 20 per cent. But the number of employees has fallen over 5 per cent. Paying fewer people more money means that the sector’s wage bill has risen roughly 13 per cent. The real output of the sector has risen 7 per cent. So US restaurants and hotels are paying fewer people more money to work harder. The rise in wage costs adjusted for productivity since the end of 2019 is somewhere between 5 and 6 per cent. Restaurant and hotel prices have risen 16 per cent. This is the current inflation story. Companies have passed higher costs on to customers. But they have also taken advantage of circumstances to expand profit margins. The broadening of inflation beyond commodity prices is more profit margin expansion than wage cost pressures. How is this happening? Two forces have combined. Despite negative real wages, consumers have carried on consuming. Strong post-pandemic household balance sheets have allowed lower savings and increased borrowing to offset the sorry state of real wages. The resulting resilience in demand has given companies the confidence to raise prices faster than costs. In addition, the power of storytelling has conditioned consumers to accept price rises. Imagine a story about a farmer who takes wheat to the windmill, where it is ground into flour, and then baked into bread. In that fantasy world, a rise in the cost of wheat of say 22 per cent might be used to justify a 15 per cent rise in the price of bread.  An economist might splutter incoherently over their morning toast, and point out that only 10 to 15 per cent of the price of bread is attributable to the cost of wheat — the cost of food in developed economies is not about food at all; it is labour costs. But the narrative might seem plausible to many a consumer.  And consumers seem to be buying stories that seem to justify price increases, but which really serve as cover for profit margin expansion. Indeed, the soundbite economics of the Twitter era helps this process along.  This unconventional inflation means higher unemployment and lower wages are not the only possible cure for it. Policy has more routes to lower inflation if the cause is about profits. Of course, higher unemployment and lower wages would weaken demand and squeeze profit margins.  But any softening of demand — for instance through slowing the leverage of household balance sheets — would also affect pricing power. The slowing demand for consumer durable goods this year turned the fastest ever inflation in prices for those products into the most dramatic deflation since data started being collected on them in the 1950s. So the prices that drove the early 2021 inflation story were transitory after all. By understanding that, the narrative used to justify today’s higher prices could also be attacked. Social media memes work both ways; a narrative of “rip-off Britain” and intense media focus in the UK in 2010 may have damped inflation at that time. Ending Fed chair Powell’s sphinx-like silence on what higher rates are supposed to achieve could help turn around the inflation story. ​Letter in response to this article: Inflation analysis fails to mention profiteering / From David Shanet, Clark Retired High School Economics Teacher, Huntington, Cambridgeshire, UK","02.11.2022"
"Unhedged’s Rob Armstrong on a puzzling US economy","Billionaire Koch’s donor network says it opposes Trump’s re-election","This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Unhedged’s Rob Armstrong on a puzzling US economy’ Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, February 6th, and this is your FT News Briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING]  A powerful conservative network says it won’t back Donald Trump. And European banks are getting a boost from rising interest rates. But first, we’ll chat with the FT’s Rob Armstrong about the puzzle that is the US economy right now.  Robert ArmstrongWell, I’m confused and I think everybody is.  Marc FilippinoI’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Financial markets start the week off with a bit of a head-scratcher. The question is, what is going on with the US economy? Is it cooling? Is it still going strong? Investors have been acting like it’s slowing and they’ve piled into stocks and bonds, thinking that the Federal Reserve will pause or even cut interest rates. Markets even surged after last week’s rate rise from the Fed. Then we got this report on Friday saying jobs growth is going strong. To puzzle over all this, I’m joined by the FT’s US financial commentator, Rob Armstrong. Hey, Rob.  Robert ArmstrongHi, how are you?   Marc FilippinoSo, Rob, this latest jobs report from January shows that the US actually added a half a million new jobs. And I got to tell you, this surprised everyone, especially because we’ve been hearing a lot about tech lay-offs, tens of thousands of jobs being lost in this sector alone. Now how do you square these mixed messages?  Robert ArmstrongYou’ve mentioned already two pieces of what is turning into a real economic puzzle. So we have all these bits of the economy that don’t seem to agree. So we have Big Tech saying they are seeing less demand from their customers. But for example, the credit card companies who reported earnings also last week, in the week before, all said they’re seeing no change in the spending habits of their customers. Just to look at other bits of the puzzle, housing is weak, retail sales are weak, the manufacturing sector looks soft. And then we have this great strong jobs report. It’s like, which pieces of data do you focus on? It’s a very tricky situation.  Marc FilippinoYeah, I mean, there’s been a real sense among a lot of investors that the economy is slowing and that the Federal Reserve is gonna stop raising interest rates or even cut rates at some point. So how are markets now taking this latest jobs data, which might incentivise the Fed to keep tightening monetary policy instead of loosening it?  Robert ArmstrongWell, I was surprised by how firm markets were. We’ve had an absolutely wild rally for about a month, especially in the highest risk stocks on Wall Street. Your kind of profitless tech kind of stocks. And, you know, risky names in general have rallied strongly. The market overall has rallied. And I expected when I saw this jobs report that it would really put the scare into everyone, but the market took it OK. The market, in fact, is another one of these signals that’s hard to fit into the puzzle. Again, not agreeing with a lot of the other pieces of data that we’re seeing.  Marc FilippinoSo, Rob, this is a lot to consider. What do you make of all this?  Robert ArmstrongWell, I’m confused and I think everybody is. So I don’t think we have the answer, but we have some parts of an answer. One, there’s clearly a big split between goods and services in the American economy right now. When we were all locked up during the pandemic, we all bought air fryers and exercise bikes. And now that we’re free again, we have too much of that stuff sitting around the house and we’re spending all our money on services, right? So it makes sense that the stuff part of the economy might be weak, whereas the activities side of the economy might be stronger. Another thing is that, look, the Fed has increased rates here. That is designed to hit the rate-sensitive parts of the economy. So when the Fed has gone from a policy rate of zero to a policy rate of four and three quarters, it makes sense that, for example, the housing part of the economy would be weak. And then finally, I think a lot of us, whatever the economy is doing, we might have a little bit of pandemic savings left over. And that is, whatever else might be going on in the economy, that might be buoying things a little bit and it might be a different picture when those pandemic savings run out.   Marc FilippinoRob Armstrong is the FT’s US financial commentator and writes our Unhedged newsletter. Thanks, Rob.  Robert ArmstrongThank you.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc FilippinoA major US conservative group has signalled it will not back Donald Trump in his next bid for president. Americans for Prosperity is a powerful financial donor network led by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch. And yesterday, its chief executive, Emily Seidel, said: “The best thing for the country would be a president who represents a new chapter.” She added the group would support a candidate “who can win”. This is the latest rift between wealthy conservative backers and the former president. Hedge fund executive Kenneth Griffin and Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman have also distanced themselves from Trump. [MUSIC PLAYING] European banks are in the middle of reporting fourth-quarter earnings. The ones out so far show that the last quarter was a profitable one. Switzerland’s UBS beat expectations. It also reported a boost from client defections from rival Credit Suisse. But we also saw record profits from Italy’s UniCredit and Spain’s Santander.  Owen WalkerIt looks like European banks are on to record their highest profit totals since before the financial crisis.  Marc FilippinoThat’s our European banking correspondent, Owen Walker.  Owen WalkerAnd really, the main reason for this is it’s a real sugar rush, really, of rising interest rates. And when that happens, that provides a real boost to banks, because a lot of the ones with retail arms, they, one of their principal areas of income is called net interest income, which is essentially the difference between what they receive from mortgages and corporate loans and consumer loans in interest and what they pay out, which is, tends to be significantly lower in savings accounts.  Marc FilippinoSo what are banks doing with these profits?  Owen WalkerWhat we have seen with some of the banks is that they’re taking these profits and offering quite large payouts to shareholders. So some banks have already had in place quite large buyout programs in place. Others are raising the dividend policies. They’re passing this on to shareholders and their share prices are bolting in response. And, you know, you look at some of these banks and they’re up sort of 40, 50 per cent, 60 per cent even in the last six months. So it doesn’t seem a bit of buoyancy around European banks at the minute.  Marc FilippinoThe big event this week is Credit Suisse earnings. This is the bank that’s been struggling with years of scandals and is trying to turn itself around. Analysts are looking for more details on client defections.  Owen WalkerThis is their own clients pulling money out in responding to some quite damaging social media rumours about the bank’s financial health. But what would be really interesting is to see whether those outflows continued and whether, you know, the bank itself has said that actually that they have put a stamp on some of those outflows. But there’ll be a lot of eyes on seeing how badly they’ve been affected.  Marc FilippinoThat’s the FT’s European banking correspondent, Owen Walker.

"A banking mega-deal looms over London","Plus, wealthy investors prove their loyalty to Adani Group and Darktrace’s past continues to haunt","One thing to start: A UK-based Perella Weinberg banker was found dead days after the investment bank put him on leave following a raid of its London office as part of an insider trading probe by German police and regulators. Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: A potential FAB/Standard Chartered revivalAdani ploughs ahead despite HindenburgDarktrace faces another setback Will First Abu Dhabi take another look at Standard Chartered? When DD joined the throngs of billionaires and bankers at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, one abandoned deal was still alive in people’s minds: First Abu Dhabi Bank’s pursuit of Standard Chartered.  The UK-headquartered lender’s chief executive Bill Winters and chair José Viñals were keen to dispel any rumours, stating that they hadn’t spoken to FAB since the news broke. “This is not something we’ve either engaged with, or been interested in,” Winters said. When news leaked in January of a potential takeover, FAB quickly said that it was no longer evaluating an offer. That kicked off a six-month period where the bank is restricted from acting again, unless another bidder emerges. But several people close to the lender say the deal could be revived after the cooling-off period ends in July, according to this new FT deep dive.  The United Arab Emirates, like its neighbour Saudi Arabia, is keen to flex its financial muscle in the west. The Saudi National Bank chair’s dismissal of its recent $1.5bn investment in Credit Suisse as “just another cheque” has set the tone for takeovers to come.  FAB is in an acquisitive mood. Early last year its CEO Hana Al Rostamani hired New York boutique investment bank Moelis & Co to identify transformational M&A targets, said several people involved in the process. StanChart topped the list. Moelis founder Ken Moelis helped pitch the rationale to government officials and technocrats who would have to sanction any offer.  The lender is chaired by Abu Dhabi’s royal renaissance man Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the country’s national security adviser and brother of the UAE’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (MBZ).  International Holding Company, another business chaired by Tahnoon that has charted extraordinary growth in recent years, has its fingers in the pies of everything from Elon Musk’s SpaceX to Rihanna’s lingerie line Savage X Fenty and Indian tycoon Gautam Adani’s sprawling industrial empire. DD has more on Adani later . . .  Even if FAB does revive its bid for StanChart, hurdles remain. Cross-border banking takeovers are very rare because of the cost, complexity and risk involved. Scores of regulators will need convincing, particularly in the US, which would need to sign off on its fifth-largest dollar-clearing bank to be regulated by the central bank of the UAE. FAB has a few options, two people involved told the FT: Approach existing large StanChart shareholders and ask them to retain substantial stakes in the expanded group, making the $30bn to $40bn cost easier to digest.Try a friendlier approach, which risks sparking a bidding war as the board would be required to seek rival offers. “Now the interest is public, it has opened Pandora’s box,” said a senior Middle Eastern banker at a rival. “If it isn’t FAB, it will be someone else.” Wealthy investors stick with Adani For most industrial tycoons, losing more than a quarter of their wealth in just a few days — or $36bn, in Gautam Adani’s case — might come as a lethal blow.  But the Indian billionaire, who has been knocked down quite a few pegs from the world’s fourth-richest person to the 11th since short seller Hindenburg Research made allegations of fraud against his business empire last week, is still standing. In a crucial test of how investors would react to the accusations, Adani managed to complete a $2.4bn equity sale as planned despite the untimely interruption. (The FT has put together a helpful explainer on Hindenburg’s report and Adani Group’s responses.) Gautam Adani, left, and Nate Anderson, founder of short seller Hindenburg Research © FT montage: Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post/Getty Images/Bloomberg Investors subscribed to more than 90 per cent of the offering, anchored by deep-pocketed backers including London-listed Jupiter Asset Management, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Goldman Sachs. A $400mn pledge to the sale by the aforementioned International Holding Company, which invested $2bn in three of Adani’s companies last year, kicked things off earlier this week, with wealthy Indian investors following closely behind. “This looks like high-net-worth people Adani reached out to for support for the [offering] came through,” said one Mumbai-based broker. Domestic retail traders and Indian mutual funds mostly avoided the deal. Adani, for his part, appeared to be preoccupied with business as usual. On Tuesday he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while closing his $1.2bn acquisition of Israel’s Haifa Port with local group Gadot, announced last year.

 Though Hindenburg’s investigation has certainly levelled a hit at Adani’s personal wealth, the short seller (or the “Madoff of Manhattan”, as the tycoon has somewhat confusingly dubbed it) has yet to carry the same cachet in India’s elite business circles as it does back home. That’s not to say others haven’t been swayed. Nicolai Tangen, the chief of Norway’s $1.3tn oil fund, told the FT the fund has reduced its positions in Adani’s companies. As of Monday, its holdings in Adani companies were about $200mn, compared with its weight in the fund’s index of about $800mn. Courting wealthy investors is crucial to Adani’s rapid, debt-fuelled expansion, which Hindenburg criticised as “extreme leverage”. Adani fiercely denies Hindenburg’s allegations. It says it is deleveraging, reducing group debt ratios even as total liabilities rise.  The showing of loyalty among Adani’s network of wealthy Indian investors suggests that the allegations pose greater consequences for the rise of the world’s fifth-largest economy — of which Adani has become the poster child — rather than the mogul himself. The dark traces left by Autonomy In September, US private equity firm Thoma Bravo pulled the plug on a bid for British cyber security group Darktrace. The move raised eyebrows, with some questioning whether the firm spotted something that investors hadn’t. Others pointed to the company’s historical ties to Mike Lynch, the British software entrepreneur who was charged with 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud. The charges against Lynch were linked to his company Autonomy’s $11.6bn sale to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. New York-based hedge fund Quintessential Capital Management, as it turns out, was among those watching. Quintessential published a report on Tuesday making claims about potential irregularities in Darktrace’s contracts with resellers and customers, predominantly dating from before Darktrace’s public listing in 2021. Mike Lynch, founder of Autonomy, has been charged with 14 criminal counts in the US. He stepped down as a director of Darktrace in 2018 © Bloomberg Darktrace’s shares fell 12 per cent when Quintessential first disclosed its short position on Monday and a further 5 per cent on Tuesday after its report was published. This isn’t the first short position waged against Darktrace. The UK hedge fund Shadowfall has claimed that the British firm overestimates its potential customer base and underspends on research and development compared with its peers. Darktrace, which said it has “full confidence” in its accounting practices and the “integrity of our independently audited financial statements”, must now convince investors and customers of the same if it hopes to remain one of the UK’s few tech successes.

"Small banks, big reach","Everything you wanted to know about US regional banks but were too afraid (bored) to ask","It’s been surreal to see global fallout from a depositor run on a US regional bank. It’s even stranger that the run occurred because depositors realised that bond prices go down when yields go up. (To summarise: after a poorly communicated capital raise, venture capitalists noticed that Silicon Valley Bank had large unrealised losses on agency mortgage-backed securities it owned; not because of defaults or credit risk, but because of duration bond maths. They then freaked out and told their companies to withdraw all their cash.)  But small and regional US banks have been under stress for a while now, even before the obvious unforced errors that characterised Silicon Valley Bank’s failure. That may be why investor fears have persisted despite regulator action.  The KBW Bank Index fell nearly 15 per cent last week, and a trade group of midsized banks is reportedly asking regulators for unlimited deposit insurance for two years. The stock of California-based First Republic Bank has sold off sharply; it is reportedly planning to place shares privately to shore up capital, after it was forced to meet cash needs with pricey loans from the Fed and deposits from larger banks. The broader issue is that even if the current banking stresses subside, the shock will still probably still force a large chunk of the US banking industry into retrenchment mode. As Jefferies noted on Friday: We expect the liquidity crisis will soon pass, but the events of the past two weeks suggest that a credit crisis will be upon us soon. This is not going to be the sort of Wall Street credit crisis that we have seen in the past, with waves of corporate defaults and IG downgrades. Instead, this looks more like a Main Street credit crisis where small businesses will soon find their access to credit restrained. The regional banks that have fueling the small business boom that has been ongoing since the pandemic will be far more limited in their ability and willingness to lend, irrespective of their deposit stability or access to liquidity from the Fed. The secret of NIM We won’t bore our readers with a full “What Is a Bank” explainer, but the core business of banking — using short-term financing for long-term lending — is measured by net interest income and margins, or NII and NIM.  And conventional wisdom says that Federal Reserve rate hikes are good for this business. This view seems to hold historically for the sector’s median NIM, according to a 2021 study from the FDIC, because the interest rates on a significant share of banks’ loans — consumer and business loans, etc — reset higher when the Fed tightens policy.  Banks’ NIM increased the most in 2022 since the FDIC started publishing Quarterly Banking Profiles.   But the benefits (or drawbacks) of higher interest rates also depend on the idiosyncrasies of individual banks, as half of Wall Street analysts have reminded us over the past two weeks.   For one, banks’ cost of deposits are very important. Interest rates on normal bank accounts are notoriously slow to rise when the Fed hikes, so higher-yielding short-term Treasuries and money-market funds have started to draw depositors away from bank accounts. That has happened across the financial system, as Barclays pointed out in a March 9 note.   Regional banks are experiencing more stress from this trend; analysts at JPMorgan argued in a March 10 note that large banks’ deposit losses actually reduce some need for regulatory capital and debt issuance.  And the largest banks haven’t extended credit as aggressively in recent years, leaving them with more reserves relative to assets and loans, as TS Lombard economist Steven Blitz pointed out in February:   The yields that banks earn on their assets is also crucial. This is why investors have been so focused on banks’ portfolios of safe bonds; many of those bonds were bought at fixed, low rates, and have experienced steep mark-to-market losses as the Fed raises rates.  The problem of unrealised losses isn’t limited to regional banks, either. For example, the mark-to-market value of Bank of America’s held-to-maturity bond portfolio declined 16 per cent in 2022. That’s the same size of the unrealised loss at Silicon Valley Bank, and less than First Republic’s 22-per-cent loss, according to JPMorgan.  That’s where recent government interventions come in.  From the government, here to help  Here’s the good news: the Fed is indeed helping banks avoid losses on the safest bonds in their portfolios, like Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities.   It has created a new facility where banks can pledge those bonds as collateral for loans, called the Bank Term Funding Program or BTFP. The BTFP lends against the bonds’ par value, while a normal Fed loan would only cover the bonds’ market value. So for the next year, at least, banks can respond to depositor runs their bonds without crystallising steep losses.  Now for the bad news: While that program is well-built to prevent the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, with its steep mark-to-market bond losses and flighty depositor base, it was created after Silicon Valley Bank failed.  The government’s response also doesn’t directly address other risks:  1) that depositors will keep moving cash out of bank checking accounts into higher-earning Treasuries and money-market funds, and 2) that depositors with money above the FDIC’s $250,000 insurance cap will panic and flee to larger banks because of the perception of safety. (Their deposit insurance aren’t any higher than smaller peers, so in theory corporate treasurers should want to spread out their cash widely across banks regardless of size. But in this case “Too Big To Fail” is a marketing slogan.)  In other words, the BTFP doesn’t solve the problems of funding and profitability that existed for regional banks before the run on Silicon Valley Bank. Those were caused by tightening monetary policy. Regional banks, national importance All of this matters because regional banks have done a larger share of US lending in recent decades. Regional-bank stresses therefore means the US economy will grow more slowly than previously thought, say economists at Goldman Sachs. They cut their Q4 GDP growth estimates by 0.3pp to 1.2 per cent last week. Dario Perkins, economist with TS Lombard, sent over this handy chart showing the shift towards lending by banks with less than $250bn in assets — that’s the current cut-off for regulators to deem a bank Category III or higher and regulate them more tightly.   Regional banks have an outsized presence in some more stressed corners of financial markets as well.  Banks with less than $250bn in assets make about 80 per cent of commercial real estate loans, according to economists at Goldman Sachs, along with 60 per cent of residential real estate loans and half of commercial & industrial loans.   Readers with a passing familiarity with commercial real estate, or just The New Hybrid Workspace, will recognise why that’s a cause for concern.  Barclays analysts already expected office-building valuations to decline by 30 per cent over the next few years, according to a late February note, along with 20-per-cent declines in multifamily housing and 10-per-cent in retail. That could put pressure on CRE loan books.  In a “severely adverse” scenario in the Fed’s latest round of stress tests, large regional banks had the most “overall downside potential” from commercial real estate, Barclays found:   So given the importance of regional banks, how should we get a sense of how much stress they’re under? Economists from Goldman Sachs have a few ideas for data points to track.  The first is bank deposit rates, to determine whether banks are paying up to keep depositor funding. Daily money-market fund flows should also provide a sense of whether people are moving money out of banks and into higher-yielding alternatives. And finally, daily bond issuance by Federal Home Loan Banks can be a helpful gauge of how much banks are relying on government funding.   For tracking the outlook for individual banks’ deposits, CreditSights suggests following an unusual leading indicator: rating agencies’ actions. The firm’s logic is that rating agencies have privileged access to non-public bank information, and could be prompted to downgrade ratings if they see deposit outflows. (CreditSights was purchased in 2021 by Fitch Group, which owns Fitch Ratings.)  Our theory is that anyone and everyone that can get color from inside a bank has been trying to do so to gauge deposit flight risk; the key difference is that with the rating agencies, there’s a public response to that material non-public information in the form of ratings actions that we think have a lot of signaling value for assessing individual bank liquidity stress. “The Battle Hymn of First Republic”*  This brings us to First Republic, which has been downgraded to junk by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Ratings, with S&P downgrading the bank again on Sunday.  It’s in a vulnerable spot relative to other surviving regional banks for a few reasons. First, it has a wealthy depositor base, and while it doesn’t have the same share of uninsured commercial deposits as Silicon Valley Bank, those deposits may nonetheless be “hot”, according to CreditSights. The analysts guess that First Republic’s wealthy client base may be more reliant on financial advisers for advice, so warnings from a handful of advisers may have sparked a run.  What’s more, the make-up of First Republic’s balance sheet makes it unusually difficult for the bank to benefit from the Fed’s new BTFP program.  First Republic’s $28bn portfolio of held-to-maturity securities was 62-per-cent invested in municipal bonds at the end of last year, according to its latest 10-K. Long-dated munis don’t seem to be eligible for the Fed’s new BTFP program, but are eligible to be pledged at the discount window, which saw record use last week.  Its sizeable book of single-family residential mortgages, which totalled $99bn at the end of last year, appears to be eligible for the discount window as well, but those mortgages (which aren’t agency MBS) aren’t eligible for the better BTFP terms either.  While First Republic is especially vulnerable right now, rating agencies have also highlighted a few other banks that face downgrade risk. Last week Moody’s put its ratings on Western Alliance, Comerica, Zions Bancorp and UMB under review for downgrade, while Fitch has put PacWest Bancorp on watch.  For now, in the absence of real-time information on deposits, investors and long-suffering finance bloggers will need to rely on credit ratings and stock prices.  Readers can stay tuned for a roster of regional banks whose shares have sold off most — and for a closer look at different types of deposits. In the meantime we’ll be continuing to follow on the Credit Suisse/UBS deal.  *We stole this subtitle from CreditSights, and are kicking ourselves for not thinking of it first. ","20.03.2023"
"Asian battery makers jeopardise raw materials access by delaying deals","South Korean groups holding back on direct investments in Australian producers in danger of ‘being left behind’","Some of Asia’s biggest battery makers are jeopardising their access to sufficient raw materials by holding back on direct investments in producers in Australia that supply them. Industry insiders told the Financial Times that more deals need to be signed in order for South Korean companies — including LG Energy Solution, SK On and Samsung SDI — to secure supplies of minerals to make electric-vehicle batteries, including graphite, lithium, nickel and cobalt.  “We are not seeing anywhere near enough deals being completed,” said Ross Gregory, executive director of electric vehicle consultancy New Electric Partners and chair of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Korea. “It’s inevitable that the Korean cell makers need to invest more to secure supply.”  According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, at least 384 new mines for critical minerals will be required to meet global battery demand by 2035, with demand for lithium-ion batteries projected to grow six-fold by 2032. South Korea produces a quarter of the world’s EV batteries and is an important partner for Washington, as the Biden administration works to reduce its dependence on China. But despite the US rolling out new tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act to boost domestic production and encourage producers like South Korea to work with free trade partners such as Australia, the necessary dealmaking between the latter two countries is not accelerating.  Tim Bush, a Seoul-based EV battery analyst for UBS, said Korean battery makers were being cautious because of lingering uncertainty over how the act will be implemented. He noted the US government had not yet spelt out precisely what degree of Chinese involvement in an individual battery’s supply chain would disqualify it from receiving valuable tax credits. “The Korean battery firms are waiting to see what’s allowed and what’s not allowed before pulling the trigger on major investments,” said Bush. “For example, if Chinese processors are not going to be allowed to be involved even in projects outside China, the Koreans will have to rethink their strategy.”  Most critical minerals mines in Australia are still operated by small companies seeking joint ventures or direct equity investments in individual projects. However, Korean battery makers have been hesitant to sign deals that they perceive as risky. “We are currently evaluating such investment requests but we are trying to be careful. These requests often delay the signing of our long-term supply contracts with them,” said a Korean battery executive.  Korean export credit agencies bear the scars of failed mining ventures in the past. “Our state-run credit agencies often provide funding for developing overseas mines, but these projects are very risky as mineral prices are volatile,” said a Korean energy ministry official. “The battery companies invest in some mining projects if needed, but they remain reluctant to invest much given the growing need to build their own battery and battery materials plants,” the official added. An Australian banker who specialises in mining deals said Korean companies and lenders were being too cautious. “There is a frustration around Korean involvement in Australian mineral projects because of a clash with the wheeler-dealer culture of Australian exploration,” said the banker. “There is a real danger of Korea being left behind.” There are some deals going ahead. Last month, SK On acquired a 10 per cent stake in Australia’s Lake Resources, a long-established lithium developer, as part of a 10-year lithium supply deal.  Gregory, who advised Lake Resources on its deal with SK On, said part of the Korean battery makers’ hesitancy was because they had backgrounds in the chemicals sector rather than in mining.   He noted that Posco, the Korean steelmaker, had been much more active in making investments in the battery supply chain than LG, SK or Samsung due to its history of investing in iron ore and other projects.  Posco and LGES were both backers of Queensland Pacific Metals, which is developing a nickel and cobalt processing plant in Townsville. Last month, Queensland signed a major investment deal with General Motors, a sign that US carmakers are ramping up their interest in the Australian minerals supply chain. Gregory urged the Australian government to step in and finance more deals, including by taking direct stakes in projects.  “What’s missing is the government support — China does it, the US is starting to do it but Australia doesn’t yet do enough,” said Gregory. “A$20bn-A$30bn should go into sponsoring not only the exploitation of upstream resources but also the establishment of a manufacturing industry to process those materials. The industry needs a leg up.” But given the global scramble to secure resources, some executives believe it is only a matter of time before Korean battery companies become more aggressive.  Andrew Penkethman, chief executive of Ardea Resources, whose Kalgoorlie Nickel Project hosts the largest nickel-cobalt resource in Australia, said he could afford to wait for the right deal. “We’ve seen a marked increase in engagement from potential strategic partners since the Inflation Reduction Act, but people are still working out how to go about it,” he said. He said he expected Korea’s battery makers to come around to the idea that direct investments in projects would be necessary in order to secure long-term supply. “We will see an acceleration in deals being completed in the lithium-ion battery sector and our patience will be rewarded.”","05.11.2022"
"Portfolio-shielding active ETFs struggle to gain ground","More than two years since they received regulatory approval, almost half of their $4.4bn in AUM are in just one vehicle","Latest news on ETFsVisit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools Non-transparent ETFs have struggled to gain traction among investors in the two years since the first products launched, data show. Portfolio-shielding ETFs had $4.4bn in assets as of September 30, according to Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar, representing about 1.5 per cent of the active ETF market. But nearly half of those assets are in one ETF, the $2.1bn Nuveen Growth Opportunities ETF, Morningstar data show.  “It’s not evident from flows that a strong wave of demand has materialized for the offerings,” said Daniil Shapiro, director of product development at Cerulli Associates. “It’s possible that longer track records and approval on platforms will help the products along.” This article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group. Non-transparent ETFs received regulatory approval in December 2019 after garnering interest from firms including BlackRock, Capital Group, Nuveen, Columbia Threadneedle and American Century. American Century launched the first active non-transparent ETFs on March 31 2020. One, the American Century Focused Large Cap Value ETF, now has $200mn, and the other, the American Century Focused Dynamic Growth ETF, has $121mn, according to American Century’s website. Investors piled a combined $197mn into the pair of ETFs between April and June 2020, according to data from Morningstar Direct, but that interest quickly waned. From July 2020 to September 2022, they added just $100mn in net inflows. Investors pulled $50mn from the funds during the year ended September 30. Non-transparent ETFs have lost market share among active ETFs so far this year, Armour said. Active ETFs have organically grown 19.8 per cent year to date through September, or 11.7 percentage points faster than non-transparent ETFs, he added. Part of the reason why non-transparent ETFs have struggled to gather assets is that major broker-dealers have been slow to add the products to their platforms. This year, UBS, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said they would start offering a small number of portfolio-shielding ETFs on their platforms.  “Investors don’t appear to have the same desire for opaque strategies as some fund managers,” he said. Overall, investor reception to non-transparent ETFs has been “lukewarm at best” and “downright cold” at worst, said Nate Geraci, president at The ETF Store. “Fund flows continue to show that investors value the simplicity and transparency of the traditional ETF wrapper,” Geraci said. “Fund companies must demonstrate that there are real, tangible benefits to investors by adding the complexity and opacity that the non-transparent structure brings. Thus far, they haven’t been able to do that.” A more complex wrapper will not “magically transform” underperforming active managers into “alpha generators”, Geraci said. Traditional shops “who were extremely late arriving to the ETF party” likely sought to “straddle the line” and offer a hybrid between a mutual fund and ETF wrapper. The problem with this approach, Geraci noted, is that investors had already embraced the transparent ETF wrapper. “You simply can’t give investors a feature like daily transparency and then try to take it back — the horse is already out of the barn,” Geraci said. “I think the non-transparent ETF wrapper is basically dead in the water.”  Non-transparent ETFs came about, in part, because of concerns from shops that rivals would mimic active transparent ETFs, analysts said. “The risk is that of front-running and harming trade execution,” Shapiro said. “It is still perceived as a challenge today both for equity and fixed-income strategies.” In contrast, that challenge could also be viewed as “less of a concern today” due to the proliferation of transparent actively managed ETFs and managers’ ability to use custom creation and redemption baskets, Armour said. Active ETFs had $304.9bn in assets as of September 30, according to Morningstar Direct, or 174 per cent more than they did the month that the first portfolio-shielding ETFs debuted. And transparent active ETF managers have not had their secret sauce copied, Armour said. Also, over the past two years, managers who historically ran mutual funds, which are less transparent than ETFs, have entered the ETF space for the first time, with fully transparent strategies. “I would say that some PMs think [copycats] are a problem and thus don’t want their strategies public,” said Dave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi. “Honestly, I feel pretty strongly that if your strategy requires nobody knowing what you’re doing, it implies that you are having an influence on your chosen investments simply by participating — which also often means there’s not a ton of liquidity.” Not every strategy belongs in a “highly liquid arbitrage vehicle” such as an ETF, Nadig said. “Some funds need to be able to close to new money,” he added. “The ANT structure solves a portfolio manager problem, not an investor problem and, as such, I expect its use cases will remain pretty narrow,” Nadig said. “Investors like transparency, so where issuers can provide it, they will.” *Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

"The UAE business that went from obscurity to a $240bn valuation in 3 years","In 2019, International Holding Company was a little-known company involved in fish farms, food and real estate","Three years ago, International Holding Company was a little known company that ran fish farms and food and real estate businesses. It employed just 40 people. Today, the Abu Dhabi-listed group’s market capitalisation of $240bn is more than double that of global giants Siemens and GE and it has a headcount of 150,000.  It is an extraordinary transformation that has largely gone unnoticed outside the United Arab Emirates, and is little understood — even by bankers based in the region. “Nobody knows,” said one Gulf-based international banker when asked to explain IHC’s dramatic growth. It is a common response to questions about the conglomerate, despite it accounting for a third of the FADX 15, the benchmark index of the ADX Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. As its share price has soared 42,000 per cent since 2019, it has become the second largest listed company in the Middle East after Saudi Aramco, the state oil company.   Even Syed Basar Shueb, who took over as IHC’s chief executive in mid-2019, acknowledged that “it’s amazing”.  In an interview with the Financial Times, he insisted there are simple explanations for the company’s growth — the transfer of more than 40 companies, which combined are worth $4.7bn according to IHC, from Royal Group, another Abu Dhabi conglomerate. The majority of the businesses were transferred at nominal value of one dirham each, Shueb said.  Yet that explains only part of the story: IHC’s total assets have swelled from $215mn at the end of 2018 to $54bn in the third quarter of 2022.   According to IHC, this is down to the growth of the businesses it now controls. “We don’t give any dividend, the profits we made in 2020, 2021 is mainly . . . invested back,” Shueb said. “We are trying to create a giant here . . . a global giant.”  Others, however, view IHC as an example of the increasingly blurred relationship between business and power in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital and wealthiest member of the federation. It has also sparked questions about transparency. “It’s probably the biggest threat to the ADX because we don’t know what’s happening,” said the banker. “There’s a lot of great things happening on the ADX, and then there’s this thing that nobody knows.”  Such is the concern about the spectacular growth of IHC’s market capitalisation that officials in neighbouring Dubai no longer consider the possibility of reviving discussions on a future merger of its stock market with the ADX, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The International Holding Company headquarters in Abu Dhabi  Ernst & Young said its review of IHC’s latest financial statement, for the third quarter of last year, was “substantially less in scope” than an audit along international standards and therefore E&Y was unable to obtain assurance “of all significant matters”. IHC said: “Due to the limited amount of information that is required to be presented in an interim financial statement . . . external auditors typically do not conduct a full-fledged audit of these financial statements.” The company’s transformation can be timed to the period Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, one of the most powerful figures in Abu Dhabi, took over as chair in 2020. As well as being the UAE’s national security adviser, he is the full brother of its president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, and he oversees an expanding business empire. In addition to his role at IHC, he chairs ADQ, a new and increasingly active state investment vehicle, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the UAE’s largest lender, and Group42, an Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing company.  He also controls Royal Group, a holding company that owns 62 per cent of IHC. About 24 per cent of IHC’s shares are freely floated, with more than 90 per cent of investors from the Gulf.   Shueb said Sheikh Tahnoon’s vision for IHC “was limited to creating value for the shareholders”. “How we create [value] is cascaded to the management,” he said.  He dismissed scepticism about what had driven the rapid share price growth, saying it was a “little bit of ignorance of the bankers who are not looking at it properly”. “The investor who is willing to invest at this market cap, it is only because they have done their homework well because they can see those assets have a significant value,” he said. “I believe people are anticipating that those certain assets that are still outside [with Royal Group] will come to the IHC group . . . which I’m not denying, it’s likely they will come.”  Shueb sought to explain the group’s goal as “one simple thing — [to] create value for our shareholders by investing in different portfolios, not one stream of investment”.  “We do the acquisition, we do the synergy, immediately next we go for diversification,” he said. As an example, he said if IHC bought a telecoms company it would integrate it on the services side of IHC, and expand into “solutions” and “hardware sales”. In agriculture, the plan was to supply food from “farm to table”.  He added that the company has a $10bn war chest for investments and is targeting group revenue growth from $7.7bn in 2021 to $27bn in 2023, largely through acquisitions. “Our five-year plan is to reach 1tn dirham [$272bn] in revenue at least, in acquisitions, and our own businesses are doing very well,” Shueb said.  Deals by IHC in 2022 include investing $2bn in three Mumbai-listed companies that are part of the empire of Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, $500mn to buy a 50 per cent stake in a Turkish clean energy company, and a $2bn offer to buy up to 31.25 per cent of Colombian food group Grupo Nutresa.  Shueb attributed IHC profits of $6.5bn in the first nine months of 2022, a 236 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2021, largely to investments, including its stake in the Adani companies.  Shueb said IHC’s focus was on tech, healthcare, real estate, construction, food and agribusiness and general investment. Geographically, its attention was on Asia and Latin America and it is looking for deals in markets as diverse as Turkey and Indonesia.  “These are progressing economies; they have population; they have reasonable systems to support all this growth and at the end of the day, because we are from Abu Dhabi and UAE population is only 10mn, I cannot . . . reach 100mn population but I can reach 100mn through these companies,” he said.  He added that IHC was also “looking at certain deals” in the US, where it already has some holdings, including a stake in Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, he viewed Europe as “a very uncertain market right now”. “We are getting a lot of very good deals [in Europe], but [we] don’t know if these good deals will stay good,” he added.  Asked why there was no independent research on the group despite its size and dominance of the ADX, Shueb said “it’s up to them if they want to do it or not”.  “When I go to the market for any IPO for my companies, I get enough questions from the local investor base . . . they have enough research on our financials,” he said. “Our books are very open.” IHC has had discussions with a credit agency about a rating, but that process hit a stumbling block when the agency asked what to compare the group with, Shueb said.  “The team are still working [on the rating and] most likely will find a solution,” he added. He said IHC had debt of about 10bn dirham, excluding operating debt at portfolio companies, and would look to increase its borrowing as it expanded. The group had begun developing relations with international banks, he added, including securing a loan of “several billion dollars” from Standard Chartered and was engaging with Goldman Sachs and UBS.  Others still need convincing of the group’s strategy.  “I don’t understand it because it’s a $200bn market cap company that files less disclosure than entities significantly smaller than that, and the whole complex of listed and unlisted subsidies that are highly active,” said another Gulf-based banker.  However, “it’s such an important source of deal flow that I’m sure some banks are examining what they can do,” to get involved, he added. ","08.01.2023"
"The ECB’s inflation dilemma: can Lagarde silence her critics again?","Europe’s self-styled problem solver has won over naysayers for her deft handling of serial crises. But this latest economic fire is proving hard to quash","Christine Lagarde’s husband has asked her to stop changing jobs, the European Central Bank president likes to joke, because each time she begins a new role a major crisis seems to follow. Soon after becoming French finance minister in 2007, she found herself handling the global financial crisis for which she eventually won plaudits.  After being appointed head of the IMF in 2011, the eurozone debt crisis escalated. Despite early criticism for siding with German-led austerity policies, she was admired for her calm diplomatic skills and played a key role in finding consensus on the 2012 Greek bailout that saved the euro.  In the three-and-a-half years since she took charge at the ECB, the European economy has been hit by a series of calamities, including the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But views are mixed on whether she is doing a good job of responding. The Financial Times has spoken to a dozen current and former members of the ECB’s rate-setting governing council in the past few weeks as well as several economists, financiers and analysts who follow the central bank closely. Most of them praise Lagarde for rebuilding unity among ECB monetary policymakers and preventing recent economic shocks from spiralling into a financial crisis. But critics complain she lacks economic expertise, was late to react to soaring inflation and should communicate more clearly.  The US Federal Reserve and Bank of England have also been blamed for letting inflation surge far above their 2 per cent targets to the highest levels since a price spiral caused by the 1970s oil shocks. But the ECB was slower than the Fed or BoE to start raising rates or to withdraw the massive monetary stimulus it deployed for much of the past decade, leaving it more open to attack. “For an independent institution, achieving its target is a large part of its accountability, so inevitably big misses are an issue even under exceptional circumstances,” says Spyros Andreopoulos, an economist at French bank BNP Paribas who worked for the ECB until 2018. “The jury is still out — the ultimate judgment may depend on whether the ECB will have to engineer a recession to bring inflation down.” But in a sense, Lagarde is on familiar territory. Ever since she gave up a successful career running US law firm Baker McKenzie to become a government minister in her native France in 2005, she has faced early brickbats before being thrust into centre stage to help defuse a global crisis. Some analysts believe there is sexism behind the carping, especially from investors. “Financial market participants are mostly men,” says one. “That partly explains it.”  The question now is whether Europe’s self-styled problem solver is confronted with a fire that is impossible to extinguish swiftly. “I don’t think it was me who caused the crises,” she joked during a recent discussion with students of the elite École Polytechnique in Paris, remembering how rivals stopped calling for her to quit as French finance minister once Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. “It is quite common that when the situation is very complicated, we’re not unhappy to give the reins to a woman.” Playing catch-up At the ECB, people close to Lagarde say she is determined to prove doubters wrong by taming inflation and putting the eurozone economy back on an even keel. Lagarde could not comment for this story because the ECB meets this week and officials avoid making public remarks that could influence expectations of monetary policy decisions.  She can seem dissatisfied at the bank. Having struggled to master German since arriving in Frankfurt, which was partly locked down because of the pandemic during her first two years there, she often spends free time with her family back home in France.  Lagarde also misses Washington. She enjoyed her globetrotting job at the IMF more than her new role at the ECB and she thinks of the US capital as a second home after spending a year there as a teenager on an American Field Service student exchange.  “The IMF misses her and I think she misses the IMF,” says a senior financier who has known Lagarde since she was based in the US and recently had lunch with her at the ECB’s still half-empty twin-tower headquarters in Germany’s financial centre. “She seems lonely, sitting up there in that big, gloomy tower with hardly anyone around.”  Insiders say Lagarde regrets relying for too long on the ECB’s forecasting models showing inflation was “transitory” and would soon fall back to its target. She also wishes it had ditched the constraints of the “forward guidance” put in place by her predecessor Mario Draghi, which delayed rate rises until the central bank stopped buying more bonds in June 2022. A waiter ensures social distancing. Views are mixed over how Lagarde has responded to the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic  © Patrick Hertzog/AFP/Getty Images As a result of these mis-steps, the ECB has decided to rely less on its forecasts, which consistently underestimated how high inflation would rise, and to scrap much of the formal guidance it gave about future policy moves.  Instead it has committed to put more weight on whether underlying prices, excluding energy and food, are slowing and to what degree higher borrowing costs are squeezing bank lending and economic activity, to determine its next rate moves. These changes mean the ECB has shifted from being one of the world’s most dovish central banks — it was one of only a handful to cut interest rates below zero in the 2010s — to being one of the more hawkish: it is expected to keep raising rates for longer than either the Fed or the BoE. “The ECB made one of the worst forecasting errors ever on inflation,” says Otmar Issing, the institution’s first chief economist when it was created in 1998. “It was a brutal wake-up call, but since then they have done a U-turn and been catching up quickly. You have to give them credit for that.” Having dismissed a surge in eurozone consumer prices in late 2021 as a “hump” that would soon pass without the need for rate rises, Lagarde has adopted a more determined stance since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, unleashing an energy crisis and double-digit price rises. This year she called inflation a “monster that we need to knock on the head”.  The ECB has raised borrowing costs at an unprecedented rate, lifting its deposit rate from minus 0.5 per cent last July to 3 per cent last month. At a meeting in Frankfurt on May 4, its governing council is widely expected to agree on another increase.   “They were too late to act when the Ukraine war started, energy prices shot up and there was little doubt inflation would become entrenched,” says Maria Demertzis, an economic policy professor at the European University Institute in Florence. “So now they are playing catch-up and cannot back down easily.” The worry for some analysts is that having been chided for being too slow to react to inflation, the ECB will now raise rates too high. Dovish council members are urging it to move cautiously, warning that its rate rises only act on inflation with a lag of at least a year. “We will only know in six months if we have done enough,” says one. “Because they have been criticised so much for starting late, and they are only human, they may respond by doing too much,” says Silvia Ardagna, chief European economist at UK bank Barclays. “They don’t have an easy job at all.” Some analysts think the council will slow the pace of rate rises to a quarter percentage point this week, reflecting growing uncertainty over how quickly inflation will fall. But Isabel Schnabel, the most hawkish member of the ECB’s executive board who has become an influential voice on policy, has said it could stick to a half-point rise if the data supports it. The size of this week’s move may hinge on figures to be published on Tuesday, showing the path of eurozone inflation in April as well as what banks in the bloc told the ECB about their lending plans in its latest survey of the sector. The behaviour of banks is being closely watched by central bankers because of the recent turmoil in the sector which triggered the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and pushed Credit Suisse into the arms of its rival UBS. Eurozone banks have so far proved resilient to the jitters — despite a worrying but shortlived drop in Deutsche Bank shares in late March.  Lagarde has adopted a more determined stance on rate hikes since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, unleashing an energy crisis and double-digit price rises © Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images But the upheaval is likely to intensify the contraction of credit supply that had already started in response to rising borrowing costs, leading to a record fall in demand for eurozone mortgages in the final months of last year. Economists say this will slow economic activity and lower inflation, reducing the amount of additional rate rises the ECB needs to do. “After the shock of what has happened, banks are going to be much more cautious today,” says Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, chair of French bank Société Générale and former ECB executive board member. “My concern is that if the ECB keep squeezing the financial system too much it may lead to a credit crunch.” These concerns are mostly falling on deaf ears among eurozone rate-setters, who pushed ahead with a half-point rate rise in March only a week after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and while Credit Suisse was still locked in talks about a rescue deal.  “These banks tend to overplay their own importance and assume we are playing to their tune,” says one ECB council member. “I don’t see these fears persuading us to focus less on fighting inflation.” The owl’s perspective This robust attitude reflects Lagarde’s decision to distance herself more from financial markets than her predecessor Draghi, who won plaudits from investors for promising to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro during a debt crisis a decade ago. “Some of them at the ECB seem to think what happens in financial markets doesn’t really matter,” says Stefan Gerlach, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland who is now chief economist at Swiss bank EFG. “But I think they are underestimating this risk and it could end badly.” Lagarde’s coolness towards financial markets has created a frosty relationship with analysts and investors, who privately moan about her lack of economics training, vague communications and even her tendency to read back official statements in response to questions at press conferences.  The ECB president has been irritated by the barbs, colleagues say. She has pointed out that neither Fed chair Jerome Powell nor BoE governor Andrew Bailey studied economics. While Draghi did an economics doctorate at MIT, Lagarde has watched footage of her predecessor to find that he read at least as much from pre-prepared statements as she does. Some central bank watchers see sexist double standards at work.  Realising she would not be able to dominate debates on monetary policy, Lagarde chose a different leadership style to Draghi. Eschewing the labels of “hawk” or “dove”, she describes herself as an “owl” sitting above the fray to bring rate-setters with diverging positions together around a common policy decision and then explaining it. Lagarde chose to adopt a different management style at the ECB from her predecessor Mario Draghi © Bernd Kammerer/Getty Images “Lagarde doesn’t lead in the same way, rather it seems she manages the governing council,” says Erik Nielsen, chief economics adviser at Italian bank UniCredit. “She doesn’t have a preset idea of where to go; she has an exceptionally good political ear, reads the room and manages to bring them to a decision.” Team spirit was in short supply when Lagarde took over at the ECB. Many council members had publicly attacked the decision to cut rates and restart bond purchases at one of Draghi’s last council meetings.  Council members praise Lagarde’s ability to win broad support for carefully constructed compromises even if they don’t always agree with every element. “Christine Lagarde is doing an excellent job,” Joachim Nagel, head of Germany’s central bank, told the FT recently. “She brings people with different views together to reach good decisions on a common monetary policy.” To build unity, Lagarde holds a regular call with the heads of the German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch central banks to discuss big moves before each policy meeting, while she or her chief economist Philip Lane also contact the 15 other national governors. However, some council members think her drive for togetherness is concealing subtle shifts in their debate. “Where there is room for discussion is if there is too much consensus,” Pierre Wunsch, head of Belgium’s central bank, tells the FT. “I think it removes relevant information from the market.”  ECB watchers say this partly explains why Lagarde sometimes surprises the market. “It is harder to communicate with one voice when there is a whole range of views out there,” says Jens Eisenschmidt, chief Europe economist at US bank Morgan Stanley who worked at the ECB until last year. “This makes it harder for the market to know what their next steps are and the precision of communication can suffer.” Knowing when to stop The closer the ECB gets to pausing its rate rises, the harder it will be for Lagarde to maintain unity. Already in March, there were a handful of dissenters who worried that raising rates was risky because of the banking turmoil. Its ultimate decision was attacked by both rightwing Italian politicians and left-leaning European trade union officials.  “It was relatively easy to agree on the need to raise rates to current levels, but it will get harder to deliver consensus as you have more cross-currents now,” says Sven Jari Stehn, chief Europe economist at US bank Goldman Sachs. He expects Lagarde to use a combination of other tools to win support for rate decisions, such as committing to further hikes, promising not to cut them for a period after pausing, or agreeing to speed up the shrinkage of the ECB’s balance sheet.  The eurozone economy expanded 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of the year, weaker than forecast but an improvement from stagnation at the end of 2022. Economists say this rebound, despite last year’s energy shock and the sharp rise in borrowing costs, reflects a build-up of excess savings during the pandemic, a boost from generous government subsidies and the recovery of global trade. While headline inflation has fallen for five consecutive months since peaking at a eurozone record of 10.6 per cent in October, the resilience of the economy coupled with rising profit margins and wages has kept core price pressures going up after excluding energy and food. Veteran central bankers sympathise with the ECB’s challenge of deciding when to stop raising rates, which they expect to test Lagarde’s leadership skills to their limits.  “We have a war in Ukraine, globalisation has slowed, supply chains are changing — to mention only a few factors,” says Issing, one of the eurozone’s founding fathers. “It is a situation of great uncertainty, which is very difficult to interpret correctly. There is a risk of overdoing it, but the risk of letting inflation run away is more important.” Data visualisation by Keith Fray","01.05.2023"

Treasuries may not have bottomed, but the short end pays you pretty well to wait. The set-up may not be great, but it’s loads better than what we were faced with a year ago. Email me: robert.armstrong@ft.com Eight big US stocks to watch in 2023 These are not stock picks; this is not a stock tips newsletter. What follows instead are eight big US stocks that stand to be really interesting in 2023. They either face interesting strategic challenges, exemplify key trends, or embody important uncertainties. Of course, if you were just looking for the most comprehensive market barometers, you’d get a kind of boring basket of megacaps (Walmart for the health of the mass consumer; JPMorgan for financial stability; Exxon for the energy market; and so on). I’ve tried to make this a touch more fun than that. Devon Energy Energy prices were, other than inflation, the biggest story in markets last year, and energy was the only sector that posted positive returns. The year ended with a fascinating development: energy prices fell a lot, but energy stocks did not. The market seems to be pricing in a rebound in energy commodities, and if that doesn’t happen, energy stocks are going to get whacked. No better way to follow that drama than with Devon, which is a leveraged play on oil. Its shares are up almost sixfold since the middle of 2020, when WTI crude was at half its current level. Yet Devon’s shares have hung on to much of their gains as WTI has fallen from $120 to $80 a barrel.  If oil prices should bounce (it’s hard to predict!) Devon will be part of another drama, too. Will companies in the US shale patch maintain the capital discipline that (with some encouragement from Wall Street) has become their new orthodoxy? The street wants free cash flow. Oil people like cash well enough — but they really like drilling wells. Meta Meta is fascinating in that it is the first of the giant US tech companies to go from being a growth stock to being a value stock. It happened fast. Its price/earnings ratio has gone from 30 to 11 in two years. Will management (read: Mark Zuckerberg) acknowledge that it is now a slow-growth company? Will it find a new constituency among value investors as the growth types head for the exits? Unhedged has already said what we think needs doing, but we suspect Zuck has different ideas. It’s hard to think of a company that has made the growth-value transition smoothly. Walmart’s growth started to peter out at the turn of the millennium, and its shares stagnated for more than a decade. Perhaps there are market historians out there who can think of better examples? Boston Properties Boston owns city centre office buildings. There are too many of them, now that people work from home. Some of the buildings have turned into zombies. Boston’s share price, accordingly, has been cut in half since the coronavirus pandemic began. UBS analyst Michael Goldsmith sums up Boston’s situation with an audible sigh: Macro factors are having an outsized impact on fundamentals, which are likely to get worse before they get better. These headwinds have caused demand to slow in the tech & life science sectors that have been key demand drivers the last decade. Simultaneously, rising interest rates are pushing interest expense higher. This makes investments less accretive and in some cases dilutive . . . there are more questions than answers on office demand . . . We suspect investors will need to see evidence of demand improving before rewarding shares with a multiple closer to historical levels. From an investor point of view, half off is a nice place to start. And if any office property company can hang in there, it is probably Boston, which has high-quality properties in great locations. But if Boston wobbles further, that means the office property sector is in a simply awful mess. Invitation Homes Another real estate company, but interesting for a very different reason. Invitation rents out about 75,000 single-family homes. Demand has been incredibly strong, occupancy has been high, overdue rents low, and the company has been able to jack up rents —  by 16 per cent on new leases in the first three quarters of last year. This won’t go on forever, but how quickly will things change? Rest assured, Invitation, if anyone does, knows what the market will bear. The stock market appears to be betting that wage growth will fall and rents will follow: Invitations’ shares are back down to pre-pandemic levels. The stock has never been cheap and still isn’t, at over 40 times earnings. On the other hand, might higher mortgage rates support rental demand?  Chipotle The burrito chain is an interesting measure of consumer demand, in that it is a good-sized step up in price from fast food, but is not quite a luxury good, either. Same-store sales rose 7.6 per cent in the third quarter; a bit less than half of that came from price increases. That’s good growth, but a lot slower than 2021. Interesting questions: will demand hold up as pandemic savings continue to dwindle, or will hungry consumers trade down? Specifically, will demand continue to keep pace with wages, which are a third of Chipotle’s costs? All of this gets more interesting in a recession, given Chipotle’s “affordable luxury” status. Like Invitation Homes, the stock is down but not cheap. Disney The streaming industry has a pricing problem. Consumers love streaming movies and shows because it represents low-cost, all-out-limitless choice. Yet the economics stink, at least compared to what went before, for the people who make the movies and shows. The TV industry is starting to look like what the airline industry has looked historically: consumers are capturing most of the value. It is worthwhile to recall how the newspaper industry responded when a change in its primary mode of distribution led to a pricing crisis: with a massive, ugly reduction in capacity, from which a few profitable (but not very profitable) players emerged. Shares in Disney, Warner Brothers, Netflix and Paramount all fell by at least twice as much as the market last year. I’m not sure the mayhem is over. Disney has the best content and strongest financial position to start coming up with a solution. It will be fun to watch as they try to figure this mess out. Caterpillar A straightforward economic bellwether, particularly useful for its significant exposure to China and Chinese real estate. Right now, however, there is an interesting twist: this cyclical stock has not received the memo that the cycle is turning. The shares were up 16 per cent last year, and its results have been remarkably strong. The situation is reminiscent of the gap between oil prices and the prices of oil stocks. Either Unhedged and most other people are wrong about the trajectory of the world economy, or Cat’s stock price has to come down. Bank OZK You want a bank that’s going to tell you how the US economy is doing? JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and their ilk are too big, too diversified, and too global to give you much of a signal. What you need is a good old rate sensitive midsized bank with lots of commercial real estate exposure — because most small and midsized business lending is real estate lending, more or less. It’s hard to find a decent-sized bank with more commercial real estate lending than OZK: almost 70 per cent of its loans are in non-residential real estate, spread all across the country. If you have a contrarian bullish view on the US economy or are, alternatively, looking for a canary in the default rates coal mine, OZK is interesting. We’re very curious to hear which stocks readers are keeping their eyes on. You know how to find us. One good read A good case against sending people to Mars. Thanks to Tyler Cowen for the pointer.","03.01.2023"
"A close Suisse shave","Credit Suisse’s rollercoaster rights issue shows risks even for a Justice League of underwriters","Craig Coben is a former senior investment banker at Bank of America, where he served most recently as co-head of global capital markets for the Asia-Pacific region. Yesterday Credit Suisse announced that its shareholders subscribed to 98.2 per cent of its rights issue. That’s an impressive level of take-up, but it was nail-biting suspense until the end.  The CS share price fell so much during the rights issue period that late last week it looked like the underwriters might end up owning a significant chunk of the Swiss bank’s stock. This would have been a nasty shock to everyone involved, including the market.   In the end, the shares rebounded and the rights issue completed successfully. But the close shave has exposed some unresolved and perhaps unresolvable issues that arise when investment banks underwrite capital-raises for companies.  Launched as part of a SFr4bn capital increase and organisational overhaul, Credit Suisse’s SFr2.24bn rights issue should have been smooth sailing. For one thing, the new shares were being offered at SFr2.52 per share, a meaty 32 per cent discount to the dilution-adjusted price (aka “theoretical ex-rights price” or TERP).  Moreover, CS was able to assemble a massive syndicate of 19 banks to underwrite the fundraise at SFr2.52. The rights issue was also accompanied by a SFr1.76bn share placement to investors, mostly the Saudi National Bank, with a further commitment from those investors to exercise their rights to buy shares.  So this capital increase had the building blocks for success: (1) a deep discount to ensure that shareholders exercise the rights to buy shares, (2) a Justice League-strength underwriting syndicate, and (3) the presence of a cornerstone investor.  Yet the rights issue caused some sweaty palms. Battered by client outflows and a profit warning, Credit Suisse shares tumbled from the late October announcement. On 1st December the shares skidded to SFr2.667, meaning the discount to buy shares in the rights issue had contracted from 32 per cent to just 5.5 per cent. That’s waaaay too close for comfort.  The vast majority of rights issues are anticlimaxes. As long as the shares stay well above the subscription price, shareholders have every incentive to exercise the right and buy shares at a discount. And since the underwriting banks aren’t actually selling shares, there is none of the stress or uncertainty of collecting orders and building a book of investor demand, as there is in an IPO or share placement.  What matters is that the share price does not get too close to the underwritten price. It can drift or drop a bit, but not crumble or crater. A 32 per cent discount is a big cushion, and such a sizeable discount is why some investors disparage the fees that banks earn for underwriting as “money for old rope”: the underwriters are pocketing a fee for taking on the very remote risk of being stuck with shares. Yet rights issue underwriting has two features that can turn money for old rope into a noose around the neck of underwriters. First, it exemplifies what Nassim Taleb and others call “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.” The underwriters collect fees of around 2 per cent, but in the extraordinarily unlikely event that the share price collapses, they could be left with a big position in a stock they don’t want to hold. The “pennies in front of a steamroller” situation typically arises when a party writes (sells) a low-value derivative, such as a deeply out-of-the-money option or a credit default swap. That party collects the premium, and there is little chance of the option ever being exercised or the CDS being triggered. But in the extreme case it is exercised, the party can find itself nursing big losses. To be clear, the underwriters did not enter into an actual derivative contract with Credit Suisse. There was no ISDA documentation, and the exposure never sat in a derivatives book. But by underwriting at the deep discount, the banks sold Credit Suisse the functional equivalent of a short-expiry, deeply out-of-the-money put. If shareholders hadn’t bought shares in the rights issue, then CS could have “put” shares to the underwriters at SFr2.52 per share. Thus the underwriting has the substance, but not the form, of a derivative option. And the size of that de facto derivative is enormous as a percentage of market capitalisation or trading volume. There is no way to buy an equivalent out-of-the-money put in such size in the regular trading market. And no market counterparty would ever write one, either.  A second, albeit related problem, is that there is virtually no way to hedge the underwriting of Credit Suisse shares either. When writing an option, most market players hedge their positions. But here it’s practically impossible. For one thing, shorting CS shares is likely prohibited in the underwriting agreement and in any case would be self-defeating as a hedge, as you would be pushing the share price down — it would be akin to an animal eating its own tail to feed itself. For another, shorting a basket of other peer stocks will create mismatches (known as “basis risk”): in the middle of a major corporate event, Credit Suisse shares had their own dynamic, and they could not be expected to closely correlate to UBS or other European banking shares. Buying Credit Suisse credit default swaps would also have been difficult as a hedge, given the illiquidity and idiosyncrasies of that market, and it may have been barred in the underwriting agreement anyway. The underwriters of a rights issue can hedge against a market crash via index options, but not a stock-specific one. An index hedge here might have generated significant losses, because the broader market rallied hard from the time of the deal’s announcement. So when shares get perilously close to the subscription price, what can the underwriters do to manage their risk? Not much. You can stare at the terminal screen to will the shares higher, but if Uri Geller couldn’t stop Brexit with his telepathy, an investment banker won’t have more sway even if they are doing God’s work. More practically, you can lob in communication advice to management, but at such a late stage it’s usually like screaming in a wind tunnel. Fortunately, a sharp rally in Credit Suisse came in the nick of time, lifting the share price above SFr3 last Friday after chair Axel Lehmann said that outflows had stopped. This good news was followed by weekend media reports about possible investments by the Saudi Crown Prince and Bob Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital into its First Boston investment bank spin-off. As FT Alphaville wrote: “Timing’s pretty convenient.” But you can’t always count on such deus ex machina to save the day. It is extremely rare, but rights issues can leave underwriters stuck with an outsized rump of stock. The cumulative underwriting losses on July’s €2bn rights issue for Italian oilfield services firm Saipem may have exceeded €100mn. In the end, the underwriters will have made money on the Credit Suisse rights issue. But the close shave is a reminder that rights issues expose underwriters to equity risk that is both unhedgeable and many times larger than their reward.","09.12.2022"
"After the easy money: a giant stress test for the financial system","Central banks are caught between tackling rising prices and ensuring stability but their actions hold risks for investors and borrowers","Five weeks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, there is no consensus on whether the ensuing financial stress in North America and Europe has run its course or is a foretaste of worse to come.  Equally pressing is the question of whether, against the backdrop of still high inflation, central banks in advanced economies will soon row back from monetary tightening and pivot towards easing. These questions, which are of overwhelming importance for investors, savers and mortgage borrowers, are closely related. For if banks and other financial institutions face liquidity crises when inflation is substantially above the central banks’ target, usually of about 2 per cent, acute tension arises between their twin objectives of price stability and financial stability. In the case of the US Federal Reserve, the price stability objective also conflicts with the goal of maximum employment.   The choices made by central banks will have a far-reaching impact on our personal finances. If inflation stays higher for longer, there will be further pain for those who have invested in supposedly safe bonds for their retirement. If the central banks fail to engineer a soft landing for the economy, investors in risk assets such as equities will be on the rack. And for homeowners looking to refinance their loans over the coming months, any further tightening by the Bank of England will feed into mortgage costs.  The bubble bursts SVB, the 16th largest bank in the US, perfectly illustrates how the central banks’ inflation and financial stability objectives are potentially in conflict. It had been deluged with mainly uninsured deposits — deposits above the official $250,000 insurance ceiling — that far exceeded lending opportunities in its tech industry stamping ground. So it invested the money in medium and long-dated Treasury and agency securities. It did so without hedging against interest rate risk in what was the greatest bond market bubble in history.  The very sharp rise in policy rates over the past year pricked the bubble, so depressing the value of long-dated bonds. This would not have been a problem if depositors retained confidence in the bank so that it could hold the securities to maturity. Yet, in practice, rich but nervous uninsured depositors worried that SVB was potentially insolvent if the securities were marked to market.   An inept speech by chief executive Greg Becker on March 9 quickly spread across the internet, causing a quarter of the bank’s deposit base to flee in less than a day and pushing SVB into forced sales of bonds at huge losses. The collapse of confidence soon extended to Signature Bank in New York, which was overextended in property and increasingly involved in crypto assets. Some 90 per cent of its deposits were uninsured, compared with 88 per cent at SVB. Fear spread to Europe, where failures of risk management and a series of scandals at Credit Suisse caused deposits to ebb away. The Swiss authorities quickly brokered a takeover by arch rival UBS, while in the UK the Bank of England secured a takeover of SVB’s troubled UK subsidiary by HSBC for £1.  These banks do not appear to constitute a homogeneous group. Yet, in their different ways, they demonstrate how the long period of super-low interest rates since the great financial crisis of 2007-09 introduced fragilities into the financial system while creating asset bubbles. As Jon Danielsson and Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics point out, the longer monetary policy stayed lax, the more systemic risk increased, along with a growing dependence on money creation and low rates.  The ultimate consequence was to undermine financial stability. Putting that right would require an increase in the capital base of the banking system. Yet, as Danielsson and Goodhart indicate, increasing capital requirements when the economy is doing poorly, as it is now, is conducive to recession because it reduces banks’ lending capacity. So we are back to the policy tensions outlined earlier. Part of the problem of such protracted lax policy was that it bred complacency. Many banks that are now struggling with rising interest rates had assumed, like SVB, that interest rates would remain low indefinitely and that central banks would always come to the rescue. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that US banks’ unrealised losses on securities were $620bn at the end of 2022.  A more direct consequence, noted by academics Raghuram Rajan and Viral Acharya, respectively former governor and deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, is that the central banks’ quantitative easing since the financial crisis, whereby they bought securities in bulk from the markets, drove an expansion of banks’ balance sheets and stuffed them with flighty uninsured deposits. Rajan and Acharya add that supervisors in the US did not subject all banks to the same level of scrutiny and stress testing that they applied to the largest institutions. So these differential standards may have caused a migration of risky commercial real estate loans from larger, better-capitalised banks to weakly capitalised small and midsized banks. There are grounds for thinking that this may be less of an issue in the UK, as we shall see.   A further vulnerability in the system relates to the grotesque misallocation of capital arising not only from the bubble-creating propensity of lax monetary policy but from ultra-low interest rates keeping unprofitable “zombie” companies alive. The extra production capacity that this kept in place exerted downward pressure on prices.  Today’s tighter policy, the most draconian tightening in four decades in the advanced economies with the notable exception of Japan, will wipe out much of the zombie population, thereby restricting supply and adding to inflationary impetus. Note that the total number of company insolvencies registered in the UK in 2022 was the highest since 2009 and 57 per cent higher than 2021. A system under strain  In effect, the shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening and sharply increased interest rates has imposed a gigantic stress test on both the financial system and the wider economy. What makes the test especially stressful is the huge increase in debt that was encouraged by years of easy money.   William White, former chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements and one of the few premier league economists to foresee the great financial crisis, says ultra easy money “encouraged people to take out debt to do dumb things”. The result is that the combined debt of households, companies and governments in relation to gross domestic product has risen to levels never before seen in peacetime. All this suggests a huge increase in the scope for accidents in the financial system. And while the upsets of the past few weeks have raised serious questions about the effectiveness of bank regulation and supervision, there is one respect in which the regulatory response to the great financial crisis has been highly effective. It has caused much traditional banking activity to migrate to the non-bank financial sector, including hedge funds, money market funds, pensions funds and other institutions that are much less transparent than the regulated banking sector and thus capable of springing nasty systemic surprises.  An illustration of this came in the UK last September following the announcement by Liz Truss’s government of unfunded tax cuts in its “mini” Budget. It sparked a rapid and unprecedented increase in long-dated gilt yields and a consequent fall in prices. This exposed vulnerabilities in liability-driven investment funds in which many pension funds had invested in order to hedge interest rate risk and inflation risk.  Such LDI funds invested in assets, mainly gilts and derivatives, that generated cash flows that were timed to match the incidence of pension outgoings. Much of the activity was fuelled by borrowing. UK defined-benefit pension funds, where pensions are related to final or career average pay, have a near-uniform commitment to liability matching. This led to overconcentration at the long end of both the fixed-interest and index-linked gilt market, thereby exacerbating the severe repricing in gilts after the announcement. There followed a savage spiral of collateral calls and forced gilt sales that destabilised a market at the core of the British financial system, posing a devastating risk to financial stability and the retirement savings of millions.  This was not entirely unforeseen by the regulators, who had run stress tests to see whether the LDI funds could secure enough liquidity from their pension fund clients to meet margin calls in difficult circumstances. But they did not allow for such an extreme swing in gilt yields.   Worried that this could lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction in the flow of credit to households and businesses, the BoE stepped in to the market with a temporary programme of gilt purchases. The purpose was to give LDI funds time to build their resilience and encourage stronger buffers to cope with future volatility in the gilts market.    The intervention was highly successful in terms of stabilising the market. Yet, by expanding its balance sheet when it was committed to balance sheet shrinkage in the interest of normalising interest rates and curbing inflation, the BoE planted seeds of doubt in the minds of some market participants. Would financial stability always trump the central bank’s commitment to deliver on price stability? And what further dramatic repricing incidents could prompt dangerous systemic shocks?  Inflation before all? The most obvious scope for sharp repricing relates to market expectations about inflation. In the short term, inflation is set to fall as global price pressures fall back and supply chain disruption is easing, especially now China continues to reopen after Covid-19 lockdowns. The BoE Monetary Policy Committee’s central projection is for consumer price inflation to fall from 9.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 to just under 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The support offered by the Fed and other central banks to ailing financial institutions leaves room for a little more policy tightening and the strong possibility that this will pave the way for disinflation and recession. The point was underlined this week by the IMF, which warned that “the chances of a hard landing” for the global economy had risen sharply if high inflation persists.  Yet, in addition to the question mark over central banks’ readiness to prioritise fighting inflation over financial stability, there are longer-run concerns about negative supply shocks that could keep upward pressure on inflation beyond current market expectations, according to White. For a start, Covid-19 and geopolitical friction are forcing companies to restructure supply lines, increasing resilience but reducing efficiency. The supply of workers has been hit by deaths and long Covid.  White expects the production of fossil fuels and metals to suffer from recently low levels of investment, especially given the long lags in bringing new production on stream. He also argues that markets underestimate the inflationary impact of climate change and, most importantly, the global supply of workers is in sharp decline, pushing up wage costs everywhere. Where does the UK stand in all this? The resilience of the banking sector has been greatly strengthened since the financial crisis of 2007-08, with the loan-to-deposit ratios of big UK banks falling from 120 per cent in 2008 to 75 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Much more of the UK banks’ bond portfolios are marked to market for regulatory and accounting purposes than in the US. The strength of sterling since the departure of the Truss government means the UK’s longstanding external balance sheet risk — its dependence on what former BoE governor Mark Carney called “the kindness of strangers” — has diminished somewhat. Yet huge uncertainties remain as interest rates look set to take one last upward step. Risks for borrowers and investors For mortgage borrowers, the picture is mixed. The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee estimates that half the UK’s 4mn owner-occupier mortgages will be exposed to rate rises in 2023. But, in its latest report in March, the BoE’s FPC says its worries about the affordability of mortgage payments have lessened because of falling energy prices and the better outlook for employment. The continuing high level of inflation is reducing the real value of mortgage debt. And, if financial stability concerns cause the BoE to stretch out the period over which it brings inflation back to its 2 per cent target, the real burden of debt will be further eroded.   For investors, the possibility — I would say probability — that inflationary pressures are now greater than they have been for decades raises a red flag, at least over the medium and long term, for fixed-rate bonds. And, for private investors, index-linked bonds offer no protection unless held to maturity.  That is a huge assumption given the unknown timing of mortality and the possibility of bills for care in old age that may require investments to be liquidated. Note that the return on index-linked gilts in 2022 was minus 38 per cent, according to consultants LCP. When fixed-rate bond yields rise and prices fall, index-linked yields are pulled up by the same powerful tide. Of course, in asset allocation there can be no absolute imperatives. It is worth recounting the experience in the 1970s of George Ross Goobey, founder of the so-called “cult of the equity” in the days when most pension funds invested exclusively in gilts.  While running the Imperial Tobacco pension fund after the war he famously sold all the fund’s fixed-interest securities and invested exclusively in equities — with outstanding results. Yet, in 1974, he put a huge bet on “War Loan” when it was yielding 17 per cent and made a killing. If the price is right, even fixed-interest IOUs can be a bargain in a period of rip-roaring inflation.   A final question raised by the banking stresses of recent weeks is whether it is ever worth investing in banks. In a recent FT Money article, Terry Smith, chief executive of Fundsmith and a former top-rated bank analyst, says not. He never invests in anything that requires leverage (or borrowing) to make an adequate return, as is true of banks. The returns in banking are poor, anyway. And, even when a bank is well run, it can be destroyed by a systemic panic.  Smith adds that technology is supplanting traditional banking. And, he asks rhetorically, have you noticed that your local bank branch has become a PizzaExpress, in which role, by the way, it makes more money?  A salutary envoi to the tale of the latest spate of bank failures.   ","14.04.2023"
"A pharma partnership that brought a breakthrough in breast cancer","Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s Enhertu could double time patients can live without their condition progressing","It is not often that a drug receives a standing ovation. When Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca announced impressive results for their breast cancer treatment Enhertu, oncologists took to their feet to applaud.  “It was a goosebump moment, sending shivers down my spine,” said Susan Galbraith, who leads oncology research and development at AstraZeneca.  Ken Keller, chief executive of AZ’s Japanese partner on the drug, deliberately stood apart from his team at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting to see the mood of the crowd. “People had basically tears of joy in their eyes,” he said.  But the man who had brought the two companies together — pioneering oncologist José Baselga — did not live to witness the drug’s reception. He died in 2021 aged 61 from a rare brain disease.  One in eight women will get breast cancer in their lifetime — and Enhertu has the potential to change treatment for half of them. David Fredrickson, executive vice-president of the oncology business at AstraZeneca, said the drug “blows up the swim lanes” that previously defined the treatment of breast cancer. For a large group of patients, he said, it could be “one of the most important medicines ever”. Enhertu was first approved in the US in 2019 for a subset of patients with cancer that has high levels of a protein called HER2. About 15 to 20 per cent of breast cancers are HER2-positive but last June a trial showed that the drug could double the time patients can live without their cancer progressing, even if they have low levels of this protein. About a fifth of the participants with metastatic cancer — usually seen as uncurable —  had complete responses: scans could not detect their tumours.  Vials of Enhertu on a manufacturing line © Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca The drug has transformed Daiichi Sankyo into an oncology company. And it is further proof that AstraZeneca, a leader in the field, knows when to pounce: its unorthodox move to raise $3.5bn on the public markets to help pay for the $6.9bn deal to develop and sell the drug looks set to more than pay off. Analysts are forecasting about $10bn a year in Enhertu sales at their peak.   In 2005, Daiichi merged with Sankyo, bringing together chemists from the former and biologists from the latter who would go on to create Enhertu.  The drug builds on a history of targeting the HER2 protein which dates back to Roche’s launch of Herceptin in 1998. Just like with Herceptin, scientists used an artificial antibody to hook on to the HER2 protein on a cancer cell. But they improved on current treatments by creating a strong link to a more powerful molecule that breaks down enzymes and kills cancer cells.    When they tried it in mice, they could see it worked better than the market leader, Roche’s Kadcyla. But Daiichi had never made a cancer drug. “In the end, science won the day back then,” said Ken Takeshita, global head of R&D at Daiichi. “It was courageous for this company to say, we’re going to steer away from being a cardiovascular company.”  Keller wished he could say that he knew how promising the drug was at that point. By about 2015, the technology started to look “pretty spectacular”. “But there’s a lot of drugs that look spectacular in animal studies,” he said.  He was more convinced after the first study in humans: a hard-to-treat population that had tried several other drugs. “At that point, almost nothing works. And we were seeing the tumour shrink dramatically,” he said.  Keller credits the chief executive of the time, George Nakayama, with making two big bets: focusing the company on Enhertu, and working with AstraZeneca.    Baselga joined AstraZeneca in early 2019 as head of oncology research and development. He had been forced to resign from his post as physician-in-chief at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer centre because of a failure to disclose payments from healthcare companies, which the American Association for Cancer Research later concluded was “inadvertent”.  But while there, he had led the phase 2 trial for Enhertu, seeing first hand how it was helping patients. In his first week at AstraZeneca, he pushed the idea that AstraZeneca should have a partnership with Daiichi.   Fredrickson said Baselga’s extensive experience studying breast cancer meant that he and AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot sat up and listened. Soriot had already built AstraZeneca into an oncology powerhouse, producing blockbusters like Tagrisso and Lynparza. “José really gave us the conviction that this was a medicine that AstraZeneca needed to be a part of,” Fredrickson said.  Daiichi split the rights 50/50 with AstraZeneca, outside of Japan, in return for AZ conducting further clinical trials. Michael Leuchten, an analyst at UBS, said it was a “very, very clever deal”. “What did AstraZeneca see that others missed?” he asked, adding that the company has proved repeatedly it can make good decisions. For Daiichi, AstraZeneca offered oncology expertise and money. To make the most of Enhertu’s potential, they are planning 40 trials, one of the largest programmes in the industry. They are asking huge unanswered questions: does Enhertu work in earlier stages of breast cancer? It has already been approved for some types of other cancers like gastric and lung, where HER2 shows up; but how many more could it tackle?  “We have so many potential cancers that we can study and sometimes it’s a bit challenging to find all the people and all the resources,” Takeshita said.  The biggest opportunity is early-stage breast cancer. The earlier cancer is treated the better, so it could make an even bigger difference earlier.  Susan Galbraith at AstraZeneca: ‘It was a goosebump moment, sending shivers down my spine’ © Handout Nick Turner, an academic consultant medical oncologist at the UK’s Institute of Cancer Research, who specialises in breast cancer but was not involved in the Enhertu trials, said it is very likely in the future that oncologists will prescribe Enhertu instead of the previous standard medicine, Kadcyla.  “We’ll then be on the way to really curing the substantial majority of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer,” Turner said.  Roche said Kadcyla will still be an important option for patients, with its well-established record of safety and efficacy, and the company is exploring using it in combination with another of its cancer drugs. However, Enhertu has significant side effects. Patients often have the same side effects well known from chemotherapy — such as sickness and hair loss — and there is much smaller risk of developing a serious lung condition. Early-stage patients tend to take a drug for longer and they may find it hard to tolerate over time.   Daiichi is also creating other drugs based on the same platform as Enhertu, one of which is also part of a partnership with AstraZeneca. Gareth Powell, head of healthcare at specialist fund manager Polar Capital, said Enhertu has helped take AstraZeneca to a “whole new level in terms of growth potential” — and when sales take off, would ultimately boost margins at Daiichi.  “At some point, this product gets so big, you can’t spend it fast enough in terms of investment,” he said.  Analysts at Credit Suisse in London said the competition is at least three years behind. They believe if all of the treatments based on the platform that combines antibodies with a molecule to kill cancer cells in the pipeline are successful, it could add up to an opportunity as big as Merck’s blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, which hit $17.2bn in sales in 2021. But they warned that investor expectations are already very high, so that if anything did go wrong, it could hit shares in AstraZeneca.   For patients, Enhertu promises time. Emma Fisher was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 when she was just 35, and two years later, found out it had spread. The average lifespan of someone with secondary breast cancer is two to five years.  Fisher’s private health insurance paid for the drug, but she testified to the UK’s National Institute of Clinical Excellence to try to persuade authorities to pay for it for everyone on the NHS. NICE now covers the drug for many patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and will consider it for cancers with low levels of HER2 in 2023.  “Twelve months is a phenomenally long amount of time. It might not sound like a huge amount of time to somebody who doesn’t have incurable cancer. But for somebody with incurable cancer, an extra 12 months is everything,” she said. The chart depicting the results from the Enhertu trial has been amended since initial publication to clarify that the figures relate to Destiny Breast-04 only, which was in HER2 low patients only, not in patients with high levels of HER2. ","06.01.2023"
"The view and views from Davos","Plus, MasMovil appeals to regulators for a tie-up with Orange and Peter Thiel’s fund makes a surprising crypto move","One thing to start: Reed Hastings is stepping down as chief executive of Netflix, the company he co-founded 25 years ago, in a shake-up at the top of one of the most powerful studios in Hollywood. Reed Hastings said in a blog post that it was the ‘right time to complete my succession’ © AFP via Getty Images Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: DD goes to DavosMasMovil makes its casePeter Thiel’s flip on crypto Davos gets the band back together For two Januarys in a row, the Swiss ski resort of Davos stood devoid of the billionaires, chief executives, politicians and corporate schmoozers that typically crowd its streets this time of year for the World Economic Forum.  When it returned last May, rescheduled because of an outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, surging inflation and Chinese lockdowns left the atmosphere feeling unseasonably chilly. This time, though, many attendees were in surprisingly high spirits. And not just because they’d spent too much time on the dance floor at the McKinsey ‘nightcap’ or had one too many at Anthony Scaramucci’s wine tasting. DD joined the throngs of financial elite to gauge the mood among dealmakers for what’s to come in 2023. The message circulated behind closed doors and on the Promenade was this: inflation will be tamed, said many, and China’s faster than expected reopening has fuelled optimism about rekindling ties between the world’s second-largest economy and the west.  “Considering all the things that have happened the world is a lot better than you would have expected,” JPMorgan Chase’s chief operating officer Daniel Pinto. One senior banker was so bullish he told DD to “forget hard or soft landing, there could be no landing”. Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman at Davos © Bloomberg The return of Winter Davos was an even bigger who’s who of Wall Street than usual as executives who passed on last year’s subdued festivities made reappearances.   Blackstone boss Stephen Schwarzman was spotted strutting about in his Légion d’Honneur pin and a pair of blue velvet pants so luxurious that one CNBC anchor felt them for themselves — a scene described to DD as “a real Davos moment”. Business celebrities weren’t the only headliners. DD spotted actor Idris Elba and model Naomi Campbell.  Keir Starmer, head of the UK’s Labour party, worked the crowds from day to night, rubbing elbows with global finance heads, throwing jabs at Rishi Sunak and mingling with his predecessors Tony Blair and David Miliband. Dare we say he was trying to throw around “future prime minister” vibes? Britain’s Labour leader Keir Starmer, left, and the party’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves at Davos © REUTERS Despite his best efforts, the UK became a bit of a punching bag this past week.  Bankers in continental Europe told DD they felt the need to remind their London-based colleagues to cheer up. Business in the EU is doing relatively better, even if the UK continues to plumb new lows. Meanwhile, UK bankers’ counterparts in the Gulf had no shortage of cash to throw around. In an effort to flex their financial prowess and prove they’re about more than just oil, dealmakers from the Middle East took centre stage.  If the Saudi National Bank’s move into Credit Suisse wasn’t evidence of that enough, comments from Saudi finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan that the country hopes to help “bridge the gap” between the US and China suggest more action to come. First Abu Dhabi Bank’s bid for Standard Chartered is dead on paper, but sentiment surrounding the deal still felt as warm as the hot chocolate being served outside the Emirates Promenade pavilion. Everyone had an opinion on Wall Street financier Michael Klein’s new investment bank, aka CS First Boston (soon to be just “First Boston”) and the fact that he’s a former Credit Suisse board member. (Rolling out Swiss hero Roger Federer at its VIP dinner might’ve been an attempt by the bank to score points with critics.) Davos certainly brought the party this year, even if not all of the celebration was well-received. (Microsoft’s invite-only Sting concert went down well with the select attendees, but perhaps not the company’s 10,000 employees whose jobs are about to be cut.) One gloomier spot — despite private equity executives’ best efforts to keep the good times rolling — is the outlook on dealmaking and IPOs. A stricter global regulatory regime could also threaten big deals such as Microsoft’s $10bn bet on ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Manchester United’s lounge at Davos © AFP via Getty Images Oh, and one last thing: despite the Glazer family’s efforts to sell Manchester United, the club said its luxury shop/lounge at Davos was “definitely not” aimed at courting potential buyers. Yeah, sure.  Regulators leave a European telecoms tie-up on hold Orange and MasMovil are hoping to combine their Spanish operations in a proposed €19.6bn joint venture that would aim to streamline Europe’s fragmented telecoms market. But Brussels insiders warn the deal will face deep scrutiny. On Thursday, MasMovil’s chief Meinrad Spenger met the EU’s competition boss Margrethe Vestager to make the case, people with knowledge of the meeting told DD’s Javier Espinoza. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager © JULIEN WARNAND/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The deal is pro-competition and pro-innovation in a market filled with mavericks, the company argued, adding that because the companies have no intention of increasing prices, regulators should sign off on the deal with few qualms.  A tie-up would also bring some much-needed cushioning for both parties. The past few years have been particularly painful for the European telecoms sector, during which the values of major players including BT and Vodafone in the UK, Telefónica in Spain and Orange have been slashed in half.  MasMovil, which was taken private in 2020 after a leveraged buyout by KKR, Providence Equity Partners and Cinven, bought smaller rival Euskaltel last year for €2.1bn. Adding Orange into the mix would make the combined entity the largest mobile operator in Spain. Antitrust watchdogs aren’t convinced. “This is not going to be easy for the companies,” said a person with intimate knowledge of Brussels’ probe. “This is the merger of two important players with important market share. They are in for a longer ride than they think.” Best-case scenario? The deal will be cleared after a prolonged probe. But some still expect the company to offer remedies to fully appease competition concerns.  Thiel’s crypto contradiction Last April, billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel addressed the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami. “We are at the end of the fiat money regime,” he declared, throwing wads of $100 bills into the crowd. Bitcoin sceptic Warren Buffett was a “sociopathic grandpa”, he added, predicting that there would be a 100x increase in the price of the digital currency. Around that time, Thiel’s San Francisco-based venture capital business, Founders Fund, was quietly coming to the end of a major sell-off of its own bitcoin position, the FT’s Tabby Kinder and Richard Waters report. Peter Thiel © Getty Images Founders Fund had been buying up cryptocurrencies — the vast majority of it bitcoin — since 2014 on Thiel’s advice. A vocal libertarian, Thiel was an early supporter of crypto while other mainstream investors stayed away over concerns about cyber security and money laundering. But by the end of March 2022, Founders Fund had closed almost all of its eight-year bet on crypto, selling off its bitcoin and other digital assets. The decision generated around $1.8bn in returns for its investors, one of whom is Thiel, according to people close to the fund. It was fortuitous timing. In May, the crypto world became swept up in crisis with a series of high-profile bankruptcies and the price of bitcoin crashing to a two-year low of around $15,500 — around 76 per cent down from an all-time high of $65,000. The year only got worse when Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX imploded amid allegations of fraud. Now Founders Fund has no significant exposure to crypto, the people close to the fund said. Thiel, who was the first venture backer of Facebook, is known for his prescient timing. It appears he has played another good hand. Job moves Deutsche Bank has hired Barclays and American Express veteran Laura Padovani as head of compliance, according to a memo seen by DD.Lazard has promoted Nathan Paul to global chief operating officer and vice- chair of its asset management business, DD can reveal.Moelis has hired M&A veteran Skip Fahrholz as a senior dealmaker within its private funds advisory group in London.

He was a senior adviser at the firm from 2019-2021 before being elected as Italy’s minister of technological innovation. Smart reads Fake it ‘til you make it Charlie Javice pulled off a deal most young founders could only dream of: selling her fintech start-up to JPMorgan for $175mn. The only problem was that most of its users weren’t real. Forbes probed her swift rise and fall. Arm wrestling In the battle to float British semiconductor darling Arm, the London Stock Exchange has little to offer except political turmoil and an outflow of talent, Craig Coben, a former senior investment banker at Bank of America, argues in an Alphaville post.

"Nato boss seeks to strengthen Asian alliances","Also, peak Big Tech among earnings and UK strike action spreads","This article is an on-site version of our The Week Ahead newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Sunday Hello and welcome to the working week. Can we afford to be more optimistic about the future? The next seven days are beginning more positively for global geopolitics with a visit by Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg to South Korea and Japan.  He will travel from Seoul to Tokyo on Monday to reinforce the transatlantic security alliance’s ties with its key partners in Asia. The meetings, which follow Japan and South Korea’s involvement for the first time in European Nato summits, demonstrate the alliance’s support for these countries in the face of security challenges posed by China and North Korea.  The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda, with Tokyo and Seoul likely to confirm the release of additional non-lethal equipment for Kyiv. On the flip side, this week will also provide reminders of the continued and very real challenge posed by populism and nationalists. India commemorates Martyrs’ Day on Monday on the 75th anniversary of the murder of Mahatma Gandhi. As writer Ramachandra Guha notes in his FT Weekend essay, veneration of the anti-colonial revolutionary has waned as Hindu nationalism has surged.  In the US, the figure of former president Donald Trump will loom large again as his adviser Peter Navarro is set to go on trial on Monday for his failure to comply with a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the January 6 2021 attack on the Capitol. In the UK it is yet another week of strikes, beginning on Monday with driving instructors at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency. The biggest day of action will come on Wednesday when schoolteachers, train drivers and university lecturers down tools while the TUC trades union body stages a Protect the Right to Strike Day in opposition to a contentious government bill to curb industrial action on essential services.

Economic data The rate-setting schedules have aligned again for the monetary policy committees of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.   The ECB is expected to stick with extra-large rate rises while the Fed downshifts, having signalled it would end its pace of 0.75 percentage point increases in December. The Bank of England is expected to push through a 0.5 percentage point increase, owing to the stubborn persistence of high inflation, strong wage growth and the unexpected resilience of the UK economy. Companies We are in the thick of earnings season and this week is peak Big Tech with quarterly figures from Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta and Spotify. It has been a sobering time for the sector, not least the admission that they massively over hired during the Zoom years of the pandemic.  Apple will be notable given that it is expected to break a 14-quarter growth streak in the lucrative December period owing to a shortage of high-end iPhones. A November outbreak of Covid-19 in the Zhengzhou factory (known locally as iPhone city) is to blame, creating a handset shortage of somewhere between 5mn and 10mn units.  At about $1,000 a pop, this works out at a $10bn hiccup, and is not good news for Apple given its handset war with Google. Revenue in this quarter in 2021 was a nudge under $124bn; forecasts are slightly lower for 2022 but the hit to net profit could be greater.

"Elon Musk and the end of cheap money","Plus, First Boston gets a second chance and a Spac billionaire buys AFC Bournemouth","Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent to your inbox every Tuesday to Friday. Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Musk on marketsThe tale of First BostonFoley buys Bournemouth Elon Musk becomes a Fed watcher During a post-crisis era of low interest rates, Elon Musk became the wealthiest person on earth by using opportunistic stock and convertible debt offerings to finance the rise of Tesla. When its shares soared, he turned Tesla into an ATM, borrowing billions against its stock to broaden his empire.  It’s fitting that Musk has now become Wall Street’s poster child for getting caught off-guard as surging interest rates this year put a halt to the era of cheap money. Musk impulsively agreed to buy Twitter for $44bn just as the tide turned and was unable to back out. Now he’s facing a steamroller from the Federal Reserve. This week, he used his new position as a social media mogul to prognosticate on central bank liquidity.  “At risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates,” Musk tweeted on December 13. Ray Dalio and Howard Marks could take tips in brevity from the billionaire. As he was tweeting, Musk was also selling Tesla stock. From Monday to Wednesday of this week, Musk sold more than $3.5bn of Tesla shares, the FT reported.   Elon Musk still owns $70bn worth of Tesla shares plus more in options © AP The cash should help Musk trim his sizeable debts just as rising rates make them increasingly burdensome. He’ll be able to retire billions of dollars in high-cost debt that was used to finance his Twitter takeover.   Banks led by Morgan Stanley haven’t been able to syndicate $12.7bn of debt they funded for the buyout. Musk could potentially repurchase Twitter’s costliest debt at a discount, saving himself hundreds of millions of dollars in annual interest costs in the process. Bankers and lawyers tell DD they’re ending the year with a heavy slate of Rote “liability management” transactions, the act of alleviating or even restructuring overburdensome debt loads. Musk is self-administering his own unwinding, but he may uncover a juicy trade browbeating Morgan Stanley, of which he’s a whale of a client. Margining Tesla stock to buy Twitter debt off its books would be a good arbitrage for Musk. Margin loans can be secured at about 250-to-350 basis points over Sofr, the floating interest rate benchmark, bankers told DD’s Eric Platt — a far better rate than Twitter’s current interest cost. Musk did well conserving Tesla’s cash on his road to riches. Now that his fortune is plunging, he appears aware that every penny counts. Resurrecting the ghost of Credit Suisse past  While cutting his teeth at First Boston in the 1980s, options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb did not take well to his first career evaluation. “I tore it to pieces in front of them,” he told New York Magazine.  Instead of getting fired, he later proceeded to make what he called “fuck you” money by shorting the market on Black Monday in 1987 — the day the Dow plunged by 22.6 per cent, the largest one-day percentage drop in the index’s history — before moving on to UBS. He wasn’t the only one at First Boston, the once celebrated investment bank taken over by Credit Suisse in 1988, to make a name for himself. The newly minted graduates Joe Perella and Bruce Wasserstein would become the biggest rainmakers on Wall Street. Laurence Fink, a talented First Boston mortgage bond trader, would also leave to start a little money manager called BlackRock. Adebayo Ogunlesi, First Boston’s former head of investment banking, went on to launch Global Infrastructure Partners. First Boston became a destination for top talent, including Adebayo Ogunlesi, who went on to be a co-founder of Global Infrastructure Partners © Catrina Genovese/WireImage/Getty Images The bank itself, though, didn’t age well. Caught in the highly lucrative but risky junk bond craze popularised at the time by Michael Milken’s Drexel Burnham Lambert, First Boston’s game of leveraged loan roulette left it with huge paper losses. By 2005, things had become so bad that Credit Suisse dropped the First Boston name altogether. For a while, working at First Boston carried a certain cache akin to Goldman or Morgan Stanley. As recently as this year, alumni would give their name and then say “First Boston” when answering the phone, a former Credit Suisse banker told DD’s Sujeet Indap and James Fontanella-Khan. Credit Suisse First Boston stock traders © Mark Peterson/Corbis via Getty Images But that prestige has since faded and become a distant memory. As has the reputation of Credit Suisse, for that matter, as DD readers will be painfully aware. Michael Klein, the ex-Citigroup dealmaker and former Credit Suisse board member who re-entered the spotlight as a face of the Spac boom, thinks he can resuscitate two birds with one stone. He has been tasked with restoring First Boston, the soon-to-be-spun-off advisory and corporate finance firm of which the Swiss lender hopes will solve many of its problems, to its former glory. The next incarnation of First Boston would do best to leave its proclivity for junk bonds in the past, especially as temptation looms large. Bill Foley: from Spac-man to Bournemouth fan The top end of English football is like catnip for big characters. Russian oligarchs, former prime ministers, royalty — they’ve all put skin in the game. All signs point to the fact that the latest club owners to join them won’t disappoint. Leading the £120mn acquisition of AFC Bournemouth, a team on the south coast of England, is Bill Foley.  The US Air Force and Wall Street veteran has been known to write blank cheques. He dabbled in the Spac boom, including his $600mn Spac with famed former Blackstone dealmaker Chinh Chu in 2018 and a blank-cheque deal with UK fintech group Paysafe in 2020. Now, the US billionaire — who also owns the Vegas Golden Knights ice hockey team — has turned his attention back to sport, teaming up with a consortium of investors that includes Hollywood star Michael B Jordan of the Black Panther and Creed cinematic universes. “Bill doesn’t do things by halves,” said Les Allan, managing director at Santa Monica-based investment bank Montminy, which advised the club and former owner Maxim Demin on the deal. That might be an understatement. Foley hopped on the radio this week to tell listeners that he’s “a dictator” who feels the “need to be the captain of the ship”.  Bill Foley © AP One of the most interesting aspects of Foley’s foray into English football is price. Bournemouth may be in the Premier League — the world’s richest domestic football division by revenues — but £120mn is a far lower entry point than what an investor would pay for a US sports franchise.  That’s partly because Europe’s football leagues include the possibility of relegation, or demotion to a lower division. That’s the punishment for poor sporting performance. It’s value destructive, if you couldn’t guess. Bournemouth — and former owner Demin — know the story all too well. This is the club’s first season back in the big time after two seasons in the Championship, the second-tier of English football.  Foley’s purchase was a bargain as far as football clubs are concerned. He’ll now need to focus on keeping it that way. Job moves Lloyds Banking Group has hired Ron van Kemenade, the tech boss of Dutch banking group ING, as its next chief operating officer. He will start in June.Swedish battery start-up Northvolt has named Jim Hagemann Snabe, the current chair of Siemens and former chief of software company SAP, as its next chair.Numis has made three hires at its Dublin office: Citi’s Peter Davis as director of investment banking, Davy’s Cian Fanning as a director of equity sales, and wealth manager Goodbody’s Rob Fallon as a director of equity sales trading.Fried Frank has named Andrew Rearick as a partner in its M&A and private equity practice, based in London.

That clunky phrase captures prices from bus rides to hospital stays and, in Powell’s opinion, holds the key to inflation’s path forward. He believes inflation in this category is driven by wages. The big inflation question, in other words, is whether the Fed can cool the labour market.  A conventional enough view, but it’s worth asking how labour market conditions drive this kind of inflation. We see at least three ways to look at it: Through business costs. Powell’s stated justification is that “wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services”. This story feels very intuitive. Services, by definition, involve someone serving you, and that person needs to be paid. Fed research often asserts the labour-intensity of services without further explanation (if the Fed has done a more detailed treatment somewhere, send it along!). If this account is right, the central bank must step in to stop a spiral of escalating costs and prices.Through labour-intensive business costs. A different version of the cost story, which accepts the premise that business costs link wages and inflation, but distinguishes between higher labour-intensity services (think restaurants) and lower-intensity ones (think airfares, heavily influenced by the cost of jet fuel). Strong wage growth lifts inflation but its influence is particular, not general. It’s not a big leap from here to concluding that if inflation in specific wage-sensitive segments are offset by deflation elsewhere, overall inflation looks less menacing.Through consumption. The argument is that high wage growth sustains above-trend consumer spending. This is keeping demand well above supply, resulting in inflation. We asked the FT’s Martin Wolf what he thinks and, ever the stalwart macroeconomist, he weighed in favour of 1 and 3. Strong wage growth raises consumption, letting companies pass higher wage costs on to unflinching consumers via price increases — a classic wage-price spiral. Martin nodded to the fact that wage cost pressure is more pronounced in labour-intensive sectors, but maintained that these wage pressures show up everywhere. Over at The Overshoot, Matt Klein argues persuasively for 3. We quoted his post earlier this month: Employment income is the largest and most reliable source of financing for consumer spending. Wages can rise 1-3 percentage points faster or slower than consumer prices for a variety of reasons — including but not limited to compositional and definitional differences — but larger gaps between the growth rates of wages and prices basically don’t exist outside of WWII and Korean war rationing, the late 1990s productivity boom, and the first year of the pandemic. His chart below sums it up. With rare exceptions, wage and price growth track one another:   Lastly, Alan Detmeister, a former Fed researcher now at UBS, made the case to us yesterday that 2 (and a bit of 3) is the best explanation. He points to how modest inflation looks in the long tail of services inflation, in contrast to much hotter inflation in labour-intensive services such as haircuts and laundry.  He shows this by taking Powell’s non-housing core services inflation and stripping out medical and transportation services. Broader services inflation does not look so much hotter than before the pandemic:  The exception, as you can see above, is the last data point: the striking uptick in this week’s November CPI report. But while a few labour-intensive services logged abnormally large price increases in November, so did services without an obvious wage link, such as mobile phone plans. Detmeister suspects a blip. The bottom line: In this period the highest inflation was in goods initially, then it moved to rents, now you’re seeing a little bit of strength in some of these other services, which could mean we’re starting to see some of that [wage] cost pass-through occur. Or it could just be noise . . . Is the slowing in goods and rents going to be enough to offset those still-strong inflation numbers in the [labour-intensive parts of] non-rent core services? The most recent two [CPI] reports were clear: it looks like the slowing in goods will be enough. Detmeister thinks the Fed is hammering the economy much too hard and was too eager to move interest rates into restrictive territory, given inflation that he figures will probably moderate on its own.  We’ve been sympathetic to Klein’s consumption account in the past. But the picture is not simple. Powell needs to better explain what he and the Fed believe about services and wages. The link is not self-evident. (Ethan Wu) Fin de siècle or just a cycle, revisited (with Howard Marks) Some months ago Unhedged posed this question: After this period of acute inflation ends, will we return to something like the pre-pandemic status quo? Or will the pandemic mark the end of a 40-year regime of low inflation which, while it was punctuated by crises, featured long steady stretches of high returns for both bonds and stocks? This issue remains very much up in the air, as far as Unhedged is concerned. Howard Marks of Oaktree, who has been all over the FT in recent months, has put himself in the “fin de siècle” camp in his latest memo to investors. Marks argues that we may be seeing the third investment sea change of his career. The first two were junk bonds entering investment mainstream, opening the way for the buyout wave and private equity, and Paul Volcker’s successful war on inflation, which ushered in four decades of falling rates.  The low rates era reached its apex in the decade before Covid, with ultra-low rates and quantitative easing sending returns flying — so high, in fact, that it was not clear how much higher they could go. The result was Marks’ “low-return world”.  Now, however, inflation has put an end to all that. Rates have risen and prices have fallen. He sums up the shift in this table:  “These changes may be long-lasting, or they may wear off over time. But in my view, we’re unlikely to quickly see the same optimism and ease that marked the post-GFC period,” he writes. The lack of ease pleases him. High-yield bonds that yielded 5 per cent a year ago yield 8 now, so “they’re likely to deliver equity-like returns, sourced from contractual cash flows on public securities”.  My own gut feeling — it’s really nothing more than that — is that the changes Marks documents in his memo will fade fast. In the next year or two, inflation will succumb, and we’ll be back to the slow-growth, low-inflation, high-valuation world of pre-2020. My argument in its entirety: why wouldn’t this happen? I asked Marks why the world will be different after inflation subsides. He was characteristically modest about predicting the future (“Oaktree’s investment philosophy doesn’t prohibit having opinions, just acting as if they’re right.”) But he offered up the following thought about the US central bank: Anything can revert to where it used to be, except I don’t think we are going back to zero on [policy] rates. I think the Fed got trapped at zero for a long time and they regretted it, and they won’t want to go back there again. I don’t think the Fed wants to be on a highly stimulative position on an ongoing basis, they want to be at neutral, which I believe is [currently] defined as 2.5 per cent.I think [Janet] Yellen was really a dove and wanted growth, and [Jay] Powell is more balanced. To routinely keep rates at zero is like waking up every morning and giving yourself a shot of adrenaline. You can’t live on adrenaline.   I’m not sure I agree with Marks here. Will the Fed emerge from the 2009-22 era less sure that very low rates over long periods is a safe strategy?  Certainly the Fed does not like being squeezed up against the zero lower bound, which leaves it dependent on quantitative eating, a tool it neither understands nor trusts. The hard question (as Unhedged’s friend Ed Al-Hussainy of Columbia Threadneedle emphasises) is whether the Fed really chooses near-zero rates — or is forced into them, instead. In an ageing, unequal, low growth, low productivity world, the natural rate of interest might just be really low, leaving the Fed with little room to manoeuvre.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Credit Suisse’s wealth management woesJohn Mack is BackOrpea’s debt crisis Credit Suisse’s risky business Credit Suisse has made quite a few rolls of the dice lately in a hasty effort to reverse years of scandals, a string of significant departures and underwhelming financial performance.  They include: spinning off its investment bank in a period of deep economic uncertainty and handing control of it to former Citigroup dealmaker Michael Klein, pawning off much of its highly profitable securitised products unit to Apollo Global Management to reduce its capital burdens, and raising billions from the Saudi National Bank, whose investment will make it the bank’s largest shareholder. All of these changes could reap rewards that make them worth the risk. The only problem is that clients aren’t buying in. On Wednesday, the Swiss lender forecast a SFr1.5bn ($1.6bn) pre-tax loss for the final quarter of the year as wealthy clients withdrew up to 10 per cent of assets since the start of October. It was its fourth profit warning since January. The pullback from wealthy clients is particularly painful because its wealth management unit was supposed to be part of its “new core”, according to the plan carved out by its new chief Ulrich “Uli the Knife” Körner.  The results did little to instil confidence among investors around its restructuring plan. Credit Suisse shares fell by more than 6 per cent, trading at their lowest level on record since 1975. “The massive net outflows in wealth management — Credit Suisse’s core business alongside the Swiss bank — are deeply concerning, even more so as they have not yet reversed,” said Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti.  Credit Suisse’s sweeping restructuring plan had begun to ruffle feathers even before the recent results. The deal with SNB, whose largest shareholder is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, was poorly received. “It’s very painful to give 10 per cent of the bank away for just SFr1.5bn,” one top-10 shareholder in the group told the FT last month, as the nickname “Credit Saudi” began to make the rounds in Zurich. Return of the Mack: ‘I don’t fucking care’ John Mack is back. The two-time Morgan Stanley boss, whose job cutting sprees earned him the nickname “Mack the Knife”, is out with a new memoir Up Close And All In.  In it, he recounts his journey as a second-generation Lebanese immigrant from Mooresville, North Carolina, to lead one of Wall Street’s biggest investment banks. It ends on the melancholic disclosure that he was recently diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which could be the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Some critics have poked fun at the memoir’s self-aggrandisement and a lack of reflection by Mack over his role in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Mack, now 78, was typically defiant: “I gotta be honest with you, I don’t fucking care, alright? You think I care?” he told the FT’s Josh Franklin and Brooke Masters. “If people think I have a big ego, I did have a big ego. I don’t care.” John Mack: ‘The culture of just making money is the wrong culture’ © Bloomberg Pressed on his role in the 2008 crisis when he was running Morgan Stanley — his bank was saved by a $9bn cash injection by MUFG and took $10bn in government bailout money — Mack blamed bad decisions on the competitive pressures at the time.  “After declining a lot of chances to put risk on the books, we came to the conclusion it’s time to step up and show that we are in business, we will take risk. At the end of the day, I would argue we got lucky and smart and it worked out,” he said. Regardless of the causes, Mack argued the industry has learned valuable lessons from the crisis.  “The culture of just making money is the wrong culture,” he said. “Maybe 25 years from now it’ll all dissipate and it’ll go back to, ‘Let’s take risk and make as much money as we can’. But I think boards are more inquisitive. I think risk committees are more robust.” FT readers sound off on the Orpea debt crisis Sometimes when your trusty FT reporters publish a story, something magic happens — the discussion in the comment section brings expertise and arguments that go way beyond what the story was able to delve into.  That’s what happened under Leila Abboud’s column on the travails of French nursing home group Orpea where FT readers debated the merits of the company’s efforts to restructure its €9.5bn debt pile.  Hate to say it, but the FT reader comments on my column on Orpea being a key test case for French debt restructurings are arguably better than the piece itselfhttps://t.co/2mDucY8edy pic.twitter.com/kHRBXUafPS— Leila Abboud (@labboudles) November 23, 2022

 On one side was a reader who slammed Orpea for doing an about-face from a June plan to cut debt by refinancing a bunch of loans and selling off real estate assets, only to opt in October for a more radical debt-to-equity swap that would effectively wipe out shareholders. On the other was a reader who thought that tack was the right one, even if very harsh on shareholders. A similar debate is also raging in Paris where a battalion of lawyers for the creditors and shareholders are seeking to influence the direction of Orpea’s ongoing debt restructuring talks. While all that crunchy detail didn’t fit in the column, FT readers took it to the next level in the comments.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday This week on the Working It podcast, we talk about political and social divisions at work. How can business leaders minimise discord so that all types of people can work well together in a polarised political climate?  Since the murder of George Floyd two and a half years ago, we’ve seen high-profile efforts by organisations to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. What we haven’t seen is much evidence that money spent on unconscious bias training, for example, actually works. As far back as 2017, McKinsey, the consultancy, estimated that $8bn a year was spent on this sort of training. My guest on the podcast is Octavius Black, CEO of Mindgym, a consultancy that uses behavioural science insights to change corporate culture. Octavius points out that forcing staff to undertake unconscious bias training is likely to backfire. Octavius Black of Mindgym joined us to record Working It at the FT office in London  It may be that less discussion of politics and more focus on disagreement about workplace issues — whether or not to launch a new product, for example — is the best way forward.   Next week we’ll kick off Working It’s first-ever mini-series, as Emma Jacobs investigates the UK’s four-day working week experiment. You’ll hear from bosses, workers and experts at companies taking part in an experiment which offers five days’ pay for four days’ work. Listen in — new episodes every day next week.

If you work in HR, you conduct employee engagement surveys. Getting concrete feedback is a non-negotiable before investing time and effort into deciding what most needs your attention. But for your own career — and life beyond it — how well do we truly know what other people expect of us? It’s a good idea to find out, especially if you’ve been feeling stretched thin. A lot of us “feel like we’re on a hamster wheel, but we’ve never really asked people what’s important,” says Christie Hunter Arscott, a career adviser and author of Begin Boldly: How Women Can Reimagine Risk, Embrace Uncertainty, and Launch A Brilliant Career. Instead of trying to balance everything that you think is expected of you, start by challenging your assumptions. Achieving work-life balance, while aspirational, is “an elusive idea”, Christie says.  Adapting the business practice of conducting stakeholder assessments for your own life and career is a concept pioneered by psychologist Stewart Friedman. Christie says this should be your first step in staving off burnout. One way to do this is to write your manager a weekly email about what you’ve been working on and what you have planned for the upcoming week. Ask them if anything is missing and if your work is aligned with their priorities. “This is a method of ensuring visibility, ensuring alignment on priorities, and you’re asking the question in a standard way,” says Christie. The concept can also be applied to life at home. For example, chat with your kids about what kind of quality time they want to have with you. If their priority is that you’re available on Saturdays, but they don’t care as much about nightly family dinners, then you can let yourself off the hook about rushing home every day. “When we invest based on assumption, that’s what causes tension in our lives,” says Christie.  Getting this type of clarity might lead you to realise you’ve been worrying about too much, and that you can scale back to focus only on what actually matters to the important people in your life. But it’s also possible that you’ll feel overwhelmed by others’ expectations of you. If that’s the case, Christie suggests determining the “need to haves” and “nice to haves”. Ask your boss what they want you to focus on first. If you’re still feeling stretched too thin after clarifying priorities, “then the question is about resourcing and delegating,” says Christie. Keep the conversation about priorities with your boss focused on work. “This isn’t the time to bring up your out-of-work commitments,” says Christie. Ideally, you’ve developed a relationship with your boss in which you’ve already shared with them what matters to you outside of work (and, if you’re a boss, encourage your employees to share that with you). Once you know exactly what other people actually care about and expect from you, the next step is to properly allocate your time toward those priorities. Christie suggests thinking about your hours of the day as dollars (or pounds, or your currency of choice).  “By intentionally investing based on data, you’re getting the highest return on investment,” she says. This mindset is a shift away from the concept of work-life balance. “Instead of ‘how do I balance?’ the question becomes ‘How do I optimise?’” says Christie. (Sophia Smith) A word from the Working It community:  The latest rounds of job cuts in tech could wound the sector for years to come, writes Brooke Masters — and they’ve also provided a case study in how not to fire people. FT readers share their own thoughts and battle wounds from dismissals past. Reader Nixer65 recalls their torturous tenure at an investment bank during the great recession, and points out that sometimes being let go in the first wave can be a blessing in disguise: I survived seven rounds of cuts in just under two years at UBS. I wish I had been let go in round one, when there were still jobs around and payouts were pretty good. People laid off in the seventh round hit a completely dry job market and the offers were considerably less generous. Those that survived had to keep the place together and in some ways got the rawest deal — no bonus, long hours and hanging on by a thread and nowhere to go. Reader Doutora connects the dots between various aspects of modern business, reminding us that job cuts are just one part of a larger picture:  The cruelty of these types of lay-offs has huge knock-on effects, not just for those made redundant, but their families and communities — not to mention the guilt of “survivors” who remain. But the type of short-termism that Masters describes as “a natural consequence of decades of cyclical hiring and firing that sapped any sense of institutional loyalty” is due to more than just cyclical hiring and declining loyalty, but also many CEOs’ obsession with shareholder returns over a more holistic sense of institutional wellbeing. This is exacerbated by sharp increases in income inequality, oversized executive compensation, and the rising financial insecurity of younger employees. People increasingly view work not as a collective endeavour, but a tournament in which everything is framed as a zero-sum game. No wonder employee wellbeing has hit a nadir. And, amid an uncertain market, reader Legal Tender focuses on what they can control: Regular corporate restructuring and cost-cutting is part of life in many industries. There’s a bullet with your name on it somewhere out there — the question is ‘when’. The key is to be prepared.Smart employees save a minimum six months expenses to survive lay-offs, network actively, are always in introductory conversations about new jobs and are brutally aware of their department’s strategic importance (or not) to the company. Most of all, be seen as likeable and productive internally. That may not spare one a redundancy, but that reputation makes finding a new job easier. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

"Can technology make your business more sustainable?","Emerging companies have made a difference in helping larger groups to measure, assess and devise plans to minimise their impact","Sustainable practices are now an imperative for everyone in business. Scientists have found that seven of the eight “earth system boundaries”, which include climate, biodiversity and natural ecosystems, are beyond their “safe and just” limits. Climate events are worsening with 2022 registering the hottest summer in Europe coupled with significant water shortages. Concern is growing over further drought this summer. In the US the Environmental Protection Agency says average temperatures in America have risen at a faster rate for the past three decades and that similar trends are observed worldwide.  The need for faster action is obvious. By 2050, CO₂ and other greenhouse gas emissions, if unchecked, will result in more than rising temperatures, widespread flooding and stranded assets.  Tech for Growth Forum💾 View and download the entire report Julian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge university, says: “Climate change is real. It is still being discussed as if it was a middle-class dinner party conversation but . . . on the trajectory we are on, maybe up to a billion people in poor countries near the equator will be unable to access sufficient food this century. It’s a much more urgent problem than anybody has appreciated yet.”   Economically, Swiss Re estimates that global gross domestic product could shrink by at least a tenth unless there is a concerted effort to keep the global warming threshold to well below 2C.  Companies must either take control of their actions or risk a public backlash when reality bites. System-wide change is needed to drive sustainable consumer and corporate behaviour — individual actions must include more cycling and walking; driving smaller, electric cars; minimising flying; being judicious with purchases; switching to heat pumps and avoiding red meat.  Although climate change dominates the headlines, sustainability is the wider topic that considers how humans affect the planet and its resources. It covers environmental issues arising from pollution, the use of natural resources (water, land, forests) as well as waste treatment. While the UN’s sustainable development goals extend to societal factors — such as equality and health, whose absence often lies behind poor stewardship of resources — this report will focus on the environmental effects of business activity.  Show me the money The avoidance of loss, either financial or of biodiversity, should be an incentive for more responsible corporate behaviour. It has been hard, however, to convince boards and investors of the need for action given the perceived lack of benefit. Even if companies do not wish to take action, consumers today demand more from who they buy from, and they prefer to deal with those that reflect their values.  Tangible rewards await those that act responsibly. Better management of resources can reduce costs and improve profitability through, for instance, more efficient use of energy or reduced business travel.  The top line can benefit, too, as the World Economic Forum highlighted in its white paper Winning in Green Markets. Its 2023 study, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group, said demand for green materials would probably outstrip supply. This will benefit those that take an early lead even if there is an initial extra cost, with consumers more willing to pay a green premium. The report observed a median price premium of 35 per cent for sustainably marketed products in consumer goods in the US in 2021. Over five years the compound annual growth rate of revenues was two and a half times that of conventionally marketed goods.  More critically, as consumer concern grows, reputation will make or break a company. A 2021 awareness study commissioned by Japanese advertising agency Dentsu Group and Microsoft Advertising found that within a year three in five respondents would shun brands that do not act on climate change while half would switch to greener alternatives. Companies such as Valve, creator of the Steam Deck gaming console, which taps into the desire for greater product repairability win plaudits from fans. Meanwhile, it remains to been seen what the impact will be of Apple’s strategy to enable its devices to be more easily repaired — but seemingly only by expensive Apple-accredited technicians.  The emphasis on values over brand will increase in importance as younger generations mature. A US consumer survey by First Insight and the Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in late 2021 said Generation Z, born between 1995 and 2010, cares more about sustainability than brand names than any other generation. Three-quarters of this group rank sustainability highly and only half consider brands when they buy products. The survey concluded that Gen Z’s stance has influenced those older than them. Across all generations, three-quarters of respondents expect retailers and brands to behave more sustainably.  In Europe a similarly high proportion of people feel “a personal responsibility to act to limit climate change”, according to a Eurobarmometer survey, while a majority believes that climate policies will create more jobs than they remove.  Regulation coming Even if they choose to ignore the headlines and disregard the consumer, companies’ choices will run out as governments step in to legislate. In the area of climate change alone, the WEF counted more than 1,100 new laws worldwide since the Paris Agreement in 2015.  The “right to repair” is one example. Popular movements have forced some US states to legislate over this so that all products are easily repairable rather than having to be sent to landfill. Such laws are planned elsewhere in America while the European Commission has adopted a similar proposal.  Regulation has taken hold in other areas, too. In 2015 the UK levied a charge for single-use plastic shopping bags and in 2020 it banned plastic straws and microbeads. A further ban on single-use plastics, including plates and cutlery, will come into force this autumn. Laws to improve reuse and recycling rates, which will be critical to reducing plastic waste in the oceans, are under discussion in both the EU and the UK. In the US, California, a global top-five economy in GDP terms, last year mandated that all packaging must be recyclable or compostable by 2032. Recognition of the problems caused by waste extends beyond that of the ecological disaster caused by discarded plastic. The European Commission estimates that the bloc’s citizens discard 6mn tonnes of textiles a year, only a quarter of which are recycled. EU member states now support a ban on the destruction of unsold clothing, so action may be imminent.  Investors onboard Investors are weighing in, too. A Dutch-led coalition of 185 investors, which oversees $10tn in assets, wrote in May to the world’s biggest grocery, retail and consumer goods companies to warn of the risks posed by continued use of plastics. Failure to act, the group says, will lead to financial risks including “regulatory risks arising from bans, taxation and extended producer responsibility costs, reputational risks, increased momentum in plastic-related litigation and increased raw material costs”. This follows investor action in 2022, when at least six companies including Amazon and McDonald’s faced shareholder petitions asking for greater disclosure of efforts to reduce plastic usage.  Meanwhile As You Sow, the non-profit shareholder advocacy group, began a petition in 2021 demanding that Microsoft investigates the benefits of making its products more repairable.   Corporate behaviour Of course there is a risk when companies claim sustainability credentials. The potential for greenwashing is a big concern. In June the UK advertising watchdog took action against Shell, Petronas and Repsol for advertisements that misled the public about the climate and their products. In October last year HSBC advertisements were banned for being selective with information.  Even as some industry leaders work together to find solutions through organisations such as Pace (the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy) some in the UK have resisted government efforts to make them more accountable for plastic recycling. The implementation of a bottle recycling scheme in England and Wales has been delayed until 2025.   It is not all bad news. WEF’s Alliance of Climate Leaders highlights member companies that work with their suppliers to improve sustainability, prioritising those with shared values. Unilever has emphasised nature-based solutions and aims to have a deforestation-free supply chain by the end of 2023 in business areas including palm oil and soy. Philips, the medical equipment maker, intends to generate a quarter of its revenues from circular products by 2025 and it has joined ASML, Dell, Enel and others to share best practices in the Capital Equipment Coalition.  Philips takes back its used equipment and refurbishes it, selling it with warranties to those who want to buy second-hand. Recycling, especially of heavy equipment and where possible of buildings, not only reduces emissions but also slows resource depletion. This may be easier for businesses that serve other businesses. Consumers only have to answer to themselves and some may not choose to pay more to meet their values.  HCLTech, the IT services and consulting company, says client requests now include sustainability considerations on several levels. Service solutions, from logistics optimisation to product engineering, have emissions reduction as a core objective. Packaging engineering, for example, now looks at the lifecycle from production to disposal or recycling. “We identify hotspots for sustainability and how we can use substitutes to improve sustainability and recyclability as an add-on to the underlying efficiency,” says Santhosh Jayaram, global head of sustainability at HCLTech. He adds that service companies also ask for help to establish their Scope 3 emissions, the pollution created by their clients. Financial companies might require APIs (application programming interfaces) to access third party data. This could be coupled with data analysis to assess the emissions of a mortgage portfolio.   Sustainability challenges and their solutions While some people call for mitigation over adaptation, others say that prevention is always better than cure. In most sectors mitigation — for instance through carbon capture or recycling — is less desirable than stopping pollution and waste at source. An example is the second-hand textile market. This may appear to be a good solution to a problem created in the first world but it comes with issues of its own, including 40 per cent of clothes sent for recycling being burnt, dumped or simply discarded.  By using renewables and alternative or biodegradable materials, companies can limit the need to deal with legacy waste and so prevent existing problems from becoming worse. Below, we outline some of the process and material technologies that aim to address the most severe sustainability challenges.  Energy and emissions Significant progress has been made with renewable energy in the past 10 years, helped by government subsidies to promote technologies such as solar and wind power. The sector is an example of what can be achieved but progress is still insufficient to meet climate targets. The IEA said in 2021 that no new unabated coal projects should be approved if the world was serious about reaching net zero emissions. China alone permitted two new plants a week in 2022, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Some people put their faith in carbon capture, biomass or hydrogen to solve the problem and so avert the need for widespread behavioural change. This seems too optimistic. Experts such as Allwood say new technologies cannot be deployed at the speed and scale needed to solve the problem on their own. For starters, he says, companies must halve their use of resources and source all electricity from non-emitting generation.  Absolute Zero, a report co-authored by Allwood, sets out how to achieve the UK’s emissions goals using existing technologies. He says new developments will be at best a bonus but he discounts CCS (carbon capture and storage) playing a major part. “We’ve been talking about it for 20 years and there isn’t any at significant scale,” he says. Prevention One often-overlooked area relevant to all modern companies is the energy used by data centres. These process everyday transactions from online banking to food deliveries to emails. They account for 1 to 1.5 per cent of global electricity use and 1 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, says the IEA.  Lenovo, the electronics company, says the most sustainable solution is also the most economical: reducing the power used by data servers will lower both costs and emissions. It points to its Neptune liquid cooling as a way to enhance data efficiency and also advocates timely updates to hardware. It says new servers can sometimes replace 10 to 20 old ones. To ensure that this is a sustainable option, companies must also efficiently dispose of used hardware (see e-waste, below).  Intel, the semiconductor maker, also stresses the importance of updating equipment. It claims its new data centre processor can reduce CO₂ emissions by 60 per cent while also lowering energy consumption.  There are some simple ways to tackle emissions. One easy win is to commit a company to using 100 per cent green electricity. Another is to reduce business flights. While aviation accounts for only 3.5 per cent of total emissions, relatively few people fly. Companies could do far more in this area and Travel Smart lists the businesses that are especially tardy. In terms of overall aviation emissions the tourism sector needs to address its contribution considering, for example, the volume of flights that take regular tourists to the countries and coastal areas that will be most affected by climate change. Transport-related CO₂ emissions of the tourism sector make up 22 per cent of emissions from all transport, says the UN World Tourism Organisation. Other major sources of climate-damaging emissions are cement and steel used in construction and heavy industry but alternatives are emerging.  SSAB of Sweden has developed a fossil-free “green steel” which Volvo has used to build heavy equipment. This material should be available commercially in 2026 but its energy use is still higher than for recycled steel. Allwood’s research group has come up with a tooling solution to make car bodies. “The car is almost a byproduct of scrap creation”, he says, pointing out that nearly half the steel used is wasted in the shaping process. Allwood’s method reduces the offcuts by three-quarters. On the cement side there is progress, too. This year Cement 2 Zero, a UK project led by the Materials Processing Institute, said it was ready to trial zero-emissions cement on an industrial scale. The method recycles concrete into a cement harder than Portland as part of the steel recycling process. Allwood, one of three Cambridge engineers behind the project, calls the solution “a miracle”.  More efficient building design can help and Allwood has contributed here, too, with software that can calculate optimal designs for materials usage. Buildings also add to emissions through their everyday operations. The IEA says that in 2021, the operation of buildings accounted for 30 per cent of global final energy consumption and 27 per cent of energy sector emissions. Tellingly, the energy demand for space cooling rose by more than 6 per cent year on year.  Designing a digital twin of a building in advance of construction can optimise both material use and its emissions profile. Sensors and energy monitoring help to cut consumption. A way to repurpose energy to power hot water systems is already available and this and other initiatives are showcased in the Schroders building in London.  Consumers can have a direct effect on energy usage beyond lobbying and choosing the best companies to buy from. Equiwatt helps households save money and reduce emissions with a monitoring app that advises them to switch off appliances and steers them away from drawing too much energy at peak times.  Plastics/packaging waste  In its 2022 report The Price of Plastic Pollution, the Minderoo Foundation estimated that the cost of dealing with plastics was equivalent to the total revenue of the plastics industry. It said corporate liabilities from litigation between 2022 and 2030 could exceed U$100bn. In 2020 Carbon Tracker put the global annual cost of plastics usage at $1,000 a tonne, which takes into account emissions, ocean pollution and waste collection. Some 40 per cent of plastic waste ends up in the environment.  Mitigation Most mitigation strategies depend on recycling but the OECD says this deals with less than one-tenth of plastic waste worldwide. Plastic consumption has quadrupled in 30 years. Twelve per cent of global oil supply is used to create plastics and this accounts for 3.4 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. While many governments now mandate levels of recycled content, the market has not caught up. It may still lack the incentive to do so: in the UK Planet Tracker says plastic-makers would rather pay a tax of £200 a tonne for missing the targets for recycled content than use recycled resin, which tends to be costly as demand is high relative to supply. Companies could standardise packaging materials if they put their branding on shrink wrapping, says Planet Tracker. This would allow fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies to buy recycled resin, the colour of which can be inconsistent, and print their identity on the outside of the container. While it would prove good intent on the part of makers, it can still be fiddly. It requires the consumer to separate the sleeve from the container, or the sleeve and container to be the same kind of resin.  Metaspectral, a Vancouver company, has a novel recycling sorting technology that is already in use. Other groups use AI to identify types of plastic but Metaspectral’s imaging process sorts items by the material composition seen in each pixel rather than by shape. Its neural network runs at high speed to process vast amounts of data. Its technology sees through transparent items to identify different materials in a stack of objects. It can differentiate between grades of the same material and sort multi-layered and black plastics. “It is hard to implement pure sorting because people put things in the wrong bins,” says Francis Doumet, chief executive of Metaspectral. “Our aim is to bring up the purity to make the recycled product more appealing to manufacturers of new packaging.”  Prevention While dealing with plastic in circulation is one problem, alternatives can ensure that the plastic mountain does not grow. New materials include packaging made of mushrooms, which is biodegradable or recyclable. Custom-made containers can be grown to shape in seven days and are compostable at home or will rot in the sea within 45 days. These cost a fraction of the price of foam moulding, according to Ecovative, the company behind the technology. Even with these qualities, it can be stored for 30 years and is flame resistant.  Mushrooms are not the only biodegradable option. Other companies such as Kelpi provide seaweed alternatives, while PhycoWorks, one of several biomanufacturing partner companies of UK Research and Innovation, a government body, combines AI with algae production. Origin by Ocean of Finland harvests harmful algal blooms and farmed seaweed to use as a chemical feedstock in place of fossil fuels.  Textiles Like plastics, textile waste is a problem. The impressive stock monitoring practices that enable fast-fashion producers to respond to demand thrive on a rapid replacement mentality. As Lex highlighted in December 2022, fashion brands produce twice as much clothing as they did 20 years ago and some 50bn items are estimated to be thrown away within one year of production. Textile waste per head has grown by 50 per cent over 60 years. While the supply chain is increasingly efficient, the returns chain is not as sophisticated — but managing returns is an important part of overcoming waste. Many retailers still find landfill the easiest and most economical solution. In 2022, according to the National Retail Federation, consumers returned $816bn worth of retail merchandise, a return rate of 16.6 per cent. This is almost twice the value of returned goods in 2020. Online apparel retailers fare worst, with a McKinsey survey finding that returns stood at about a quarter of sales. The survey found that reintegrating returns was not a high priority.  Prevention Companies that can manage the flood of returns — ideally by implementing a more accurate first-time sales process — can improve the sales to returns ratio.  Data collection is central to better outcomes. Gathering more statistics on the causes of returns can help companies learn about the customer and nudge them towards personalised recommendations. Better use of merchandising figures — looking at the flops of the previous season and understanding why these happened — can help to avoid product mistakes. Online pop-ups that query purchases of multiple sizes in the same cart, or an offer of advice on sizing, can pre-empt returns. Every online retailer should have a strategy in place to assess returns as a proportion of sales and tactics to deal with that. Augmented reality shopping tools may help but the efficiency of these is yet to be proved. Mitigation In Europe in 2020 textile consumption had the fourth highest environmental impact, with the third highest impact on water and land use and the fifth highest for raw materials usage and emissions. The European Environment Agency champions a circular approach to reducing textile waste, including designing for durability and repairability, recycling and reuse.  While addressing the waste issue before it happens is the ideal, biodegradable materials whose manufacture uses less water and has a lower carbon footprint will play a part.  Microfibre pollution, now found all over the planet, is largely caused by washing clothes made of synthetic fibres, which account for more than two-thirds of materials used in textiles. Tencel, a synthetic material mostly from eucalyptus, is biodegradable. Bamboo is also highly versatile, easily grown and absorbs carbon emissions. Bakong, found in south-east Asia, is the latest plant to show promise in fibre production.  E-waste  The Global E-Waste Monitor 2020 reported that nearly 54mn metric tonnes of electrical products were discarded in 2019, up by a fifth in five years. In part this is being addressed through the Right to Repair consumer movement which is persuading companies to design for longevity. Despite this the amount of waste is still forecast to reach 74mn tonnes by 2030.  Companies that wish to tackle the negative effects of their businesses, electronic or any other kind, should look at the procurement network devised by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. This sets out how to reduce waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use at the highest possible value and regenerate natural systems.  Despite greater awareness of the importance of circular principles, Right to Repair has yet to make headway on the disposal of commercial hardware. Huge data centres routinely scrap hard disc drives (HDDs) that could be repurposed and reused. This makes companies that use their services, for cloud storage for instance, indirectly responsible for a large volume of e-waste. The number of HDDs shredded every year could be 70mn, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It estimated that 60 per cent of scrapped drives could be reused, boosting economic value and creating far less CO₂ emissions than even the best recycling outcomes. Greater trust in the data-wiping process would improve reuse rates, says NREL. Companies working for sustainability With rising interest rates, those who conduct innovation and research face increased costs and financing scarcity. Despite this the sector still teems with companies pushing on all fronts of sustainability. TechNation says particularly active areas include energy, farming and food, the circular economy, mobility, the built environment, manufacturing, carbon accounting and GHG removal. Despite the poor record of carbon capture, start-ups such as CarbFix and Climeworks in Iceland hope to innovate to deal with emissions. New ideas are showcased by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Launched this spring, the foundation’s Circular Startup Index features 500 companies on a website that is searchable by industry, customer type and geography. One area where emerging companies have made a difference is in helping larger groups to measure, assess and devise plans to minimise their impact.  Monitoring and measurement are key Assessment of plans is critical to making progress on sustainability targets. Companies should have a sustainability owner at board level and key performance indicators that monitor outcomes against targets. Without building green data into KPIs it is hard to persuade employees to care. Swiss Re has a solution: when its executives travel, the company deducts an internal carbon price from divisional bonus pools. There are more universal approaches that aim to help companies assess their sustainability impact. The international Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, along with the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, provides frameworks to assess progress using a standardised approach. This makes it easier for investors as well as consumers to measure outcomes.  David Craig, co-chair of the TNFD, says nature is not a free resource and that only by putting a value on natural resources can we know the true cost of things. Carbon is measurable but so are the 34 biomes: the areas of land or water with distinct ecosystems. This helps companies understand where to focus their efforts. UBS, Kirin and Axa are among those that now use this system. Hank Paulson, the former US treasurer and chair of the Paulson Institute, also advocates for a valuation to be put on pollinators and healthy soils so that we can quantify the benefits of nature and better understand that they are not free.   Future trends Given the reputational significance, winning companies are likely to be those that manage their impact holistically, keeping a circular economy in mind from the moment a product is conceived. Better products will be those that can be repaired or as a last resort recycled. Companies that are responsive to these consumer demands will gain market share. Offering products that are disposable or that have built-in obsolescence is now unacceptable. While designing to enable repairs may not be profitable, governments and consumers demand it. Companies will have to accept this.  Above all, companies must keep in mind that addressing climate change can bring opportunities. If all homes are retrofitted for energy efficiency, for example, this could create a $50bn industry. The materials shortage alone will necessitate new methods of manufacturing and construction, presenting opportunities for those that can innovate. UK companies working in this area are backed by the Catapult Network, which accelerates research in areas from decarbonisation to biodiversity conservation.  Finally, the issue of product returns is likely to gain greater significance and publicity. Even if consumers expect returns to be facilitated, at some point the methods used — and the waste — will come back to bite. At present consumer choice and flexibility comes at the cost of piles of returned goods that are not resold. Like fast-fashion landfill, the issue of product returns — perhaps the most unrecognised impediment to sustainability — will need to be addressed if we are to achieve a truly circular economy.

"Hong Kong struggles to convince financiers it’s back open","Plus, Britishvolt’s anonymous benefactor is revealed and Apollo capitalises on the UK’s catastrophe","One scoop to start: The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, according to Elliott Management, one of the world’s biggest and most influential hedge funds. Elliott Management, founded by Paul Singer, pictured, laid much of the blame for the looming crisis on central bank policymakers, which it said had been ‘dishonest’ about the causes of high inflation © Misha Friedman/Bloomberg Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Hong Kong’s quasi comebackGlencore comes to Britishvolt’s rescueApollo cashes in on the gilts crisis Hong Kong’s anticlimactic reopening “We’re back!” Hong Kong’s financial secretary Paul Chan told a conference meant to celebrate the city’s triumphant return to business as usual.  But things weren’t as they appeared. After catching Covid-19 on a work trip, he was stranded in Saudi Arabia owing to Hong Kong’s remaining pandemic restrictions and appeared at the fintech gathering on Monday via video. It was a fitting emblem of the pandemic purgatory Hong Kong has found itself in since lifting restrictions such as weeks-long quarantines and flight bans that have stifled the city since Covid-19 first struck. Paul Chan, Hong Kong’s financial secretary, was forced to address Fintech Week attendees via video after catching coronavirus  © Bloomberg This week the city’s leaders planned a series of conferences to convince investors that Hong Kong is back open, after the quarantine sparked an exodus and drove its economy back into recession. The problem is Hong Kong hasn’t lifted all its restrictions: you still have to wear a mask and use a tracking app to get around. Visitors can’t go to restaurants and bars for the first three days and are subject to a week of PCR tests, forced to isolate for seven days if they test positive. But the city handed exemptions from many of these rules to attendees, only serving to highlight the restrictions were still in place. Chan ended up attending the events in person later in the week after being classified as a “recovered case”. Five top financial executives pulled out with limited notice. Blackstone’s Jonathan Gray and Citigroup chief Jane Fraser could no longer attend because of coronavirus infections, Barclays boss CS Venkatakrishnan “made changes to his travel plans”, while Capital Group chair Timothy Armour didn’t show due to Covid-like symptoms.   Executives told the FT that it was hard to convince their bosses to travel to Hong Kong, with the possibility of isolation still looming.  UBS chair Colm Kelleher speaking on Wednesday at a financial forum in Hong Kong, where growth has been stunted as a result of the city’s restrictive pandemic policies © AFP/Getty Images On stage the comments were fairly tame, but UBS chair Colm Kelleher raised eyebrows when he joked that “we’re not reading the American press, we actually buy the [China] story”. The comment came after a senior Chinese regulator said global investors had misread China’s intentions and should stop reading the international media.  All this comes after Xi Jinping’s power grab sparked a sharp sell-off of Chinese stocks, raising serious questions about the future direction of the world’s second-largest economy.  The mystery source behind Britishvolt’s 11th-hour bailout White knights come in all forms.  So Britishvolt, which on Monday morning was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, is likely feeling grateful for the emergency funding that will breathe another five weeks of life into the battery start-up.  It secured £5mn in assistance, giving it a window in which to find longer-term funding from either a strategic investor or a traditional backer, the FT’s Peter Campbell, Harry Dempsey and Michael O’Dwyer report. UK business secretary Grant Shapps © NEIL HALL/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The deal on Wednesday capped a tumultuous 48 hours for the business, which found out on Monday that Grant Shapps — who took over as the UK’s business secretary the previous Tuesday — had turned down its request for an advance on its £100mn government support.   As its cash reverses ran lower and lower, the Ferris wheel of ministerial positions in the past two months further complicated its efforts to flag the severity of the situation to whichever politician was in office. On top of that, at least one major would-be investor pulled support for the business, citing UK political turmoil.  Britishvolt’s initially unnamed short-term saviour requested anonymity as a condition of extending financing to the company.  It soon transpired, however, that the mystery benefactor was Glencore, which was having an otherwise busy day in a UK court, where prosecutors said its officials flew cash on private jets to bribe officials in Africa. The commodities giant was one of the first serious players to back the start-up in 2021. In addition to protecting its initial investment, Glencore could be trying to keep the company solvent enough to put together a longer-term deal to take control of the company. Britishvolt has assets worth protecting, including its world-class site at Blyth — which has already generated interest from other would-be owners — and its in-house technology, which was shipped to carmakers earlier in the year.  But the business needs £200mn to run until next summer — when it believes significant orders from carmakers will begin to land — and billions to realise its dream.  How Apollo cleaned up on the LDI crisis When there’s blood in the streets, Apollo Global is buying. It’s one of the takeaways of the recent pension fund crisis in the UK stemming from the disastrous “mini” Budget. UK pension funds, facing margin calls on derivatives linked to gilts, sold about $3bn of highly rated collateralised loan obligations — diversified pools of corporate loans — to quickly raise cash. Apollo was the major buyer. The US private equity group’s Athene annuities unit snapped up $1.1bn of assets during the fire sale, or about a third of the high-rated CLOs sold by the pension funds, DD’s Antoine Gara and Sujeet Indap and the FT’s Harriet Agnew and Josephine Cumbo report. Apollo chief executive Marc Rowan © Bloomberg “[They] happened to be the most liquid asset that those entities had to liquidate in order to cover their leverage and margin issues,” said Scott Kleinman, co-president of Apollo, on an earnings call.  The FT has covered the technicalities of the pension crisis in the UK, including a detailed look at the outsized exposures some lenders like Lloyds Banking Group had.  But the ability to capitalise on the situation has come from an under-appreciated part of Apollo, the $523bn in assets investment giant. Athene, which manages annuities on behalf of retirement policyholders, has become one of the engines of growth inside of Apollo, best known on Wall Street for its mega-sized corporate buyouts.  The unit, which took in $13bn in new assets last quarter, has a lower return hurdle than most of Apollo’s other strategies, making it a good home for high-rated assets put up for sale during a cash crunch. The effective yield on the CLO tranches Apollo bought was 8 per cent, too low for opportunistic debt investors, according to sources who spoke to the FT, but a coup for Athene’s policyholders. Chief executive Marc Rowan indicated that as the era of low rates, rising leverage and upward markets now unwinds, more cracks will appear that cause more fire sales of assets to be consumed by Athene. The LDI crisis was “the first, I believe, of many market hiccups”, Rowan said. Job moves Exor, the holding company controlled by Italy’s billionaire Agnelli family, has promoted Suzanne Heywood to chief operating officer and named Enrico Vellano as chief executive of its alternative investment platform Lingotto. It also named Heineken executive Guido De Boer as chief financial officer, succeeding Vellano.Chicago private equity firm GTCR has promoted Luke Marker, Stephen Master, and KJ McConnell from managing director to principal. The firm also hired Ashwin Krishnan as a principal from Advent International.Ares Management has hired Mark Serocold as a partner and head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa for its wealth management solutions platform, based in London. He was previously a managing director at Blackstone.

"Financial instability: the hunt for the next market fracture","Investors are keeping a close eye on areas ranging from US Treasury market illiquidity to Japanese government debt","After a decade of falling interest rates and central bank largesse, global financial markets are facing a reckoning. Soaring inflation is being met by rising interest rates, the slowing of central bank asset purchases and fiscal shocks, all of which are sucking liquidity, the ability to transact without dramatically moving prices, out of markets. Violent, sudden price moves in one market can provoke a vicious loop of margin calls and forced sales of other assets, with unpredictable results.  “The market is so illiquid and so erratic and so volatile,” Elaine Stokes, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, said. “It’s trading on every impulse and we can’t keep doing that.” Policymakers are paying close attention to market plumbing and financial stability risks, with the vice-chair of the Federal Reserve last month warning a “shock could lead to the amplification of vulnerabilities”. Disparate shocks — like the closure of the nickel market in London, structured product blow-ups, the bailout of European energy providers or the rapid pensions crisis in the UK sparked by turmoil in the country’s government debt prices — are being scrutinised as oracles of wider dislocations to come. With risks rising, investors are watching some bits of the market more closely than others. Eric Platt  European repo markets A rapid shift to higher interest rates is fuelling dysfunction in Europe’s money markets, threatening to undermine efforts to tighten monetary policy. The legacy of large-scale asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, in the eurozone and the UK is a flood of liquidity in the form of central bank reserves that were created to buy government bonds. Those bonds were hoovered up by the European Central Bank and Bank of England, leaving relatively few available to investors.  That scarcity of safe short-term debt may be hurting the euro area’s €10tn repo market, the International Capital Market Association, which represents the biggest players in global bond markets, warned earlier this year. The little-followed repo market serves as a vital lubricant in daily trading, as it allows investors to take out a short-term cash loan against the assets they hold. ICMA argued the shortage was distorting interest rates for prized collateral like short-term government debt, and pushing it well below the ECB’s deposit rate, which rose to 1.5 per cent last month having risen above zero in September for the first time in more than a decade. A similar dynamic has gripped UK markets, where, at the start of November, an index of overnight repo markets fell below the Bank of England’s policy rate by a record amount, according to analysts at ING. These distortions typically worsen at quarter and year-end. ICMA urged the European Central Bank to set up a reverse repo facility similar to the one introduced by the US Federal Reserve in 2013. That would allow the central bank to ease the collateral squeeze by loaning out some of the bonds it holds from its extensive asset purchasing programmes. The call came despite a move by Germany’s debt agency in October to address the scarcity problem by creating more government debt securities that it can lend out to investors in repo markets.  “Central banks are effectively conducting a bit of an unprecedented experiment by hiking rates when liquidity in the system is at such high levels,” said Antoine Bouvet, an interest rates strategist at ING. Tommy Stubbington  US Treasury market illiquidity Liquidity has long been the hallmark of the US Treasury market. But it has dried up as the Federal Reserve has ratcheted interest rates higher, and as major holders of Treasury debt such as the Fed and the Bank of Japan have stepped back. The disruption in liquidity has led some investors to question the overall health of the market. Any crisis in the Treasury market would have far-reaching consequences, because Treasury yields determine everything from mortgage rates to the cost for the US government to borrow. It is the backbone of the global financial system and the benchmark for all other US assets, so large swings in price would ricochet across markets. On top of the uncertainty and volatility in the market this year that has made Treasuries harder to trade, wary investors also argue that the liquidity issues are the result of longstanding structural problems. Some have always existed, but have been accentuated as the Treasury market has grown in size. And some have emerged as regulations following the 2007-09 financial crisis — which forced banks to have larger capital cushions — have made it more expensive for them to hold Treasury debt. Since then, those banks, traditional providers of liquidity, have retreated from the market. This means that in the event of a crisis, structural problems may exacerbate any sell-off, as was seen in March 2020. But the current liquidity issues in the Treasury market also mean it may not take an event as disruptive as the onset of a global pandemic to spark a big sell-off. If some mis-step prompted a dash for cash, investors could have trouble selling Treasuries, leading to huge swings in prices, producing big enough gaps in prices to lead to forced selling. Kate Duguid  Dysfunction in Japanese government debt For several months now, as the Bank of Japan has been forced to work ever harder to hold interest rates on the benchmark 10-year bond close to zero under its “yield curve control” policy, speculation has mounted on whether markets would ultimately force the central bank’s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, to back down and loosen the policy.  Japanese rates analysts and BoJ watchers tend to think he will not; foreign funds and traders believe that he might. Logically, say analysts, the BoJ will be exceptionally cautious about an exit from yield curve control, because of the potential for a disorderly exit to send shockwaves around the world.  High in the memory of Japanese central bankers is the 2015 experience of the Swiss National Bank, which suddenly lifted its ceiling on the franc, resulting in a huge effect on global markets.  Switzerland, compared to Japan, is small and the disruption that would be caused by a similar capitulation would be massive. Domestic stocks would plunge, with the ripple effect from a Japanese equity crash turning global funds into forced sellers. Deutsche Bank economist Kentaro Koyama noted that in the minutes of the BoJ’s September monetary policy meeting, one board member had spoken up about the increasing dysfunction of the bond markets.  “We consider it an important step towards a recognition among board members of the flailing functionality of the markets,” said Koyama. Leo Lewis  Stuck in credit For years, corporate bond and loan investors warned about the dangers of exchange traded funds in a crisis, raising concerns over how the popular vehicles would cope with large redemptions in a sell-off. But now, as the size of both the private credit and leveraged loan markets have exploded over the past few years, ETFs are seen a less of a menace. Instead, focus has shifted to mutual funds and other vehicles that have been hoovering up the recent surge of risky debt. The Fed and IMF have both rung the alarm bell over the issue. In a worst-case scenario, a fund suffering large outflows as bond or loan prices fall will have to halt redemptions, trapping capital and potentially leading to an unwinding of the fund. Investors nervous about a potential issue will probably head for the exit early, making things worse for those who wait behind. The fact that spillovers were seen in high-grade parts of the US credit market when pension funds in the UK were hit with margin calls has intensified concerns, given so many investors have piled into illiquid bonds and loans. The rise of private credit has also opened the door to new issues, with policymakers and regulators warning they have little insight into the cottage industry. These debts are traded far less frequently — if at all — and are not marked consistently by creditors. Even with the debt sitting in funds that require longer capital commitments, it is unclear how endowments and pensions might try to sell their stakes in a crisis. The secondary market is still nascent, albeit growing. “We will see a breakdown in private markets,” Stokes at Loomis Sayles added. “Every pension and endowment has shifted into [them].” Eric Platt  Emerging market defaults Two risks threaten financial stability for emerging market investors.  The immediate fear is of multiple defaults among low and middle-income countries as high interest rates and the strong dollar make it harder to service dollar debts. Credit rating agencies say 26 developing countries, about a third of those with sovereign eurobonds, are at substantial risk of default, extremely speculative, or in default.  Even so, the exposure of investors is less concerning. The 15 countries with bonds trading at distressed levels in October made up just 6.7 per cent of the benchmark JPMorgan EMBI sovereign eurobond index. But investors have become unwilling to fund governments of some larger emerging economies. Yields on the domestic 10-year bonds of Poland, Colombia and South Africa recently hit 20-year highs. They and other issuers are being hit by soaring inflation or big fiscal imbalances, or both. Investors worry that economies will not grow quickly enough for governments to stop debt ratios rising out of control.  Poland’s yields peaked at 9 per cent in October. Its ratio of government debt to gross domestic product is about 55 per cent. That looks unproblematic next to Brazil, where comparable yields are 12 per cent and government debt to GDP is close to 90 per cent. Yet Brazil’s yields have been broadly stable for the past 15 years. Investors are shunning Poland because its debt is of short maturity, about four years on average. But nerves about the landing point of inflation and interest rates, assuming they fall from their current highs, could quickly spread. “There is no magic threshold at which [such debts] become problematic,” said Manik Narain, emerging market strategist at UBS. “But they force austerity on governments and can lead to capital flight.” Jonathan Wheatley  Fractured markets: the big threats to the financial system","05.12.2022"
"Investors’ Chronicle: Liontrust, Cranswick, Virgin Money","Companies analysis from our sister publication","BUY: Liontrust Asset Management (LIO) ESG investing has been under the spotlight over the past 12 months but investors still seem interested in the strategy, writes Julian Hofmann. The past year has not been a happy experience for many asset managers as investors have pulled funds in the face of market declines. However, Liontrust Asset Management seems to have swerved the worst of the market downturn, despite net outflows of £2.2bn for the half. The company, along with the rest of the sector, seems to have reconciled itself with the market volatility that has characterised the year so far. A decrease in assets under management and administration of 5.5 per cent to £31.7bn illustrated the core of the problem, but there were some signs of improvement.    Difficult market conditions were a factor in impairments, with more than £12mn knocked off the value of two of Liontrust’s acquisitions. Some £4mn of this related to Majedie Asset Management, which Liontrust acquired for £80mn earlier this year. Unforeseen outflows at Majedie meant its goodwill valuation had to be reassessed. It was a similar story at Architas, which incurred a charge of £8.8mn. Broker Numis said the impairment at Majedie was particularly disappointing given that the deal completed only six months ago. However, it noted that November had seen a modest improvement in inflows: “Clearly, this is a very short time period and too early to extrapolate anything, but nonetheless a welcome respite from the significant net outflows seen this year,” the broker said. Our analysis that Liontrust’s shares were oversold earlier this year turned out to be correct and the company has remained resilient in difficult market conditions. The forward price/earnings ratio of 10 times Numis’s earnings forecasts for 2023 still represents a significant discount to its long-term average. Throw in a decent dividend yield and the basic case remains intact. BUY: Cranswick (CWK) Increasing Chinese swine prices are something to watch in the second half, according to analysts, writes Christopher Akers. It’s a tough meat market out there. The sector has been dealing with, among other things, labour shortages, soaring feed prices and a challenging avian influenza season. In this context, the chunky sales growth posted across divisions by pork and poultry supplier Cranswick was a good result, as indicated by the 4 per cent mark-up in the shares on results day. But higher costs led to an 88 basis point contraction in the adjusted operating margin, with profits hit by a timing lag in cost recovery and a £3.1mn charge stemming from a product recall and site closure at the company’s cooked poultry facility in Hull. Recovering costs is essential in this inflationary environment — the company noted that the UK standard pig price jumped from 147p per kg at the beginning of 2022 to 200p per kg at the end of September. The passing through of cost inflation via higher prices drove the revenue uplift, with customer growth and the introduction of new products also helping matters. Convenience sales grew by 13 per cent, fresh pork sales by 6 per cent, gourmet product sales by 20 per cent, and poultry sales by 8 per cent. With like-for-like volumes consistent with last year despite consumer demand pressures, this was a solid top-line performance.  Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and Brexit, Cranswick also made encouraging noises on its supply chain, saying that “labour constraints seen in the prior year have eased with ongoing investment in our skilled labour pool” (the company has turned to the Philippines for a supply of skilled butchers). It also noted that it is now 40 per cent self-sufficient on the pig farming side of the business after buying a further pig herd, which is no bad thing in this volatile market. Peel Hunt analysts cut their adjusted pre-tax profit forecast for the company’s 2023 financial year by 2 per cent on the back of these results, but pointed to higher Chinese pig prices as a profit booster, arguing that “ongoing price improvements will make a material difference to profits in [the second half] and help to mitigate the tough environment in the UK”. Cranswick’s shares trade at 15 times the broker’s 2023 earnings forecast, below their five-year average of 19 times per the FactSet consensus. And an improved cash position and increase in the dividend also support the bull case. HOLD: Virgin Money (VMUK) The financial services group bumped up shareholder returns as lending balances returned to growth, writes Mark Robinson. Virgin Money’s statutory profits have been boosted by a combination of rising interest rates and a lower level of impairments. The net interest margin, the difference between loan and savings rates, increased by 23 basis points to 1.85 per cent. Management expects the net interest margin to rise again, pitched at 185-190 basis points for full-year 2023. The deteriorating circumstances bedevilling the UK economy has yet to impact performance. But management remains cautious over prospects, even though it notes that “credit quality remains robust with low and stable arrears; provision coverage of 62-basis points above pre-pandemic levels”. Overall lending balances returned to growth, finishing up 1 per cent at £72.6bn, as the group continues to improve the mix of its deposit base, evidenced by a 13 per cent increase in relationship deposits. Operating costs edged up slightly through the year, but inflationary pressures could weigh more heavily on the group’s clientele as the year progresses.   Chief executive David Duffy noted “the potential affordability issues that higher living costs will cause for households and [Virgin] is ready to continue to support customers, as was the case throughout the pandemic”. At least many of the previsions taken against Covid-19 have been unwound. The CET1 capital of the institution as a percentage of its total risk-weighted assets increased by 10-basis points to 15 per cent and management highlighted the “strong outcomes” from Virgin’s inaugural participation in the Bank of England’s stress testing regime. On the balance of risks, management felt justified in awarding shareholders with a final dividend of 7.5p per share, together with a £50mn extension to the £75mn share buyback announced in June. However, we remain circumspect given wider macroeconomic challenges. Hermione Taylor: Should the 2 per cent inflation target be ditched? Will inflation ever drop back? The Bank of England thinks so. It forecasts a rapid retreat, with inflation returning to the 2 per cent target by the second quarter of 2024. But there is another argument: thanks to reduced globalisation, elevated inflation expectations and changing energy supplies, inflation might become “structurally” (and permanently) higher.  UBS analysts addressed this in a recent briefing, but remain sceptical. They argue that “we believe the inflation trend over five to 10 years is largely controlled by the central bank” meaning that inflation can remain elevated “if, and only if, central banks allow it to move higher”. Given the steely rhetoric of central banks over the past few weeks, this seems unlikely. The BoE says it is prepared to “respond forcefully” to inflation. The Federal Reserve has made similar statements.   But here’s a radical idea — what if they stopped trying?  As the BoE sets out, the desirability of “low and stable inflation” is well established, but a 2 per cent target is relatively arbitrary. Today’s experience reminds us that high inflation is painful: squeezing real incomes and fuelling fears of a wage-price spiral. But very low inflation is also a problem — it risks tipping into deflation, increasing the real value of debts and encouraging people to delay consumption.  A bit of inflation also helps central banks to avoid the ‘zero lower bound’ of interest rates. If interest rates are at zero but the economy is underperforming, traditional monetary policy is stymied: the central bank can’t provide any further stimulus by cutting rates. If policymakers aim for a higher inflation rate, they can set higher nominal interest rates whilst keeping the same “real rate”. The higher the inflation rate, the more scope central banks have to cut.  This might seem a rather hypothetical problem. Yet if forecasts are correct, the UK could find itself mired in a low growth and low inflation (see chart) environment relatively soon. A higher inflation target would mean more monetary policy “firepower” if the economy stagnates. This was the argument made by economist Olivier Blanchard and colleagues in a 2010 IMF paper, which raised another important question: why have a 2 per cent target at all? Are the net costs of inflation really any higher at 4 per cent?  This question has consequences for our immediate economic position, too. The BoE’s Huw Pill recently warned that the economy would not face an “immaculate disinflation”, and that returning to target would mean a weaker economy. The Bank expects unemployment to rise to 6.4 per cent by 2024, and for the UK to enter the longest recession in a century. Does pursuing a 2 per cent target mean economic pain for minimal gain?  Howard Davies, former chair of the Financial Services Authority, argued in August that raising the UK’s inflation target “might give policymakers a little more flexibility, and bring about a more stable monetary-policy regime in the longer term”. But he also highlighted a significant problem — raising the inflation target as price increases are running hot is risky. After all, it could untether inflation expectations.  The Bank’s fragile credibility would also be damaged if the move to a higher target gave the impression of giving up the fight against inflation. It would be particularly vulnerable if it moved first among the club of economies with a 2 per cent target, especially the eurozone and the USA.  Given central bankers’ tough talk, it is hard to imagine any of them settling for anything less (well, more) than target. Yet inflation is forecast to drop swiftly and dramatically. Once it is on a downward path, the dialogue will be free to pivot away from the battle against inflation and towards the monetary policy of the future. A higher target could become an increasingly attractive prospect.  Hermione Taylor is an economics reporter for Investors’ Chronicle ","25.11.2022"
"Franklin Templeton: an old-school stockpicker tries to reinvent itself","The fourth member of the Johnson family to run the group is pushing quickly into new asset classes and technology","Jenny Johnson was at the movies with her kids when her phone rang. She stepped into a theatre lobby smelling like popcorn to answer the $4.5bn call. “What’s your final number,” said Nelson Peltz. The activist investor had a 10 per cent stake in Legg Mason, the asset manager that Johnson’s family firm Franklin Templeton was trying to acquire, and Peltz was pushing for a higher price. But the Johnsons were prepared to walk away. “He needed to know that we were done,” Johnson says. She told Peltz to take their final offer to the board and went back into the movie. Legg Mason accepted the deal terms.  The $6.5bn acquisition, including Legg Mason’s $2bn of debt, was the biggest deal in Franklin’s 75-year history and remains one of the largest in the industry’s history.  The company announced the all-cash deal in February 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic shut down swaths of the global economy and sent financial markets into a tailspin, and Franklin was accused by some of paying too much. But Johnson, who had only just succeeded her elder brother Greg to become Franklin’s first female chief executive, is unrepentant. “We never looked back,” she says of the most high-profile component of a plan to stem outflows and reposition the company for a world increasingly dominated by huge managers peddling index-tracking products.  By the time of the Legg Mason deal, Franklin risked being overrun by seismic changes in its industry. Amid the wave of money going into low-cost index products and computer-driven trading strategies, the family-owned company specialised in offering more expensive funds run by managers who pick stocks and bonds.  However, conditions in markets have now started to shift. After more than a decade when bond-buying by the Federal Reserve and other central banks lifted all boats, rising rates are leading to more volatility, which could provide fruitful opportunities for active management. Some see it as a last chance for many stockpicking funds to prove their worth.  Johnson’s acquisition of Legg Mason and other businesses is a test of two propositions — that Franklin can diversify its operations enough to compete with rivals across a range of different products and that a family-run firm can still prosper in an industry dominated by behemoths such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which together have tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management.  Needing to catch up In 2020, Johnson had taken the reins of a business regarded as outdated and stodgy. When Franklin did an external survey in 2020 to gauge investor perceptions of its brand, one of the leading responses was “old fashioned”.   The California-based firm “was a perfect representation of the way the [fund management] business used to be”, says Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS. “They sold high-cost products that weren’t selling anymore and had very much not adjusted their approach to marketing or positioning.” “Franklin was only hanging in because it had a huge global franchise,” said Alex Blostein, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.  We had one fund topping sales every place in the world, knowing that was going to reverse at some point and was not sustainable Foremost among those products was the Templeton Global Bond fund, run by star fund manager Michael Hasenstab. In 2014, the bond fund’s global assets hit $111bn thanks to his daring bets on countries such as Hungary and Ireland and represented nearly 12 per cent of Franklin’s total assets under management. Greg Johnson, now executive chair, says the concentration risk and size of the funds were long-held concerns within Franklin. The bond fund had grown exponentially from “nothing”, he says. “We had one fund topping sales every place in the world, knowing that was going to reverse at some point and was not sustainable.” The fund’s popularity with investors had pushed Franklin’s growth at a clip that masked the upheaval in the broader industry, where similar midsized peers were being hammered by the rise of passive investment specialists.  From 2014, the Global Bond fund’s performance fizzled, and investors rushed to pull money out. Ill-timed bets on Argentina and US government bonds led to further outflows. Franklin’s share price halved over the subsequent six years, significantly underperforming other asset managers. The version of the bond fund available to US investors has seen its assets under management decline from a peak of $72.6bn in 2014 to $5.7bn.   The performance of its flagship was not Franklin’s only problem. Its business was also largely aimed at price-sensitive individual investors with small sums to invest, rather than institutions whose much larger mandates tend to be less mobile — something the Legg Mason purchase would change.   It was also dominated by actively managed funds, where a manager oversees investments with a view to beating a benchmark index over time, just as investor money was flooding into passive products, which merely aim to mirror the performance of a benchmark and have much lower running costs.  That seemingly unstoppable trend is reflected in the swelling size of the leading passive providers. After buying Bahamian asset manager Templeton in 1992, Franklin was a similar size to Vanguard Group, the third largest investment provider in the US, with nearly $90bn in assets. Three decades later, passive specialist Vanguard has over $7.2tn in customer assets, six times the size of Franklin. “2014 was our most profitable year ever, but it was also a tough lesson in the need for a resilient company to be diversified,” Jenny Johnson says.  Hawken picked up criticism of the approach of the firm’s leadership. “The story was, you’d spend 10 minutes on business and 30 on hockey in a 40-minute meeting,” he says. The investment manager slipped from being one of the top players in the US market to merely being in the top 10, and then the top 20.  The family firm Franklin is also unusual in that it is a public company with a $14.7bn market value but a high degree of family control — it has never been run by an outsider.  The company began as Franklin, a Wall Street brokerage founded by Rupert Johnson Sr in 1947 and named in honour of founding father Benjamin Franklin. It made its name with conservatively managed mutual funds, still a relatively new product in postwar America. The family still owns 42 per cent of the stock — a stake currently valued at $6.3bn — and dominates the top jobs. In addition to Greg, her uncle Rupert Jr is vice-chair.  None of Jenny Johnson’s own children work in the business, but two of her nephews do. She says “they’ll have to prove themselves” just like any other employee. Chief executive Jenny Johnson’s direct communication style at Franklin has discouraged a culture of politely agreeing with the family. She says it is important ‘that I have a management team that doesn’t shy away from that and, you know, will stand up. I like a debate’ © Luis Antonio Rojas/Bloomberg Her father Charlie ran the company from 1957 to 2005 and although he is no longer involved in an official capacity, Jenny Johnson says he will still “circle a footnote and make a comment and send it to me”. The dominance of the family has led some to question whether a non-Johnson will ever lead the business and what impact that has on the recruitment of top talent.  Matthew Nicholls, a British former investment banker appointed chief financial officer in early 2019, is a one of the few senior executives “who isn’t a member of the family, born into it or married,” says Hawken. “He’s the only outsider who is a part of the inside circle.” Analysts say Nicholls is credited with halting share buybacks, which Franklin was using to support its stock, and deploying the cash for acquisitions instead.  Putting cash to work Perhaps because of her forebears’ conservatism, Jenny Johnson says, one thing Franklin did have was spare cash. Ahead of the Legg Mason deal, it had piled up more than $8.2bn. When she became chief operating officer in 2016, she began to play a more direct role in long-term planning. The board realised it needed to move quickly into so-called alternative investments, such as real estate and private credit, and new technology, as well as enlarging its assets under management in order to compete.  “The story started to change,” says Blostein. Once known for its caution, Franklin became one of the boldest acquirers in the industry.  Before buying Legg Mason in 2020, it picked up Benefit Street Partners, a $26bn alternative credit investment firm for $683mn. After Jenny Johnson became chief executive, it added digital wealth advisory AdvisorEngine, indexing provider O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, manager of alternative assets Lexington Partners and private credit and debt specialist Alcentra. The firm’s assets under management grew from $717bn in 2018 to almost $1.4tn by the end of 2022.  “Those were all significant decisions that got made very quickly,” says David Manlowe, senior managing director of Benefit Street Partners.  Most of them were in alternative assets, which appeal to higher-net worth clients and deliver a specialisation that passive providers cannot offer. They also carry higher fees. Manlowe says the company “has gone from being not really a player in alternatives to now having north of $260bn in alts. It puts us in the top 10 in the alts space.”  Across the industry, however, such products are still relatively new, have yet to achieve widescale adoption and are still cumbersome to bring to clients. “Alternatives, candidly, have not been positive for investors,” says Kunal Kapoor, chief executive of fund analytics group Morningstar. “There has been a lot of talk about more offerings . . . So far, we have not seen significant successes.” Some critics complain that Franklin is acquiring a scattershot range of new companies, and overpaying for them. But others say it’s a strategy on its own. “Jenny by nature is someone who is willing to tinker a little bit,” Kapoor says. “She is willing to fail while trying a few different things.” Franklin under Jenny Johnson Asset managers tend to be wary of acquisitions, given the effect a badly executed one can have on a firm’s reputation. Integrating acquired companies is a slow and delicate process because of the fragile cultures of different investment teams.  “It’s easy to buy things; it takes 10 years to see if it’s a good fit,” Greg Johnson says. “Templeton we bought in 1992, and we’re still working on the merger.”  When you’re number six of seven kids, you’re just trying to be heard In a company where numerous executives boast multiple decades at the firm, the pace of change has also unsettled some. “When you take two $750bn [in assets] firms and put them together, that is going to require a certain amount of realignment,” says Terrence Murphy, head of public markets at Franklin and chief executive of ClearBridge. “The ones that didn’t adapt are no longer with the firm.” Those that remain say Jenny Johnson’s direct communication style has encouraged debate rather than a culture of polite agreement with the family. She says it is important “that I have a management team that doesn’t shy away from that and, you know, will stand up. I like a debate”. She adds: “When you’re number six of seven kids, you’re just trying to be heard.” Franklin is more diversified than it was 10 years ago. But communication with clients can be a challenge given the proliferation of views within the group. “People ask, ‘What is your view on inflation?’,” says Adam Spector, managing partner of Brandywine and head of global distribution for Franklin. “Well, Brandywine has a view. Western [another Franklin affiliate] has a view. Franklin has a view. ‘We’ do not have a view.  “You often get views that are in contrast with each other. It’s not always as crisp or clean as one would like.” A work in progress While the acquisitions have bulked up Franklin’s assets under management, the change in the interest-rate cycle has not yet provided the expected boost for the group’s reinvention. “The market is the biggest headwind,” Kapoor says. “[2022] has been one of the worst years on record for global markets . . . especially in terms of flows and clients being willing to put funds to work.” Blostein says the firm was “not positioned for the rising rate environment”, noting that it has been consistently one of the worst performers in most of its categories over the past six months.  Western Asset Management, a fixed-income specialist that Franklin acquired as part of the Legg Mason deal, suffered a year of brutal underperformance after betting that inflation would be short lived.   Many of the group’s bread-and-butter products in fixed income have also continued to struggle; the global bond fund was down 6 per cent in 2022. “It’s been extremely frustrating leading fixed income through its historically worst year ever,” says Sonal Desai, chief investment officer of Franklin’s fixed income group.  But she is hopeful that the firm is well positioned for a return to more normal market conditions for bonds. “We are well positioned for what I want from fixed income, which is the boring part,” she says, referring to the asset class’s reputation for steady returns. The lethargy in fixed income heightens the pressures for Franklin’s new businesses to deliver results. “The alts business should grow, and they think it will grow, but it is not enough to offset the organic decay in the other parts of their business,” Blostein says.  And although inflation, rising rates and greater volatility should play into the hands of skilled stockpickers, active management has yet to see its perennially promised return to popularity, particularly with retail investors, who have grown accustomed to rock-bottom fees and long bull markets.  But this is not the first time Franklin will have faced a seismic change in the industry, nor choppy markets, Kapoor says. “There’s a group of asset managers who are starting to prioritise not just the asset management of what they do, but also on the technology of how they deliver it.” Still, the rate of change within such an old company has been noticed. Shares in the group have risen by about a fifth since Jenny Johnson took over, ahead of the S&P 500 index and mid-tier rivals such as T Rowe Price and Janus Henderson.  The leadership changes and acquisitions took “a very boring stock that no one . . . cared about because it was viewed as a buggy-whipped company that hadn’t changed with the times”, Hawken says, “and at least made it a debate”. Jenny Johnson now aims to settle that debate — and a separate one with sibling Greg, who now chairs the San Francisco Giants baseball team.  “I do want to point out that . . . when I was on the [Giants’] board, we won three World Series.” Data visualisation by Chris Campbell","26.01.2023"
"Should retail investors buy gold?","While the precious metal retains its age-old shine, its investment value is less obvious","Gold loves uncertainty — something that is hardly missing in the world today.  Few thought that 2022 would deliver greater shocks after two years of pandemic-driven border closures, lockdowns and global supply chain snarls.  Yet the geopolitical turmoil triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis made 2022 even more volatile, sending gold prices surging to an all-time high above $2,000 per troy ounce in March as investors bought gold as a safe haven asset.  That was exactly as the gold bugs might have predicted. However, the bullion market is not so simple. The lustre came off the yellow metal as the year wore on as interest rate hikes aimed at fighting soaring inflation prompted institutional investors to sell gold as the higher yields on government bonds became too enticing to miss. Gold now trades at about $1,780 per troy ounce, following the US Federal Reserve lifting interest rates from near zero to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent, including this week’s hike. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank have also been raising rates. Still, that leaves the yellow metal above its September low of $1,600 and an $1,350 average price for the 2010s. Christopher Louney, commodity strategist at RBC, calls this the “long-running tug of war” between negative financial factors pulling down on gold prices and the metal’s attraction as a store of value during inflationary and/or risky times. But 2022 is coming to a close. What investors, including retail savers, need to know is what comes next. FT Money takes a look at what matters in the gold market and what doesn’t. Pivot or no pivot? For 2023, gold bulls and bears are poring over a complex range of factors from record central bank bullion purchases to China’s economic reopening and geopolitical risks, including the Ukraine war, the US-China political conflict over Taiwan, and tensions in the Middle East. But the most heated debate centres on the interplay between inflation and central bank intervention.  “The biggest impact on gold prices is the Fed rate policy and US real yields. It’s all about the opportunity cost of holding gold,” says Bernard Dahdah, senior commodities analyst at Natixis, a French investment bank. “The big question is: ‘is the Fed going to pivot or not?’” Higher yields on US government bonds push the dollar up as investors sell debt denominated in other currencies to profit from the better premiums on US Treasuries. That, in turn, has contributed to taking the shine off gold, which tends to trade inversely to the greenback. “It’s quite a thing to hold gold when interest rates are zero, it’s another to hold them when they’re 4 per cent,” says Giles Parkinson, managing director of global funds at Close Brothers Asset Management. Investors are assessing the effects of this week’s hike. Even though the Fed lifted rates by only 0.5 percentage points, following a series of 0.75 percentage point hikes, gold prices fell after the meeting as chair Jay Powell warned that he could not guarantee that the Fed’s forecast for peak interest rates would not be revised upwards again.  However, the consensus in the US markets remains that the central bank will start cutting rates in the second half of 2023. Paul Wong, market strategist at Sprott, an asset manager specialising in precious metals, says that gold as a safe haven is attractive because of the risk of recession and financial instability at a time when “the risk of massive rate hikes and a spiking US dollar are behind us”.  He argues that the Fed has signalled a slowdown in interest rate hikes after the better than expected US inflation reports. The US consumer price index fell on Tuesday to 7.1 per cent for last month, lower than the 7.3 per cent economists forecast, pushing gold above $1,800 on expectations that the US central bank could squeeze the economy less aggressively to tame inflation.   On Wong’s sums, these shifts led precious metals to be the best-performing asset group in November versus equities, the US dollar and bonds. However, one piece of evidence supporting the contrary view that the Fed will stay in its fight to tame inflation, is that the gulf between short-and long-term US borrowing costs has reached its widest point in just over 40 years.  This month, the two-year Treasury yield traded at 4.2 per cent, while the 10-year yield stood at 3.4 per cent, bringing the difference between the two to 0.84 percentage points. The pattern, known as a yield curve “inversion”, has preceded every US economic downturn of the past 50 years.  Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS, the Swiss bank which is the world’s largest wealth manager, says that “it’s too early to call for a Fed pivot” and “it’s not yet time to buy gold”. But he adds: “We believe in 2023 there will be a period where it’s interesting to buy gold when the market starts to smell that the Fed will cut interest rates.”  Debt crisis and persistent inflation Gold bugs highlight the fears coursing through markets that things could yet turn out worse than the Fed hopes. Gold has proven its worth in previous economic downturns, delivering positive returns in five out of the last seven recessions since 1973, including in the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 Covid shock, according to the World Gold Council, an industry group.  Gold bugs argue that the huge levels of debt worldwide could force central banks to reverse course on monetary policy sooner rather than later.  Worldwide debt as ratio to gross domestic product at 247 per cent, is far higher than before 2007 when it was below 200 per cent, according to the IMF. Borrowing for pandemic spending has come on top of debts incurred during the global financial crisis and its aftermath. Much debt is denominated in US dollars, the strength of which has made those loans bigger for borrowers in other currencies, while servicing has become more costly with rising interest rates. Peter Marrone, chair of Yamana Gold, a Canadian gold mining company that was recently subject to a takeover battle, says that central banks cannot keep raising interest rates in the face of the growing debt burden facing poorer economies, something on which the World Bank renewed its warning this month. “What happens to all of that debt when the dollar is going up, local currencies are devaluing and interest rates are going up,” says Marrone. “It just becomes untenable to maintain that and at some point central banks will have to recognise that.” Marrone further warns that there is a high risk of returning to 1970s-style “dramatic inflation” because pricing pressures are being driven by systemic issues such as labour shortages and under-investment that monetary policy cannot solve.  In real terms, the all-time high gold price was actually hit in 1980 when it exceeded $800 per troy ounce, says Marrone. Adjusted for the present day value of the dollar would be close to $2,700 per troy ounce. That leaves a lot of road to run for gold prices now, he argues. In a more measured view, Robert Crayfourd, manager of the CQS Natural Resources Growth & Income fund, says there is “real potential for things to fall over. We believe gold is relatively cheap insurance”. However, even while acknowledging the short-term attractions of adding gold to portfolios in expectation of a Fed pivot, some fund managers see less of a long-term role for the yellow metal.  It faces a “generational headwind” from being poorly understood by young western investors more interested in crypto, as well as having no role in the green transition, says Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP, a precious metals group. It also produces no income — at a time when investors, especially the big institutions, have a wider range of income-generating portfolio asset choices than ever. “The curse and blessing of gold is it doesn’t have any yield,” says Parkinson at Close Brothers. He adds that many equities will have strong earnings prospects even if recession strikes. This argument would be still stronger if there is an unexpectedly smooth exit from high inflation into a solid economic recovery in the US and Europe. Such an environment, says Dahdah at Natixis, “is more bullish for equities than gold”.  Meanwhile, a successful post-Covid economic reopening by China could also be bearish for bullion, says John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council (WGC). “A pick-up in inflation could be a headwind for gold as the Fed could tighten more quickly. That could come from a China reopening.”  Pillars of price support But the gold bulls have other big guns in their armoury. A key factor supporting gold has been the record level of central bank buying. Central banks bought almost 400 tonnes of gold in the third quarter — the largest since 2000 when quarterly records began — according to the WGC. Central bank bullion purchases for the first nine months of 2022 have outstripped any year since 1967. Gold executives speculate that China and Russia were behind the purchases as they diversify holdings after western allies froze $300bn of Russia’s foreign currency reserves. That was partially confirmed last week when the People’s Bank of China reported a 32-tonne rise in its gold holdings in November, the first increase in more than three years. Moreover, central bank buying has been joined by a clamour for gold among retail investors. They have snapped up bars and coins out of concern that inflation may be more persistent than professional money managers believe, according to WGC data. And they are perhaps more worried about the geopolitical risks, whether it is the Ukraine war or rising tensions over Taiwan.  “US retail investors seem to have adhered to the idea that gold bar and coin investments offer protection in periods of stubbornly high inflation and economic uncertainty,” says Alan Goldberg, an analyst at BestBrokers. Jewellery purchases driven by consumers in China and India returned to normal pre-Covid levels in the third quarter of this year, while bar and coin demand was the strongest since 2011, growing 36 per cent year-on-year. Furthermore, gold may benefit from the crisis in cryptocurrencies following the collapse of the exchange FTX. “With cryptocurrencies in the doldrums, we think gold stands alone as a non-debasable asset of last resort,” says Louney of RBC. But central banks and retail investors aren’t the whole market. The biggest financial investors — institutions — have been unconvinced by the bull arguments until now. Gold-backed exchange traded funds, dominated by institutional investors, have experienced outflows for seven consecutive months. Some fund managers say the exodus from gold ETFs could accelerate at the end of the year as portfolios come under review and the opportunity cost of holding gold comes into focus. Parkinson says: “If investors buy a lot of gold and open up that box in 10 years' time, they will still have a lump of gold.” The bulls retort that is all very well when the economic outlook is stable. But it’s not. Shaun Usmar, chief executive of Triple Flag Precious Metals, a metals financing company, says: “Do you think the world in 2023 will become more crazy or less crazy than it was in 2022?” He may be right. However, 2022 also showed that investors can take even big shocks in their stride. Why shouldn’t they cope with 2023’s surprises just as well? How can you buy gold?There are three main ways to gain exposure to the gold price as a retail investor: bars and coins, gold-backed exchange traded funds and gold mining equities.Bars and coins give you a piece of metal you can store at home, giving you something physical to hold in your hands. They range in size from one-tenth of an ounce to one kilo or larger. The disadvantage is that the premiums to pay over the spot gold price to buy bars and coins can be substantial, meaning there is a big transaction cost once you sell the gold back, as well as storage and insurance costs. Gold-backed ETFs have evolved into two main categories of high and low-cost products. These save the buyer from taking physical custody of the bullion. The higher-cost products provide greater liquidity with low transaction costs but are better suited to fund managers moving hundreds of millions of dollars at a time. For retail investors, a newer generation of ETFs with lower management fees and less liquidity are better suited such as Invesco’s Physical Gold ETF or BlackRock’s iShares Gold Trust. Gold mining company equities is another option to gain exposure to prices of the yellow metal. However, these can come with surprises, positive and negative. If discoveries are made, the share price may rally sharply but if there are technical or political problems, the shares can tank irrespective of the gold price. The world’s largest gold mining companies — Newmont, Barrick Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines — are all dual-listed on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges. Gold mining equity funds including VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF are a way to diversify risks.Precious metals streaming companies are another set of equities to consider, since they take small cuts on sales of many projects in return for providing financing, meaning the risks of each project or company is diluted in a broader portfolio. Among the largest listed precious metals streaming groups are Canada’s Franco-Nevada and Wheaton Precious Metals.","16.12.2022"
"David Craig: Our economic system is completely dependent on nature","The co-chair of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures says natural systems and long-term human prosperity go hand in hand","David Craig first became known to investors for running Refinitiv, the big data company, for 15 years — a business that plays a central role in the City of London and financial markets globally.  But, a couple of years ago, he left to take up the role of co-chair of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. His aim in doing so has been to bring the natural and financial worlds together, working with his co-chair, Elizabeth Mrema.  Under their leadership, the TNFD has been developing nature-based corporate reporting systems, to track water usage and environmental impacts as closely as carbon emissions, and it has gained backing from companies including Nestlé, Tata Steel, HSBC, Kirin and BlackRock.  Here, Craig talks to Gillian Tett — chair of the FT’s editorial board, and editor-at- large, US — about the progress made to date and the work still to do.   Gillian Tett: David, what is this rather ugly acronym: TNFD? What do you actually do? And why did you — as someone who’s been in the mainstream financial world for so long — decide to get involved? David Craig: We’re a market-led taskforce. We have nearly 950 members around the world — including financial institutions, corporates, nature companies and others — and we’re creating a global framework where you can assess, identify, manage and disclose nature-related risks.  Climate Exchange Following the success of our monthly Economists Exchange and Tech Exchange dialogues, the FT has launched Climate Exchange: conversations between FT reporters and the business leaders, innovators and top academics in the fields of sustainability, energy and the environment. The dialogues are in-depth and detailed, focusing on the challenges of tackling climate and changing our energy mix.  Now, why is that important? Why do we need to do that? We need to do that because our economic system is completely dependent on nature. And we are removing and reducing the amount of fertile land and of water. We’re reducing pollination capabilities. All of these things that we’re doing to the natural system are not just damaging the planet — which is bad — but actually damaging the prospects for companies and investors. We have these externality risks, and we have to bring those in and manage them.  At TNFD, our goal is very simple. We’re trying to redirect financial investment into nature-positive outcomes, so that we make sure that we manage these risks and create more opportunity in how we work with nature.  Why did I want to volunteer for this role? Well, I’ve always been passionate about the natural system, but I’ve also been very passionate about financial services. And I believe that, when they’re directed in the right way, they can do enormous good: drive economies, provide jobs, mortgages, loans, investments. But what I saw, having worked with environmental, social and governance data for many, many years, was that financial systems are only good when they manage risk, and identify and value risk, properly. They basically assume that the natural system is free. It costs nothing to destroy a forest. It costs nothing to use as much water as you want, or to pollute. And therein lies the problem.  Financial services . . . basically assume that the natural system is free. It costs nothing to destroy a forest. It costs nothing to use as much water as you want, or to pollute. And therein lies the problem So we’ve got to, in effect, change the valuation, pricing and risk approach within financial markets to make sure that we put a value on the natural system. And we have to do that recognising that climate and nature are two sides of the same coin. You can’t separate the two; they’re totally integrated in the view of the planet. We might have separated how we think about them. But we’re trying to integrate them.  That’s why I was really passionate about doing this because I really think we can make some change in how financial markets work for the good of the natural system. GT: I must say I find it fascinating that someone like you has jumped across because you’ve been involved in very hard data at the centre of the capitalist machine for many, many years. It used to be the case that people who were talking about nature were more on the hippie, activist side of the world. So it’s a very interesting sign of the times that you’re now involved in this. But I’m curious. In the last few years, we’ve seen a lot of focus on carbon emissions: the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) came out some time ago, and the thing about carbon is that it’s pretty tangible what you’re measuring; it’s just one thing. How on earth do you try to measure something as soft, intangible and complex as nature? DC: Well, it’s certainly complex. And you’re right that CO₂ or greenhouse gas emissions are identifiable and measurable. You can have a singular goal like [limiting the Celsius increase above pre-industrial temperatures to] 1.5 degrees. Now, welcome to the world of nature, which is far more complex and interrelated. What we’re doing with the taskforce and our members — amazing companies and investors around the world who’ve really been focusing on this — is trying to break down that complexity.  So, how do I break down the complexity of the natural system, and guide companies and investors to think about and reduce the problem? Here’s one example. Very early on, we published a standard definition of what we call the biomes and the realms of nature and how they interface with business. What does that mean? Well, there are four realms: ocean freshwater, atmosphere, and earth. Then you break that down into 34 biomes, which are areas of land or water with distinct ecosystem services and attributes that you have to be aware of. So what we’ve effectively done is say that the planet is a big place but, if you really break it down, you can separate it into these scientifically recognised biomes.  If I’m sourcing materials from one of those biomes, or [basing] my factories or output [there], or investing in one of those areas, I then have a very good understanding of whether, in that type of ecosystem, I need to be more careful about water — or pollutants, or land uses.  It’s breaking down the problem so you can really understand it and grapple with that complexity. We’ve got to stop complexity being an excuse for not doing this because financial markets are very complex, and they deal with incredible things and make them very manageable. So I think the challenge here is not to see complexity as a problem, but actually to embrace that complexity and really make this work for the market.  GT: The reality is, though, if you look at the financial system and the discussion around green issues, you’ve had this incredible attention on the carbon issue. It’s partly due to factors like Greta Thunberg, and stuff like that. You’ve had the climate conferences — COP25, 6, 7, 8 — they grab a lot of attention. Yet when the UN had its own meeting at the end of last year on the environment and on biodiversity issues, it got almost no attention at all. Does that frustrate you? Do you think that means a lot of the green debate has been going in the wrong direction? Top billing: efforts to tackle carbon emissions — the focus of the UN’s COP27 meeting last year — have distracted attention from biodiversity initiatives, though that is starting to change  © JOSEPH EID/AFP via Getty Images DC: Well, if we all had the power of wonderful hindsight, we probably wouldn’t have started with carbon and climate. We’d have started with the whole natural system, and looked at climate and nature together, as part of that. But here we are. We started with climate because we recognised the emergency and the challenge that was happening.  I’d say, though, that, since I’ve been on this task force in the last few years, the amount of attention and awareness has just exploded. You mentioned the UN COP15 conference in Montreal. Thousands of business representatives from finance were there — it was the first time ever that they were there. Over 400 companies and financial institutions signed the “Make It Mandatory” declaration, on mandatory disclosures on nature. I’ve only been working in this field for a couple of years but everyone who told me they’d spent 20 years in this field said this was a complete change. You’ve got financial investors and heads of banking talking about soil carbon capabilities. I was at [the World Economic Forum in] Davos earlier this year, and I was going to panels with bankers talking about soil and its carbon retention capabilities! Normally, we talk about bitcoin and blockchain. Finally, we’re talking about something real and substantive like soil carbon.  34%Proportion of total potential greenhouse gas reduction that comes from land use, agriculture, food production, farming, and forestry I think the other breakthrough was that we started to listen to scientists, which is really good after many years of ignoring them. If you read the IPCC report from last year, they said something very interesting which didn’t get a huge amount of attention but is now getting attention: when you look at the total greenhouse gas reduction capability of the planet, over 34 per cent of that total reduction would come from land use, agriculture, food production, farming and forestry — more than industry, more than energy, 13 times more than electrifying the entire world’s transportation system.  And the scientists have basically said: “Look, we’re staring right at this. We’ve got to start preserving forests. We’ve got to rethink how we do farming and agriculture. We’ve got to start harnessing nature as an asset to fight climate change.”  If you look at the big debate around [carbon] offsets, you find 90 per cent of them are nature based. So the penny is really dropping with anyone focused on climate: they’re finding it impossible to not look at nature.  When I started this project, people would say to me: “It’s fantastic what you’re doing, David, but we’ll solve climate first and then we’ll get around to nature.” Now, that’s completely changed. They’re realising they can’t get to net zero without actually using nature-based solutions and nature systems for the natural planet. We’ve started to finally listen to scientists about what’s really happening. Burning problem: smoke and vapour rise from a power station in Germany. Nature-based solutions are increasingly seen as integral to the fight against climate change © Lukas Schulze/Getty Images GT: A banker said to me the other day: “I’ve never known my colleagues to be so interested not just in soil but in worms” — which was quite a change! And I’m very struck by the fact that one of the other hard-headed, ultra-capitalist bankers I know who’s also moved across to this area is Hank Paulson, the former US Treasury secretary — a man who used to run Goldman Sachs. He is absolutely red-hot on championing this focus on biodiversity. His group has issued a number of very punchy papers, trying to do things like put a price on bumblebees or worms or things like that.  And the point he often makes, as a [US] Republican, is that the beauty of talking about the environment — instead of just about climate and carbon — is you get a much bigger bipartisan audience. People often forget that it was actually under Richard Nixon, it was Republicans who forced a lot of the campaigns around the environment and the protection of national parks — or the creation of national parks — in America. The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency came under a Republican government because a lot of Republicans care about the land and the idea of being a steward of environmental heritage.  Do you have any hope that talking more about nature, rather than about Greta Thunberg and climate, might be a way to get a more inclusive group into climate change discussions? DC: I think you’re absolutely right. As you said earlier, greenhouse gas emissions are more measurable, but they’re less tangible. When nature is destroyed, you tend to see it much more quickly. When the forests are cut down. Or when they’re burning — you see the fires from space. You don’t see the CO₂. But you do see the pollutants, you see what’s happening in our waterways. So it’s much more tangible. It has much broader appeal, sometimes, than the climate debate.  You can’t assess nature risk without looking at local communities. Ninety per cent of farms are below a hectare in size. The best stewards of land and nature are local people And the other thing that we found, particularly through the pilots that we’re running — we have around 200 pilots, from Brazil to palm oil to mineral extraction — is that nature risk, from a financial perspective, is far more direct and it’s far more immediate. What do I mean by that? If you invest in a coal-fired power station, you emit CO₂ that collects in the atmosphere and it contributes to the overall impact. But if you invest in farmland and you use too much fertiliser and you destroy the fertility, or you cut down the surrounding woodlands and create floods, that impact is more direct and it’s more immediate. So you actually get people thinking about stewardship much, much more quickly than you do climate — which is why I often wish we’d done nature and incorporated climate within that, rather than doing climate [first] and now looking at the bigger picture of nature.  I think climate [campaigners] looked at goals first and setting targets, and then thought about the effect on people. But what we’ve done with TNFD [is say] you can’t assess nature risk and impacts without looking at local communities. Ninety per cent of farms are below a hectare in size. The best stewards of land and nature are actually local people. So you have to incorporate local communities and societies right from the outset and not think about it as something later . . . You get a far larger stakeholder group when it’s engaged and passionate.  You’re absolutely right about the left and right polarisation and the national parks because conservatism is about preservation as much as economic growth — and, if we don’t preserve these things, then we won’t have economic growth, either. I think the penny is dropping in economies around the world that these two things go side by side. You don’t have economic growth unless we have a productive natural system. GT: The same is true in the UK: you hear [different] views about nature across the political spectrum. If David Attenborough had been the cheerleader for the movement, not Greta Thunberg, I think it would be much easier to have an inclusive tone. But, given that you have the advantage of coming in with a TNFD after the TCFD was created, what else have you learned about how to go about getting some traction? When can we expect a tangible framework to emerge? DC: Really good question. I think your point about learning from TCFD has been really important. So a couple of thoughts on that, and I’ll explain where we are. So right from the outset, we said let’s not reinvent the wheel. Let’s learn and build on what TCFD did so successfully for now over six years. So we reused as much of the TCFD framework as we possibly could — partly because of familiarisation and lowering the friction of adoption, and partly because actually we see that climate and nature are issues that will be dealt with together.  So, by using the same TCFD framework with TNFD, we already have companies now doing combined TCFD and TNFD reporting, which is fantastic for actually putting their teams together. They’re going through the same governance process. They’re using the same four pillars of TCFD and TNFD. That was one of our main learnings: let’s reuse as much as we can of the TCFD framework. That’s been really well received by the market, particularly the financial participants in the market.  The other thing we learned very quickly is great frameworks are nothing without adoption. This is like building software — I’m from a software background — [in that] you can build fantastic software programs but, unless you get adoption, it is a complete waste of time. So thinking early about adoption is really important.  I wanted to remove this excuse of: ‘Oh well, we can’t manage nature because there’s not enough data.’ That is complete rubbish. It’s about pulling the data together One thing that we did was to recognise straight away that data was essential to be able to assess nature-related risks, the state of nature [and] the conditions of nature. Now, the really good news is there’s been an absolute explosion of nature-related data in the last couple of years. There are thousands of low-orbit satellites. We’re literally imaging every square kilometre of the earth pretty much every day. There is no shortage of data. I think the challenge is its consistency, how it fits together, how it’s usable.  So we created a data catalyst. It’s got over 160 companies in there — from the traditional government-backed and UN-backed, to the financial market traditional players, to the new satellite firms using AI and machine learning to try to ease this problem. We’ve done some fantastic pilots and case studies. We’ve actually documented the data sets that can be used at every stage of the TNFD process. There’s a lot further to go. But I wanted to remove this excuse of: “Oh well, we can’t manage nature because there’s not enough data.” That is complete rubbish. It’s about pulling this data together.  The other thing is around training and capabilities. I remember as a CEO when the first request came in to fill out our TCFD approach, and complete forms for [environmental disclosure organisation] CDP. Everyone looked at each other thinking: “What is this? We don’t really understand it and how do we go about it?” There was no training or education or capabilities. I feel like we invest so much energy debating taxonomies but we don’t invest enough in training and education. So we’ve embarked on a whole workstream about capability building. We’ve got a lot further to go [but] we’ve got the support of the UN and other people. We have a vision to create an ecosystem of commercial training providers that can take the framework of TNFD and really help educate people around it.  So, the final question is: where are we? Well, the really exciting news is we are weeks away from our final beta release [of our disclosure framework] . . . which will include disclosure metrics. Everyone wants to know about the disclosure metrics — the previous releases have been about the methodology, the definitions, and the approach.  We will then complete the testing — the 200 pilots around the world. And, then, in September, we’ll take the final feedback and iterations and publish our final recommendations. We’re actually pretty close. And we have a lot of companies already starting to use it, which is fantastic.  Take nothing for granted: Japanese drinks company Kirin carried out a TNFD assessment of water-related risks © Kirin GT: Can you name any companies? DC: Hot off the press: UBS published the first report at a very high level, including TCFD and TNFD reference. Kirin, the Japanese beverage company, did a full TNFD assessment looking at their exposure to water, in particular, in other parts of the world. Axa have also started to use TNFD. And many others too. So people are actually building it into their vocabulary and starting to get their head around how to think about it.  But my message to everyone is: there is a learning curve. Not every portfolio manager is an expert in nature. And we may not expect them all to be complete experts, but we would expect their organisations to understand how to think about ecosystem services and nature-related risk.  It does take time to build up that knowledge and I think our encouragement is for everyone not to wait, and to start now — because it will take a couple of years to build that. Nestlé, one of our task force members, has built a data set that understands every location of their operation. Now you’d kind of expect that every company would know that, but you’d be surprised. One of the things about nature is that — unlike climate — you have to know where you’re operating, to a pretty precise location. And not every company knows that. They have a legal entity database that says: “My legal entity is in the UK”, whether it is in Scotland or Wales or London. So you have to get that knowledge and that data set, too. A lot of learnings from this can be built into the approach. GT: I guess the message really is that, for corporate boards and investment groups, it’s time to get familiar with the value of these worms, the soil, water, and everything else. Particularly water, because that often has the most immediate impact on corporate activities.

Get in touch with us anytime: Due.Diligence@ft.com In today’s newsletter: Twitter gets MuskedThe Issa brothers fly privateMichael Klein returns to Wall Street Musk sinks his teeth into Twitter It took a bit of arm twisting, but Elon Musk finally closed his deal to buy Twitter last week — paying $44bn for the social media platform.  “The bird is freed,” he wrote on the platform. So were, it seems, a lot of the company’s top brass, who were quickly informed that their services were no longer needed (and escorted to the door). Among them were chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde, head of legal, policy and trust.  Elon Musk has already fired some of Twitter’s top executives   © Financial Times No one expected Musk to keep any of these executives, since he had just spent months trashing them and the company they ran. Then again, no one could have foreseen that Musk would flip-flop for months as he attempted to wrangle out of legally binding contracts.  Who are we kidding? This has become a sport for Musk.  Per their employment agreements, the executives were expected to receive tens of millions of dollars in the event that Twitter was taken private and they were fired.  Instead, Musk has terminated them “for cause”, meaning that he believes that he had valid legal justification to fire them, which would get Twitter out of having to pay for their golden parachutes. We can almost hear employment lawyers taking a big breath.  In their place, Musk has brought in some of his closest confidants, which include his lawyer, Alex Spiro; venture capitalist David Sacks; a16z partner Sriram Krishnan; and Valor Equity Partners founder Antonio Gracias. His biographer, Walter Isaacson, is also roaming about and doing some sort of pseudo public relations job, it seems.  Musk isn’t being indiscriminate about his firing. The self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” who wants to bring “widely diverse viewpoints” to Twitter has asked managers and advisers to name who should stay and who should be sacked based on who supports him as a leader.    For those who pledge allegiance to Musk, there are tough times ahead.   The mercurial billionaire has ordered Twitter staff to work around the clock to implement a charge on users to keep their verified “blue tick”.  The idea is to charge a fixed fee for users who want to have a verified account, something that has been free for politicians, chief executives, famous people and yes, us journalists. The move is seen as a hedge against a possible drop in advertising revenue as companies fret over loosening content moderation on the platform.  Eagerly watching how Musk plans to make money will be the banks that agreed to lend him almost $13bn and now are having a very difficult time offloading that debt. DD’s Antoine Gara, Eric Platt and Ortenca Aliaj report that lenders such as Barclays, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are waiting to see a clear business plan from Musk to start marketing the debt.  This brings us to the winners and losers of the Twitter-Musk deal.  In the winning camp are JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which advised on the deal but thought better than to lend Musk money. Agrawal and his cohort could also find themselves on this list if they can deploy their golden parachutes.  The losers include Twitter employees, the lenders, and most of all, the long-suffering journalists who have had to cover every twist and turn in this saga — but also you, the readers.   To anyone feeling dispirited about a billionaire owning one of the most influential social media platforms, DD’s Rob Smith has some words of hope: it could ultimately end up in the lenders’ hands. Let that sink in.  To everyone freaking out about Elon Musk owning twitter, relax. In 18 months the 2nd lien lenders will own it.— Robert Smith (@BondHack) October 5, 2022

 Welcome to Issa Airways  If you ask a bank to lend you money for a private jet, it will typically demand at least two things: first, you pay interest, and second, the bank will have security over the jet.  But EG Group, the highly leveraged petrol stations business co-owned by private equity firm TDR Capital and Blackburn, England-born brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, isn’t a bank.  And it made no such demands when it lent €39mn to the brothers’ personal companies in the Isle of Man to buy two planes in 2018.  All it got was a guarantee from the brothers — and the ability to use their planes, as long as it paid them standard commercial rates.  The brothers, who also co-own the supermarket chain Asda with TDR, own a Bombardier Global 6000 and a smaller Bombardier Challenger 350.  Both have vanity call signs ending in EG, even though they belong to the brothers, not the company. The smaller plane has “hand-sculpted seats”, according to a listing online, where it is available to hire, and the big plane has an “elegant stateroom” and Jo Malone toiletries.  The generous interest-free nature of EG’s loans to its shareholders has now been flagged internally as part of an audit process. The brothers are going to be charged backdated interest at a rate to be determined by EG, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  What should that rate be? It’s hard to tell, since banks are not generally falling over themselves to make unsecured loans for aircraft purchases. The rate should be “multiples higher” in the absence of such security, a private jet lawyer said.  The brothers own the planes through entities called Clear Sky LP and Clear Sky 2 LP. Here’s a chart showing how it works:   How common is this type of arrangement? Have you seen it elsewhere? Email kaye.wiggins@ft.com if so.   Credit Suisse’s new man on Wall Street Like many of the Spac frenzy’s most prolific sponsors, former Citigroup dealmaker Michael Klein is sitting atop a large fortune he made as a result of shareholdings received on favourable terms. Now that the blank-cheque boom has effectively gone bust, the Wall Street veteran has moved on to yet another lucrative, well-timed deal: taking over Credit Suisse’s investment bank, CS First Boston. The deal, set to be completed by the middle of next year, will be structured as a spin-off and subsequent takeover of Credit Suisse’s capital markets and advisory business by M Klein & Company, DD’s Arash Massoudi and the FT’s Owen Walker report. Michael Klein has been deeply involved in the restructuring of Credit Suisse and has been a member of its board since 2018 © Bloomberg A similar deal has been pulled off successfully before. The plan echoes Blackstone’s 2014 spin-off of its advisory and restructuring business to form PJT Partners, when it combined with an advisory boutique led by former Morgan Stanley dealmaker Paul Taubman. Unlike Taubman, though, Klein has likely been planning this deal for some time from the inside. A Credit Suisse board member since 2018, he has been deeply involved in the ailing Swiss lender’s restructuring and will preside over the newly formed CS First Boston as chief executive. The move cements his return to the helm of a Wall Street firm after his 2008 departure from Citi, where he was once considered a potential successor of its former leader Sandy Weill and advised Barclays on its purchase of Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis. Klein has until now maintained a relatively low profile, his firm only recently adding a sparse website. CS First Boston will be no such low-key operation.  He is preparing for Credit Suisse to reduce its shareholding to below a majority stake through stakes sales and an initial public offering. A portion of equity would be set aside as a means to entice top bankers to join the firm, as Credit Suisse seeks to narrow the gap between itself and its US rivals on Wall Street.

"How long can Japan’s central bank defy global market forces?","Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is betting on a royal flush of macroeconomic outcomes to win the battle. But the costs, and the risks, are rising","There’s a Chinese proverb that holds it is better to plan one’s means of retreat than 36 different ways to win the battle. The axiom has cropped up on Tokyo trading floors this autumn, after Japan lavished a record $62bn to fight the yen’s collapse below a three-decade low, in as many as four separate interventions since September. That is only one front in its war against global market forces. By the end of June, after months fighting to control the yield curve, the Bank of Japan had raised its holdings of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) to over half a quadrillion yen ($3.6tn). Last week, to fight the negative impact of inflation, the government unveiled a $200bn stimulus package.  There is mounting fear, however, that an orderly retreat may be impossible. Instead the BoJ is betting everything on yet another strategy aimed at winning the battle. It is making a giant gamble that a royal flush of national and international outcomes will solve its most pressing problems: sizeable wage increases by Japanese companies, the onset of “good” inflation, visible stability in the yen, a soft US recession and an interest rate pivot by the Federal Reserve. But at the same time, the radars of investors around the world are beeping noisily with signs of a potentially explosive Japan crisis.   In an October blog post that went viral, George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank strategist, described Japan’s yield curve control policy — curbing the short and long-term interest rates on Japanese government bonds — as “for all intents and purposes, already broken”.  The yield curve not only demonstrated the scale of policy distortion but its likely limits, too, he wrote. The BoJ is reaching “near-full ownership” of the three bond yields it has targeted, meaning “the time is soon approaching where these bonds will stop trading in their entirety and the market will simply cease to exist”, he wrote. But the JGB market is just one symptom of a larger distortion, analysts and traders say. Too much of the current Japanese policy mix and its secondary market effects seem unsustainable, says the head of one global fund, and waiting for the outcome of Japan’s bet could become unbearable.  The Bank of Japan headquarters. A disorderly exit by the BoJ from the bond market would cause a huge surge in 10-year Japanese government bond yields © Noriko Hayashi/Bloomberg Despite the interventions, Japan’s currency continues to test new lows around ¥150 against the dollar. The widening interest rate differential between Japan and the US means few are yet confident where the yen will find a natural floor. With Japan the only major economy still running a zero-interest-rate policy, the BoJ is looking ever more isolated.  “There’s a logic and a strategy behind what the BoJ is doing, but it’s a risky one. Everything could work out reasonably well as long as we are in a scenario next year where there’s clear evidence of US inflation coming down,” says Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. “The big risk is if that doesn’t happen. They want to relax yield curve control in a world where global bond yields are coming down. If they’re not, then the longer they leave it, the more disorderly the exit,” he adds. Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore, says the closest analogy to understand the potential consequences would be the Swiss National Bank’s abrupt removal of the ceiling on the Swiss franc in 2015, which led to a large jump in the currency and left European equity markets reeling. “But Switzerland is a small economy compared to Japan,” Mohi-uddin says. A disorderly exit by the BoJ would cause a huge surge in 10-year Japanese government bond yields, causing “major disruptions” for bondholders, from domestic pension funds to central bank reserve managers overseas. The Nikkei would plunge, he adds, with the ripples felt across global stock markets. The expectation of inflation To market watchers, the BoJ’s determination to carry on with its experiment appears dangerous in a world where countries are scrambling to keep inflation at bay. But for Haruhiko Kuroda, this is exactly the moment he had been waiting for since he became Bank of Japan governor in March 2013 vowing to do “whatever it takes” to end the country’s bouts of mild yet corrosive deflation.  Helped by a global surge in commodity prices caused by the war in Ukraine, prices of goods in Japan are rising with inflation hitting 3 per cent, surpassing the BoJ’s target of 2 per cent. More importantly, both companies and households now expect prices to increase over the next few years, after almost two decades of believing that prices could only go down.  Companies and households expect prices to increase over the next few years, after almost two decades of believing that prices could only go down © Richard Brooks/AFP/Getty Images The enduring assumption that prices in Japan will not change is finally crumbling, says Kentaro Koyama, Deutsche Bank’s chief Japan economist in Tokyo. “To take advantage of this precious opportunity, monetary policy needs to encourage price change, and this is why the BoJ’s bias toward maintaining its current monetary policy is reasonable,” he says, in a striking change of tone from his colleague Saravelos.  According to the latest consumer confidence survey released by Japan’s cabinet office this week, 63 per cent of those polled said they expected prices to rise 5 per cent or more over the coming year.  The BoJ’s Tankan, a closely watched survey on business sentiment, also showed that in September, Japanese companies expected an inflation rate of 2 per cent within five years, the highest level since it began polling such expectations in 2014.  Creating the presumption of inflation is critical in Japan, a country that has struggled to dislodge the expectations set by 15 years of on-and-off deflation between 1998 and 2013. This mindset has also posed the biggest hurdle for rising prices to be reflected in employee earnings. The worry for the BoJ is not a wage spiral that could result in a more prolonged period of high inflation, as it is in the US and Europe, but the opposite: the lack of strong wage growth that would shield the economy from falling back into a deflationary spiral. A weaker yen may also help kindle wage growth. Even though benefits have waned as companies have shifted manufacturing abroad, a softer currency still increases corporate profits made overseas when they are repatriated and the hope is that robust earnings will make it easier for businesses to raise wages. “To get rid of the deflationary mindset, they were prepared to see a weaker currency. What they wanted badly was for this inflation rate of 3 per cent to be translated into higher wages. This is the most important thing in Japan,” says a former senior BoJ official. Wage growth needed The ace in the hole for the BoJ, say analysts, may not be a potential pivot by the Fed, but the “shunto” wage negotiations in the spring.  These annual talks between unions and employers have for many years delivered a build-up of hope followed by a collective slouch of disappointment among workers across the country.  In a sign of changing times, the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) is seeking a 5 per cent year-on-year increase in wages — 3 per cent in terms of base pay — during the spring negotiations, the highest since 1995. If such a serious wage hike is in prospect, it would also coincide with the change in BoJ governorship when Kuroda’s term expires in April.  What is holding [investors] back is that they feel they don’t yet know how much further the yen could fall and whether the 150 level is the answer or whether it could fall further towards 175 or 200 If a trend for a steady wage rise can be confirmed, that might give the next BoJ governor confidence to consider reining in the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) programme. Kuroda has argued that any tightening would be premature with Japan’s core inflation expected to fall below its 2 per cent target by next year, but the BoJ’s current forecast does not take into account potential wage hikes by companies in spring. “Strong wage growth is seen as the ultimate ‘amulet’ against Japan slipping back into disinflation,” argues David Bowers, co-founder of Absolute Strategy Research. “If [the talks] succeed, then it may be that the Bank of Japan — under Kuroda’s successor — can start to pivot away from its QQE narrative, with implications for the yen and for bond yields not just in Japan but around the world.” Still, economists are divided on how much companies would be willing to increase employees’ pay after resisting for so long. While some are cautiously raising the price of their products, others are still afraid consumers will balk at higher prices, creating a chicken-and-egg problem for corporate Japan. “If companies generate profits and raise wages, demand might pick up. But which comes first? Companies cannot raise wages if they are not making money, while consumers cannot buy goods at higher prices if their wages are not going up, ” says Masahiro Okafuji, chief executive of Itochu, one of Japan’s big five trading houses. “We can’t easily criticise the BoJ since companies will suffer as well if a wrong decision is made,” he adds. Time to buy Japan? The 28 per cent descent of the yen against the dollar so far this year has reignited the broader question of how investable Japanese markets are.  Ten years ago, the economic and regulatory reforms that took place under “Abenomics” pushed Tokyo-listed equities, as measured by the Topix index, into a multiyear rally and a near 100 per cent rise in value. But more recently, Japanese equities have to some extent become another highly visible symptom of where BoJ policy has far outstripped its original plan. In the two-and-a-half years that followed the arrival of Shinzo Abe as prime minister in 2012 and the appointment of Kuroda as BoJ governor, foreign investors bought a net ¥25tn of Japanese shares.  In the years between 2015 and today, they have reversed that completely, selling ¥25.6tn. Over the past 10 years, the BoJ has been a net buyer of ¥36tn, via its ETF-purchasing programme.  The circumstances might seem ripe for another rally. Japanese companies look relatively stable and, because of the yen, very cheap. In theory, a robust influx of foreign stock-buying would shore up the yen and create the kind of natural upward pressure that would save the Japanese authorities from digging ever deeper into the national store of US Treasuries to artificially support the currency. Japanese companies look relatively stable and, because of the yen, very cheap from an investing perspective © Shuji KajiyamaAP In reality, the yen is locked in a volatile trading pattern dictated by massive outflows by Japanese companies and asset managers. While that is causing instability, foreign investors may still decline to “buy Japan”.  Bruce Kirk, head equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, says currency stability is essential for investment committees to look at Japan again. “There is a lot of interest from foreign investors in Japan, but what is holding them back is that they feel they don’t yet know how much further the yen could fall and whether the 150 level is the answer or whether it could fall further towards 175 or 200.”  The Japanese authorities may be muddying the situation, say analysts, in how they are responding to the recent volatility of the yen. Repeated references by Japan’s finance minister Shunichi Suzuki and other officials to market speculators heavily overstate the role of hedge funds and other leveraged investors.  Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan forex and equity strategist at Bank of America, says that it was “real money” driving the yen’s fall this year: corporate Japan and domestic Japanese asset managers responding to the rate differential, Japan’s trade deficit and foreign direct investment deficit.   Unlike the period immediately before the 2008 global financial crisis, where speculators at home and abroad would borrow yen and sell it to buy higher-yielding assets in what was known as the “carry trade”, there is less excitement around such investments now, says Yamada. All the central bank can do now is wait out the storm, he adds. “The BoJ is trying to buy time, hoping that the US rates peak out and smoothing the moves where they can,” he adds. “How this will play out ultimately depends on the US side.” The exit ramp Few economists expect Kuroda to change course before his term expires next year. But when Japan eventually (and, some say, inevitably) does, it will be fraught with risk. Experts agree any hint of normalisation from the BoJ will require intricate communication with markets to avoid the risk of misinterpretation. “The BoJ will need to come up with a basic plan beforehand so that the market can expect what will be coming,” the former BoJ official says. Kuroda said as much at a news conference last week. Though “we are not thinking of a rate hike or an exit anytime soon . . . when the 2 per cent [inflation] target becomes reachable, the policy board will need to discuss the exit strategy and it will be important to properly communicate with the market,” he said.  Masamichi Adachi, chief economist at UBS in Tokyo, says the BoJ is likely to make a public assessment of the effects of its monetary policy during 2023 to signal an adjustment is looming. It did something similar before bringing in yield curve control, he says.  A first step might be to revise the BoJ’s forward guidance and widen the 0.25 per cent target on 10-year JGBs, Adachi adds. “We could call this process a beginning of policy normalisation for improving bond market function, allowing a smooth start without difficult pressure from markets.” Few economists expect Haruhiko Kuroda to change course before his term expires next year, but he told a news conference last week that any eventual moves would be clearly communicated © Kazuo Horiike/Jiji Press/Bloomberg On Wednesday, Kuroda dropped his biggest hint yet that a pivot point might be approaching. “If the achievement of our 2 per cent inflation target that is accompanied by wage hikes comes into sight, a review of the monetary policy will of course become necessary,” he told parliament.  But any tweak that is perceived to be too fast or beyond expectations could cause rapid repercussions across markets.  When yields in the UK spiked in the wake of September’s “mini” Budget, the Bank of England had to step in to support pension schemes facing sudden, unexpected liquidity issues. If the Japanese central bank were forced into a similar action with bondholders, the scale of intervention would need to be far, far larger — with much higher risk of global contagion.  Little wonder then that within the BoJ and the Japanese government, the crisis in the UK gilts market has become a cautionary tale. “It’s become a lesson for markets as well as policymakers that Japan must not become like the UK in terms of the turmoil that it caused,” says Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.  A disorderly exit is not yet on the cards. But Kuroda will be watching the flop carefully, hoping he reaches the end of his term with the strongest hand possible. ","03.11.2022"
"From Pakistan to the Philippines, women break open closed industries","Female pioneers make their mark as combat pilots, cricketers and chip technologists","In a cockpit somewhere over the clouds, Suwapich “Windy” Wongwiriyawanich lost sight of the curvature of the earth. There was to one side of her, the receding night sky and to the other, the glow of day breaking. “This is the place I should be,” the flight attendant mused. “Here in front of the plane — not in the back.” Those five minutes, floating between Thailand and India, set a new course for Suwapich. She applied to AirAsia’s first class of Thai cadets, clocked 2,000 flying hours, and became one of its first women pilots. Two decades on, Capt Windy still catches passengers by surprise when the timbre of her voice spills out of a plane’s speakers. Windy’s journey from cabin to cockpit is part of a wider story as more women across Asia take the controls in professions long dominated by men.  Women claiming new spaces, and clamouring for equality in them, is creating ripple effects for the larger gender ecosystem and for generations to come. Capt Suwapich Wongwiriyawanich, the First female pilot at Thai Air Asia X. © Adryel Talamantes For the first time in history, women in Asia now hold more combined wealth than in any region except North America, and the total is growing more rapidly than anywhere else in the world.  Charting new vocational terrain, women in Asia (excluding Japan) are adding $2tn to their wealth each year and will hold $27tn in 2026, according to analysis done by Boston Consulting Group for Nikkei Asia this year. That is $6tn more than forecast for women in western Europe. The surge is driven, in part, by women venturing into careers previously home only to men. Also at play are factors such as parental leave and social structures, including reproductive rights and child care in homes with three generations or relatively cheaper nannies.  “Female workers, whether they work online or offline, who have some family support, have greater flexibility to work longer hours and expand their business,” said Hue-Tam Jamme, an assistant professor at Arizona State University. She is also a fellow at JustJobs Network, a labour think-tank whose research in Thailand and Cambodia shows women do twice as much unpaid care work as men.  Rising levels of education, urbanisation and travel have also reshaped gender mores. But despite the glossy statistics and rising employment, women remain the second sex financially — they will need 151 years to close the economic gap with men if nothing changes, the World Economic Forum said in a report that measured pay, unemployment, access to finance and land, among other data. In many places, women are also fighting conservative families to carve out paths for themselves that are still considered unorthodox. Ishmita Nagi, a former fashion designer who swapped one runway for another when she became a pilot at Indian carrier IndiGo, said she has crossed paths with many such women. “I salute those girls . . . because I don’t think that without the immense support that I have had from my family I could have come so far,” she told Nikkei Asia in an interview. © Getty ImagesInfoAccording to a UN report, a poor and rural woman is 5 times as likely as a rich urban woman to get married before the age of 18 . . . 21.8 times as likely to have never attended school. . . 5.8 times as likely to become an adolescent mother. . . 1.3 times as likely to have no access to money for her own use. . . and 2.3 times as likely to report she has no say in how money is spent. Poverty and location also lead to significant variations within a country. On a crisp, sunny winter morning, 13-year-old Jahanara Alam was on her way to volleyball practice in Khulna, about 200 kilometres from Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka. Dressed in sports attire, she was spotted by a cricket coach and asked if she might be interested in the sport. It was 2006, and Bangladesh was about to assemble its first national women’s cricket team. Stunned into acceptance, Alam went into training.  Alam’s team went on to take silver at the 2010 Asian Games, and in 2018 pulled off a surprise win against defending champions India at the Women’s T20 Asia Cup. She was also the first Bangladeshi bowler to take a five-wicket haul in women’s T20 international cricket.  At the other end of the subcontinent, Urooj Mumtaz grew up playing cricket behind a carpet factory in Karachi, Pakistan. As a teen, she was captaining a boys’ team at the local club. “There still isn’t a girls’ team at the club,” Mumtaz told Nikkei Asia in an interview. In 2006, she went on to captain Pakistan’s national cricket team, and later became the country’s first woman to commentate on an international men’s match.

Basics such as airfare, accommodation and gear have been secured, but several innings remain to achieve pay parity.  “If the [men] are getting 100 per cent then we are getting maybe 30 to 40 per cent,” Alam said in an interview, noting the gap was narrower now than when they were making 5 to 10 per cent a decade ago. Mumtaz said there was a fivefold gender pay differential in the highest category of cricket in Pakistan.

 “When you get better facilities, when you pay them better . . . when you give them better travel, better hotels to stay at, everything translates into better results,” she said.  Several players and branding agencies have called on cricket boards to sharpen the spotlight on female cricketers via marketing campaigns. More fans would mean bigger television audiences and the promise of lucrative endorsement deals, which can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars for individual cricketers. India in October announced equal cricket match fees for women and men, following a similar edict by New Zealand in July. The move was cheered by many across the game, including legendary former Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar.  Yet for all the progress, the current system keeps producing similar results year after year: men outnumbering women in the most powerful and well-paid posts. One systemic reason is hiring. Human recruiters rely partly on professional networks, often dominated by men, while algorithmic recruiters rely on historical data that refer to prior people in those roles — also often men. Gendered structures and social conditioning can also disadvantage men, says Yen Do, a Vietnamese investor focused on gender equality. “Men also bear tremendous social biases, [that they] should be the sole or main breadwinners, should have enough money and assets to find a wife,” she said.  When top chip companies, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to Qualcomm, want to know what ails their integrated circuits, they call Dr Hsieh Yong-Fen. Taiwan’s first female PhD in materials science and engineering sees the business she founded, MA-tek, as a technical doctor that diagnoses problems in research, design and production. “There are no stereotypes and gender barriers in my company,” Hsieh said in an interview at her office in the chip hub town of Hsinchu, where she leads meetings by drawing colourful graphics on floor-to-ceiling whiteboards that blanket two walls. Hsieh Yong-Fen at MA-Tek’s headquarters in Hsinchu, Taiwan © Lai Yung HsiangInfo‘There are no stereotypes and gender barriers in my company’ Taiwan dominates the world’s supply of computer chips, which run everything from phones to laptops and cars. Nearly 30 per cent of MA-tek engineers are women in an industry striving for parity.  At TSMC, which accounts for more than half of the global market for contract chip fabrication, women make up 13 per cent of managers and 21 per cent of technical hires — still less than the company’s 2030 targets of 20 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. Over in Vietnam, where Intel has its largest global assembly site, 33 per cent of its technical staff are female. This is short of the 40 per cent it aims to have in five years.  Ho Thi Thu Uyen has been with Intel since it entered Vietnam in 2006, becoming the first Vietnamese senior manager at the US company, one of Ho Chi Minh City’s biggest exporters.   “When [girls] are in high school, we have student sessions, we invite them to tour the factory, we have female engineers talk to the students,” Uyen, now a public affairs director, told Nikkei Asia, adding there are internships and “a lot of support so that they feel more confident in choosing engineering and technology”. The semiconductor firms are starting to break past an event horizon. Research shows “when women make up at least 30 per cent of a particular [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] field, other women are drawn to that field . . . the belief being that the behaviours, interactions, and culture of the field have been influenced by women, and issues such as power dynamics and feelings of isolation are less problematic,” Roberta Rincon, associate director of research at the Society of Women Engineers, told Nikkei Asia. In addition to representation, studies show a correlation between reproductive rights and women’s wealth.  The impact of children depends, first, on a woman’s right to choose and, second, on the care available. Though abortion rights vary widely across Asia, they are relatively strong in some countries. The region accounts for nearly half of the world’s 73mn terminations a year, according to the Guttmacher Institute.  That stems in part from son preference. Yet it also reduces the odds of unintended pregnancies that force mothers to quit the workforce. Data from the World Bank also show that women in the region, on average, are having fewer children.  Yen Do, an investment manager at Beacon Fund, which backs female entrepreneurs, believes greater education and urbanisation are changing views about gender roles.  The Asian Development Bank puts urbanisation in the Asia-Pacific at 54 per cent, rising to 64 per cent by 2050. For one segment of the region’s working mothers, child care comes from an army of affordable domestic helpers; for another, it’s live-in grandparents. Three-generation households are more common in Asia and Africa than the rest of the world, according to the United Nations.  Capt Jul Laiza C Beran, the first female fighter pilot in the Philippine Air Force, will have help from a nanny and in-laws when she has a child next year. After maternity leave she’ll need to retrain, fly sorties with an instructor, and stay fit for a job with intense physical demands like withstanding gravitational force at high altitudes. Beran enlisted in the military after a childhood of midnight evacuations and pitched battles between the army and separatists in Cotabato province in the country’s south. “I wanted to take the road less travelled by women and prove that a woman could be a combat-ready pilot and man stealth aircraft,” she said. Capt Jul Laiza C Beran, the first female fighter pilot in the Philippine Air Force. © Cpt. C. BeranInfoNivedita and Niharika Bhasin, mother and daughter pilots  Info‘Well, it’s still called a cockpit’ Nivedita Bhasin was awed by aircraft she saw as a girl. In New Delhi, she’d stare out her classroom window, dreaming of flying the planes that soared past. One day, an algebra teacher hurled a piece of chalk at Bhasin and yelled, “Well, you’ll get a big zero if you keep looking out the window.”  Thirteen years later, in 1989, Capt Bhasin became the youngest woman in the world to command a commercial jet aircraft; she was 26. “It turned out that I had to look out the window. That’s the job, that’s how I earned my living,” she said. Bhasin reported back to work when each of her two children was six weeks old. “This is really heart-wrenching when I think of it now,” she said in an interview. Her airline had no rules about pregnancy; she was India’s first airline pilot to have given birth.  The country has the world’s highest proportion of female pilots, 12.5 per cent, the International Society of Women Airline Pilots estimates. Yet this is also a country that ranks 135 of 146 on the World Economic Forum’s ranking of nations based on gender parity. With 662mn women, India lags in overall labour force participation, healthcare, the female-to-male literacy ratio, income equality and representation in political, technical and leadership roles, the WEF said. But when it comes to taking to the skies, trailblazers like Bhasin say women pilots in India have benefited from active outreach, including state subsidies for expensive flight schools. Private companies, such as Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, provide full scholarships for 18-month training sessions and placement at commercial airlines. Capt Bhasin also credited the crucial role played by extended family and India’s cheap domestic labor in supporting her children while she spent years on grueling international flights.Her daughter Niharika is also a captain today, flying the Airbus A320 around the world for Indian carrier IndiGo. Women who show up on turf that had long been considered the preserve of men don’t always get a warm welcome. “Well, it’s still called a cockpit.” Capt Beran, who became a pilot 30 years later, has had a smoother ride. At first, air force protocol catered to men, from bathrooms to safety gear. But it adapted, and Beran now feels camaraderie with her male colleagues — important for the high-stakes, dangerous missions they execute together.   “It’s a very risky aircraft, fast and powerful,” she said. “All you can think about is performing a scramble or hitting the target or flying in formation. There’s pressure on your mind and body.”  Commuters may be used to hopping in a taxi to be greeted by a male driver, but more women are taking the wheel. Companies such as Thailand’s GrabCar for Ladies and India’s Hey Deedee delivery women fill a gap in the market. “From the safety point of view also, it is good to have female clients who, too, feel comfortable with a woman driver,” said Pooja, a taxi driver in New Delhi who goes by one name. She had stints driving for Uber, Ola and a private client, but moved to part-time work with the birth of a daughter in 2020. The gig economy has attracted women who say apps like ride-hailing or bTaskee, Vietnam’s odd jobs platform, allow freedom to set schedules around child care or other activities. This was the top motivation cited by Indonesians and Indians when polled by Uber for a 2018 report. In 2018, Grab reported an annual jump of more than 230 per cent in south-east Asian women drivers. But the pandemic has accentuated a long-running debate about whether flexibility, including remote and gig work, helps or harms women. “The platform economy tends to reproduce rather than overturn traditional gender roles, while adding extra working hours to women’s busy schedules,” said JustJobs Network’s Jamme.  Her research found that when women do gig jobs, they have less leisure time and lack access to healthcare, pensions, and training. The Friedrich Ebert Foundation’s 2020 report on women in Asian economies drew similar conclusions, suggesting: “Rethink the social-protection infrastructure to better include those who work from remote locations or in flexible work environments.” In Thailand, marketing professional and part-time Grab cab driver Suthamat drives for another kind of freedom: financial. “I’m a working girl. I don’t want to just stay home and do nothing,” she said, weaving her sedan through Bangkok’s gridlock. Her husband and sons encourage her to retire but she prefers to make money, enabled by independent contractors’ low barriers to entry. As women move into cities, they “get exposed to a freer life”, said Beacon’s Yen. That includes more freedom to work and absorb the urban marketplace of ideas, such as who can be an executive or an engineer or an athlete. As Suthamat and others accumulate savings, they are moving it into more financial products, prompting banks such as UBS and HSBC to introduce services for female clients.  Women who earn more than $75,000 a year and hold assets worth between $100,000 and $1mn, the mass affluent, are a high-growth target market. “Asia’s mass affluent women are becoming more financially savvy, confident and active in their investments” and “managing and growing their wealth more than ever before,” said Jenny Wang, head of premier wealth solutions at HSBC. The number of women in this category in Asia has risen 14 per cent since the pandemic started, she said. The ranks of women on the other side of the desk are also growing at banks like BDO in the Philippines and JPMorgan Asia. Women make up 30 per cent of the region’s wealth managers versus 10 per cent in Europe, says recruiting firm Korn Ferry. Wing Commander Namrita Chandi  Wing Commander Namrita Chandi was in the second batch of helicopter pilots allowed into the Indian Air Force and the first woman in her family to earn a pay cheque. While she felt no discrimination on the job, organisational policy lagged the times. Women were allowed only short-service commissions, so Wing Commander Chandi was forced to retire after serving for 15 years.  She moved to the courts, and after an eight-year fight, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the defence forces had to allow women to become permanently commissioned officers. Short-service officers miss out on benefits that lead to wealth, most notably a career path to the top and pensions. “This is for the next generation of women. I hope they can make a difference to humanity and a greater difference to the world.” The Indian Air Force allowed women fighter pilots as an “experimental scheme” in 2016, and announced this year it would make the move permanent.  Institutional structures are being questioned in sports, too. “Men make a lot of money from endorsements, from sponsorships, from commercial activities and franchise cricket. That’s where probably the biggest buck is,” Mumtaz said. “All the years that I played cricket I actually put in money as opposed to getting back or getting paid.” Pakistan and Bangladesh plan to launch women’s professional leagues next year, bringing women a step closer to groups like the Indian Premier League for men, which has drawn players and profits to the sport.  They would also highlight inequality in professional sports, including limited female coaching roles, media coverage, investment and opportunities for advancement.  Across industries, merit is not always enough to overcome incumbent advantage. In a survey of 2,000 people across Asia by recruiter Hays, 60 per cent said leaders had a “bias toward hiring” and promoting “people who look, think or act like them.” Many studies have shown that female and minority candidates’ odds improve when recruiters use anonymous résumés and that diversity correlates with business performance.

"Interest rates, bank crises and your money","What does turmoil in the banking sector mean for interest rates?","This is an audio transcript of the Money Clinic podcast episode: ‘Interest rates, bank crises and your money’ [MUSIC PLAYING] Claer Barrett Banks.

A bank, I’m willing to bet, most outside of the tech world had never heard of before it went belly up. And then came the fallout. Because if there’s one thing about bank collapses, it’s that they have ripple effects across the financial industry.  News clip 5 The troubled global banking sector . . .

News clip 7 A major sell-off of shares in the Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse.  News clip 8 The Swiss bank has seen its shares tumble this week with billions of dollars wiped off its market value.  News clip 9 A historic moment for Credit Suisse and for global finance.  Claer Barrett Welcome to Money Clinic, the weekly podcast from the Financial Times about personal finance and investing. I’m Claer Barrett, the FT’s consumer editor. The wild ride in bank shares that we’ve been seeing recently is down to rising interest rates. Central banks have been fighting inflation by putting up key rates, but those increases have happened very quickly and that’s put some financial institutions under stress. It means central banks now face a dilemma. How can they keep up the fight against inflation without causing more financial turmoil? So in this episode, we’re asking what’s next for interest rates? How worried should we be about the stability of the global financial system? And of course, what does it all mean for your investments?  I spoke to Money Clinic regular, the FT’s markets editor Katie Martin. And down the line from New York, the FT’s financial reporter and author of the Unhedged newsletter, Ethan Wu. Now, we recorded this episode at the end of last week before the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse had been finalised. But the themes of this episode relating to investing and your money still stand. I started by asking Ethan to give us a brief rundown of what happened with SVB.   Ethan Wu Well, do you want the short story or the long story?  Claer Barrett Start with the short one. (chuckles) Ethan Wu Well, the short one is that, you know, a bank has two sides. Money goes in and money goes out. And in this case, SVB, the money went out from both ends. That’s the short story. The long story has to do with interest rates. And so, you know, the main thing to understand about SVB is the S and the V — Silicon Valley, right? It’s taking deposits from Silicon Valley start-ups. So they have all of this cash from these companies. They got this influx of money. Those companies are highly interest-rate sensitive. They have funding because interest rates are at zero, because the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the US, lowered rates to stimulate the economy after the pandemic. So that’s on the money-coming-in side. On the other side of the bank, you know, a bank got a lot of money. You got to put it somewhere. Most banks usually like to lend that out, right? That’s the main business they’re in. But in the case of SVB, they got so much money so quickly that they decided, “You know what, we’re going to do something prudent, safe, conservative. We’re going to put it in US government bonds. The safest stuff there is.” The one problem (chuckles) with that plan is that US government bonds are also highly interest rate sensitive. When interest rates go up, the price of the bond goes down. So what you had in the last year or so is interest rates in the US going up the fastest they’ve gone up in decades. So SVB got pinched on both sides. Its depositors, all these tech firms who had all this money from the era of low interest rates, they started saying, “Oh, it’s looking tough out there. We’re going to need to, you know, start withdrawing our money.” On the other side, all the bonds SVB had, they were rapidly losing value. And so we got in a situation where people started getting concerned in Silicon Valley, “Hey, are they going to be able to pay us back? Given what’s happening to the bond side of their portfolio.” And you know, add one more thing into this, which is all the people in Silicon Valley are in the same group chats. They’re all talking to one another. They’re all reading the same sub stacks, they’re all reading Twitter. They all got panicked in a herd and they ran for the door and it was too late for SVB.  Claer Barrett Yeah, I mean, the speed that it unravelled was just absolutely phenomenal. Well, Katie, we’ve survived (chuckles) the last seven days or so of reporting on this story.  Katie Martin So far.  Claer Barrett So far. (chuckles) There’s been a lot of ups and downs. But tell us briefly what the market reaction has been to all of this.  Katie Martin Yes. It’s been pretty spectacular. I mean, at first, you know, SVB started to look like it was in the death throes. And all of the investors that we spoke to on this side of the pond were saying, “Don’t worry, don’t panic. This is just some little bank in the States. It’s got very specific problems. It’s got itself in quite the tangle over here.” Because as Ethan says, it was getting hit on both sides. “This is not systemic. There’s nothing to worry about here.” And then a couple of days later, suddenly the market decided there was something to worry about here and it accelerated pretty quickly. One thing was that regional bank stocks in the States, first of all, just got hosed. They had a really hard time because people were thinking, well, which bank is next? Which is going next? The thing that had a bigger impact for portfolios for everybody else was that the market decided, huh? We’ve always known that if the Fed slams on the brakes and starts jacking up interest rates, something’s going to go through the windshield. Here’s the thing that’s going through the windshield: it’s the US banking system. You know, panic. So US government bonds, which are supposed to be the safe place where you can go, the sort of safe hidey hole for investors. They rocketed higher. Firstly because people were looking for safety. Also because people were saying, “Ha, I don’t think the Fed can keep on hiking quite as aggressively as it has been doing over the past year anymore.” And so suddenly you had bond prices picking up. Now, the problem there is that pretty much every hedge fund on the street has been massively betting against government bonds because they made a fortune last year out of betting that the Fed would raise rates. And they thought in 2023, what’s changed? We’re going to keep that bet on. So it took a fairly small move in the opposite direction for this to accelerate incredibly quickly. Suddenly, we ended up with the biggest rally in US government bonds since 1987. If you look at the bond market alone, it tells you this past couple of weeks has been worse than ‘08. Worse than March 2020. Just a kind of generationally terrible week in the markets. Now, I think that’s exaggerated on the bond market side, that the stock market will tell you that it hasn’t been quite so bad, but it has been a really violent move.  Ethan Wu And Claer, just to add on to Katie’s very comprehensive answer, I think when we talk about government bonds being safe, you know, that word kind of obscures a distinction that I think people are, you know, learning really matters here. So one type of risk you want to be safe from is credit risk. That’s the risk that people default, that you’re holding the bond, the debt of a company or government or whatever that goes under. Government bonds are entirely safe from that type of risk. You know, historically speaking, developed countries, they just don’t default. It doesn’t happen. There’s another type of risk, which is interest rate risk. Now, this is not your bond goes to zero. This is your bond loses 20 to 30 per cent of its value because rates have gone up really fast. Now, that’s in some ways less catastrophic because it’s not going to zero. So people have, I think, not thought as much about, you know, interest rate risk as, you know, a major threat to bonds or at least sort of maybe in the popular cautiousness of government bonds being the safe place to go. But when we talk about safe, we’re talking about safe from default, not safe from losses on value of the bond.  Claer Barrett A very, very good point. And it wasn’t just SVB that has had problems in the past week. It’s also been very dramatic over on the European banking scene. Credit Suisse, lots of drama there, as well as other bank stocks around the world.  Ethan Wu Yeah. And I think part of the, you know, quote unquote contagion, the jumping of distress from SVB to Credit Suisse and First Republic in the US and, you know, various other banks in the US and Europe is that, you know, people have been asking, what’s the link here? I think there is something to be said about, you know, fear when it takes over markets. It is an incredibly powerful force and it doesn’t need a rationale. If you’re scared, you’re scared. Right? And which isn’t to say that Credit Suisse doesn’t have problems, but Credit Suisse did not have the same problem that SVB did. Right? SVB had this kind of, again, dual interest rate sensitivity on both sides of the bank. Credit Suisse was just kind of a poorly run business that had, you know, a bunch of scandals in the last couple of years. But what they share in common, right, is management incompetence leading to worsening profits. And then in a climate of fear, when everyone’s scared of, you know, are people going to start withdrawing? Am I going to get my money back? Those profitability concerns can morph through the prism of fear into something more existential for the banks.  Claer Barrett Mm-hmm. And certainly there have been some weird and unexpected movements (chuckles) elsewhere on the markets. The price of bitcoin actually surged 30 per cent last week. I mean, Katie, what’s all that’s about? (laughter).  Katie Martin I mean . . . (laughter) Ethan Wu What is that about? (laughter) Katie Martin You tell me, Claer. The thing is with the crypto crowd is that if bitcoin is up one week, they’re telling you that’s because it’s a flight to safety. The next week they’re telling you people are looking for a new speculative asset. The next time they’re telling you it’s because they want an alternative to the dollar brackets question mark. So why is it up? I don’t really know. But I do know that had SVB been allowed to fail in the sense that it’s depositors have been left with nothing or they’d only been left as much as the federal insurance covers them for, then the crypto industry would have been in a lot of trouble because there’s this thing called a stablecoin, which is supposedly pegged one for one with the dollar, which is run by a company called Circle. It had a cool $3.3bn on deposit with SVB and you’re only insured up to 250K. Now, as it turns out, the regulatory response to all this and the rescue package that they came out with said that, “OK, all the depositors are made whole. Don’t worry, you can get your money back.”  Claer Barrett Mmm. And they were very fast too.  Katie Martin They were super fast to do that. But there’s a very real sense in which the authorities in the States have stepped in and bailed out the crypto market here, which I mean, beats me.  Claer Barrett Mm-hmm. And I mean, certainly in the UK there were just over 3,000 UK fast-growing tech companies mostly who did bank with the UK arm of SVB, and that was taken over very rapidly by HSBC.  Katie Martin Yes. HSBC paid a whole pound for that business. So that again, is effectively a rescue. And again, it’s a bit of a lesson in does it make sense for banks to be heavily concentrated on one industry or does it make more sense for them to be more of a full service bank like HSBC, where you can just spread that risk around so that if the tech industry hits a wall, it doesn’t take the bank down with it. If you could cope with my tangled analogy there.  Claer Barrett OK. Well, this story obviously continues to run and run, so keep up with FT.com for the latest. Let’s just pause for breath a minute now, Katie and Ethan, and let’s talk now about what all of this is potentially going to do to the future direction of interest rates. Now, listeners will know that raising rates is the main tool that central banks around the world have to fight inflation. But they’re walking a tightrope. If they raise rates too far, too fast, there’s a risk that economies could be plunged into recession. And of course, there’s all of these hidden risks potentially buried in bank balance sheets that could emerge. Now, it’s easy to understand why interest rates matter on financial products like savings accounts. But Ethan, why do they matter so much to retail investors and the value of the investments that we hold in our portfolios?  Ethan Wu Mm-hmm. Yes. So interest rates matter for basically every investing asset out there. And that’s because, you know, interest rates, I think, are best thought of as the price of money. Which means, you know, basically every asset when you if you’re a financial professional, you’ve got your spreadsheet out and you’re deciding how much you want to pay for a stock, a key input into your valuation of a stock or a bond or whatever it is, is going to be what the prevailing interest rate is, what you can get, you know, the return you can get on your money for no risk at all.  Claer Barrett If I can get 4 per cent in my cash Isa, why would I risk investing in something that I think is going to potentially yield me less than that?  Ethan Wu Exactly. Yeah. No, when rates are high, equities better return quite a bit more or what’s the point? You know, So in general, when interest rates rise, stocks tend to do poorly. That’s not necessarily in iron law. And there’s, you know, plenty of wiggle room and variation around that. But that’s kind of a general relationship. You know, in the past year, it’s been quite bad for stocks and for bonds. It’s been, you know, really perilous investing climate for both retail investors and for the professionals. But I think now that interest rate increases are starting to level off inflation, you know, hasn’t been dealt with yet. But there are some hopeful signs that one might be optimistic about. I think that there’s a climate for savers where you can put your money away in a certificate of deposit for a year or two. If you need a short-term access to your funds, get four and a half per cent risk free. Don’t bother about “Is there going to be a recession? Will that hurt my equity portfolio?” Of course, if you’re a longer term investor, the best thing to do is almost always to buy and hold stocks for long periods of time. Right now is a decent entry point in global equities. They’re cheap by historical standards. US equities a little bit less so. Those are a little more expensive than historical standards. You know, if you’re a recent graduate or just getting into investing, it’s not the worst time to buy equities for the long run either.  Claer Barrett No. And we always encourage people to take a long-term view, as regular listeners will know. Now, Katie, how else could rising interest rates impact our personal finances? I suppose the big question for lots of us sitting here who are lucky enough to own our own homes is what it will do to mortgage rates.  Katie Martin I’ve got one year until I renew my mortgage. I’m really hoping this whole thing blows over by that (laughter), otherwise I’m going to be paying through the nose. Yeah, I mean, Brits in particular are very sensitive to this stuff because our mortgages roll over every couple of years as a rule, and the interest rate can kick up pretty severely in that period. So there’s a lot of people now who are rolling over mortgages that they’ve been paying reasonably happily without too much difficulty for a really long time that suddenly is getting some real sticker shock in terms of the price of renewing that debt. So that’s probably the main channel for Brits at the moment. The cost of borrowing has gone up enormously. Whether that is for a home or whether it is just any other standard loan. So a lot is hinging on central banks’ ability to get inflation down. And you know, these are the trade offs. You know, there are going to be fragilities in the financial system that are going to be things that go wrong if they’ve been hinging absolutely on interest rates staying low forever. So central banks have got to tread that line.  Claer Barrett Mmm. Ethan, we’ve got some key events coming up, haven’t we, this week? The Fed meeting to decide interest rates. I mean, even quite recently, I think the FT’s front page splash on the 8th of March was that the Fed was going to go harder and raise interest rates further than the market was anticipating. I mean, so much changes and so few days.  Ethan Wu It does. I did think what was interesting recently was the European Central Bank did stick with raising rates by half a percentage point, which I think tells us something. It tells us that central banks really are committed to stamping out inflation with interest rate hikes. Now, you know, part of the reporting on the ECB decision was that the bank was considering either half a percentage point or nothing at all. There was no consideration of slowing down. It’s either we’re going to pause to see how the financial system is doing or we’re going to, you know, stick on our campaign against inflation. Obviously, the stress in the financial sector complicates the picture for the banks. They now have to balance, you know, two risks that kind of point in opposite directions, right? One being financial stability, you know, one being combating inflation. Now, I think the UK example from last year, the gilts market crisis that the Bank of England had had to stamp out.  Claer Barrett Mm-hmm. Yes, of course, talking about what happened after the disastrous mini-Budget where Liz Truss said that she was going to borrow huge sums of money for completely unfunded tax cuts and investors around the world were completely spooked and the cost of UK government borrowing went up because people thought Britain was much more risky and that completely repriced government bonds known as gilts and caused all kinds of issues everywhere from the stock market to the health of pension funds. A complete disaster.  Ethan Wu Yeah, that’s right. Gilts being UK government bonds, just like in the US. Supposed to be the safest sort of debt in the UK. You know what happened in that situation was the Bank of England, it took a little break a couple of weeks, maybe a month, from tightening monetary policy to deal with the ructions in the gilt market. And it was successful because it has basically unlimited firepower to deal with financial market turmoil. Once it stamped that out, it pivoted back and said, “Hey guys, we’re going back to our inflation-fighting campaign.” You know, I think the ECB and the Fed are going to be looking at the Bank of England’s example of being able to separate the tools of financial stability and monetary policy. Financial stability is a near-term concern. You don’t have to, you know, deal with it forever. You have to deal with it in episodic periods when people get stressed out. And fighting inflation can be kind of a longer term priority that can be combated over time, even if you have to take these, you know, momentary breaks. But if things calm down, I would expect the central banks to go right back to raising rates because fundamentally, they have not won the inflation battle yet.  Katie Martin Ethan’s absolutely right. And the really difficult thing for monetary policymakers now for, you know, the bigwigs sitting in central banks is they mustn’t look frightened. If you know, for example, had the European Central Bank said, “Look, we’re not going to do a half percentage point rate rise as we have indicated that we would. We’re going to go smaller or we’re going to do nothing at all.” Then the market would have thought, “Ha, well, if they’re worried about the European banking system, then maybe I should be more worried about the European banking system.” And so there’s going to be a very difficult communication job now, where it’s been it’s been difficult from the start that central banks don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They don’t want to break the system while they try and fix inflation. But at the same time, they really have to manage expectations and not look like they’re spooked. Otherwise this whole situation will get worse. So I really don’t envy them. I would be surprised if the Bank of England manages to get away with the next rate-setting meeting on the 23rd without being forced to say something about this whole situation. Thankfully, at the moment UK banks are not in the firing line of this and if we could all just keep it that way, then that would really help my stress levels.  Claer Barrett (Chuckles) It certainly would, wouldn’t it? But Ethan, what the Fed decides on interest rates that really matters, whether you’re an investor sitting in the US, in the UK or even India, for example, it’s the most watched market.  Ethan Wu Yeah, that’s right. Economically, the Fed sets the tempo for interest rates all across the world. But I think something important to say there is that the Fed tends not to make interest rate policy consciously for the rest of the world. They make it for the US. Right? These are US policymakers. They’re accountable to Congress. They talk to international central banks. But that’s not really their key constituency. So I think, you know, just like it’s been almost the entire interest rate cycle, the Fed’s going to be making decisions based on US inflation, US financial stability, not necessarily European financial stability or, you know, balance of payment crises in the developing world. It makes no decisions.  Claer Barrett Now, I’m going to come to both of you to close. Obviously, this is a very fast-moving story. But starting with you, Ethan, what will you be watching in the days and weeks to come?  Ethan Wu Mmm. One thing I’ve been watching is funding stress, essentially, you know, how much stress is out there? How much are banks having to borrow from the government to cover liquidity needs, to cover, you know, withdrawals from the bank. I’m on the lookout for if there’s going to be another failure or if authorities have really stemmed the bleeding and contain the fallout. I am hopeful at this juncture. I think there are reasons to think that we are not going to have a 2008 or even short of 2008-style meltdown, that this is a temporary stress that can be smoothed out. Now of course, as Katie referred to, when interest rates go up, things do tend to break. So in some ways, you know, it’s not surprising and we should expect more. But at least for now, in the interim, I think that keep an eye on the banking system, but I think there’s not necessarily reason to completely panic and sell everything and board up of your home.  Claer Barrett Well, I’m relieved to hear that.  Ethan Wu Yes.  Claer Barrett And Katie, what will you be watching out for in the days and weeks to come?  Katie Martin For what it’s worth, I am with Ethan on this. I’m not going out to buy guns and tin food. I don’t think, famous last words, I don’t think this is an ‘08 situation. It’s very difficult to see how it could be. So the thing I’m going to be really watching over the next few days is the government bond market to try and figure out how much of the move that we’ve seen over the past few days is an overreaction and how much of it is a realistic reflection of what central banks are likely to do next?  Claer Barrett Brilliant. Well, thank you so much to Katie Martin, the FT’s markets editor, and Ethan Wu.

"JPMorgan’s internal feud over wealthy clients","JPMorgan Chase financial advisers are fighting over who should manage some of the bank’s wealthiest clients. The FT’s US banking editor Joshua Franklin breaks down the infighting","This is an audio transcript of the Behind the Money podcast episode: ‘JPMorgan’s internal feud over wealthy clients’ Michela Tindera Hey, American listeners, we at the FT wanna get to know you a bit better. So we’re looking for some US-based listeners to join a focus group to tell us what you like about FT podcasts and what you wanna hear more of. You can volunteer for this by filling out a quick survey and you can find the link for that in this episode’s show notes. Thanks, everybody.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Take a second and think about how you keep track of your money today. Maybe you have your bank’s mobile app on your phone or use a stock trading app like Robinhood. Or maybe once a year, an accountant helps you out with your taxes. But the FT’s US banking editor Josh Franklin says that when people are really wealthy, you know, like really wealthy, things are different.  Joshua Franklin They have more needs that need to be met, more money that needs to be managed, things like putting their money into asset management funds or helping them with their tax matters or, you know, just doing regular stock trading, inheritance planning, trust and estate planning, things like that.  Michela Tindera Now, this includes people like Alex Rodriguez or, you know, A-Rod. The former all-star baseball player earned an estimated $400mn over the course of his decades-long career in the MLB. And since he retired in 2016, he’s continued to earn a lot.  Joshua FranklinHe has a Spac, a special purpose acquisition company. He’s trying to become a bit of a private equity investor. So I think he has ambitions for himself in terms of what he can accomplish.  Michela TinderaAnd that’s all to say that Alex Rodriguez, retired baseball star, investor, entrepreneur, is a very attractive potential client for banks who regularly work with wealthy people like himself. In fact, the allure of A-Rod’s wealth has led to infighting at one of the world’s biggest banks, JPMorgan.  Joshua Franklin It’s a battle between two separate businesses at JPMorgan over who gets to manage the money for certain wealthy and famous clients. And at the centre of that is this financial adviser named Gwen Campbell. And she’s accused her colleagues of trying to go after her clients, but with Alex Rodriguez, the main target.   Michela Tindera Now this bitter conflict has included allegations of a broken contract, a restraining order and arbitration proceedings. And it’s recently spilled out into the open, showcasing the cut-throat competition for clients among divisions at a major bank.  [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. On today’s episode of Behind the Money: how acquisitions can lead to internal divisions in the banking industry.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Josh, welcome back to Behind the Money. Thanks so much for being here.  Joshua Franklin Thanks very much.   Michela TinderaOK, Josh, let’s start with the basics here. We’re talking about a conflict happening at one of the biggest banks in the world, JPMorgan Chase. And this conflict involves two of JPMorgan’s businesses that have very similar names. So what are they and how are they different?  Joshua Franklin Both businesses are involved in offering wealth management services to high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients. Let’s start with the bigger one.  Michela TinderaOK. And that’s called JPMorgan private bank.  Joshua Franklin And that has an army of about 27 hundred private bankers who help manage the money for wealthy clients. Whoever the client is, they have a relationship with the private bank as a whole. You have your main banker, but you’ll be dealing with many different people across the private bank. So it can be something like you have one person at JPMorgan Private Bank who’s helping you with your stock market portfolio, and another who’s more responsible for your tax and estate planning and things like that.  Michela Tindera OK, sure. And what about the other one?  Joshua FranklinThe JPMorgan Advisors, they have about 450 financial advisers, of which Gwen Campbell is one. And they’re really the main person that you’re dealing with. You’re not so much a client of JPMorgan as you are a client of your financial adviser. They are doing, you know, upwards of 90 per cent of the face to face with the client.  Michela Tindera OK. To reiterate, you have JPMorgan Private Bank, which is a division where one client works with a number of different people across JPMorgan. And then you have JPMorgan Advisors where the client really only interacts with their one wealth adviser. So do these two different units ever interact with each other?  Joshua Franklin So in theory, they are all colleagues. They all work for JPMorgan. But the relationship is very, very complicated. And it’s been complicated for a long time now, because you’ve essentially got two different business models and two different businesses at the bank doing the same thing. And at times they’re pitching for the same clients and often coming up against each other, trying to, trying to win that business. And it’s not a harmonious relationship all the time.  Michela TinderaSo why is the bank organised like this?  Joshua FranklinThat is a very good question. And the root reason why is that it’s a result of the way the modern-day JPMorgan Chase has been built. It’s a culmination of several different mergers over many decades. And the JPMorgan Advisors business, that’s really the old Bear Stearns financial advisory business that JPMorgan acquired back in 2008 during the financial crisis.  Michela TinderaAnd then remind us, what happened with Bear Stearns? Joshua FranklinSo Bear Stearns was an investment bank and a Wall Street broker that was one of the early dominoes to fall during the 2008 financial crisis. And it ended up being acquired by JPMorgan in a deal that was orchestrated by the US government to bail out Bear Stearns, essentially. So it wasn’t exactly a longtime-planned acquisition from JPMorgan. It’s a bit of a shotgun acquisition, a shotgun marriage for JPMorgan and Bear Stearns. And 14 years on since JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns, they’re still having teething problems with integrating this business. So that’s why you have this internal competition in the way that you do and that JPMorgan has this legacy big private bank and then this newer, you know, adviser business that they acquired through the Bear Stearns acquisition. And they’re running up against each other.  Michela Tindera OK. And bringing us up more to the present day, these two businesses at JPMorgan are now stuck in this dispute. So tell us more about Gwen Campbell. Who is she?  Joshua Franklin Yes, she is a longtime financial adviser, featured on many, you know, top 100 financial adviser lists from a number of publications. She has also worked at some of the biggest banks in the world. She worked at Goldman Sachs, UBS and Merrill Lynch before she ended up at JPMorgan and really is well known for, you know, advocating for her client getting the best deal that they can from the banks that she’s working for.  Michela Tindera OK. And in 2020, she left her job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and came over to work at JPMorgan in this wealth advisers business.  Joshua Franklin So this was a really prized hire. And the reason why, a big reason why they wanted to hire her was because of the clients that she had. Alex Rodriguez is one of her most prominent clients, but she also had a number of other wealthy clients. And her overall book of business that she ended up bringing over to JPMorgan when she moved from Merrill Lynch was about $1.4bn in assets and loans.  Michela TinderaWell, that all sounds swell. What does Gwen Campbell allege went wrong?  Joshua FranklinSo, the seeds to this drama were laid even before Gwen Campbell ended up starting in October of 2020. She’d already had reservations and worries about JPMorgan’s private bank, maybe, you know, trying to work with her clients in a way that she wouldn’t welcome. And so she actually raised those concerns to JPMorgan before she was hired and had a side letter to her employment contract, basically stating that the approach to dealing with her clients that she also shared with the private bank would be to have a kind of status quo arrangement where the dynamics wouldn’t change. And then shortly after she joined, she found that that agreement that she’d had in place wasn’t being honoured. And she’s argued that the private bank has tried to solicit her clients for business.  Michela TinderaSo essentially what she’s saying here is that the bank didn’t follow what was agreed upon in this side letter that was part of her employment contract. So what does she allege the JPMorgan Private Bank has done that’s breached her contract?  Joshua FranklinSo she’s alleged that the bank, the private bank has sought to undermine her in front of her clients, badmouthed her behind her back and also offered loans to her clients in a bid to take more of the, more of their assets from Gwen Campbell at JPMorgan Advisors to the private bank. And in all of this, Alex Rodriguez has really emerged as the main target of the private bank in Gwen Campbell’s telling of this. He seems to be the client that JPMorgan’s private bank has most targeted and gone after.  Michela Tindera So we should add in here that, according to Josh’s reporting, representatives for Alex Rodriguez did not respond to requests for comment about these events. OK. And what’s Gwen Campbell been doing about all of this?  Joshua FranklinSo it’s, this kind of spilled out into the public in December of last year. So almost 12 months ago when Gwen Campbell took the first of what’s now been several actions against JPMorgan. So she actually filed a, for a restraining order in California court against JPMorgan, asking a judge to put in place the restraining order so that the bank would not interact with any of her clients. This request was ultimately rejected by the California court. But through that, there was court filings that really did outline a lot of Gwen Campbell’s complaints and grievances.  Michela Tindera OK. And then what’s happening now with all this?  Joshua Franklin The main one that’s still ongoing is the arbitration proceedings, proceedings seeking financial damages for breach of contract by JPMorgan, which will be used to decide whether or not JPMorgan needs to pay financial damages to Gwen Campbell for breach of contract. And the contract that Gwen Campbell is claiming the bank breached is this agreement that she had when she joined JPMorgan that the bank would not try to change the relationship that she already had with her clients. And all the while, she’s still a JPMorgan employee working for the bank in San Francisco.  Michela TinderaWow. So we should probably point out that something sort of similar happened at JPMorgan just earlier this year. Can you tell us what happened there?  Joshua FranklinThere was another dispute that didn’t involve Gwen Campbell, about which part of the bank — whether or not JPMorgan Private Bank or JPMorgan Advisors — should manage money for a client who had recently inherited a very significant fortune, hundreds of millions of dollars from a relative. And there was, again, another turf war between the two sides. And I was told it got pretty ugly. And in the end, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, ended up intervening personally and said to both sides, “look, we don’t have the market share for these kinds of turf wars. Figure it out”. And in the end, in that case, it was left up to the client to decide which part of the bank they wanted to work with.  Michela Tindera So then why isn’t Jamie Dimon intervening here to resolve this issue?  Joshua Franklin It’s an excellent question. I can really only speculate, but in this case, I would suspect what’s complicating matters is the ongoing litigation and arbitration proceedings in Gwen Campbell’s case, which make things more complicated for someone like Jamie Dimon to get involved.  Michela Tindera Is this having any sort of impact on JPMorgan’s business, financially speaking? Joshua FranklinWhat’s interesting about both of these business — JPMorgan Private Bank and JPMorgan Advisors — they’re both so-called growth initiatives for JPMorgan. Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan executives publicly have talked a lot about how much they wanna grow in these areas. So JPMorgan Advisors, they have about 450 financial advisers right now. They’ve talked publicly about more than doubling that in the next few years. The private bank as well is trying to hire many private bankers to attract new assets, expand in other parts of the United States. So they’re both growth areas. So it . . . but it’s not a great advert for the dynamic of the business when you’ve got this hanging over.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela TinderaOK. Well, we should say here that a JPMorgan spokeswoman provided a statement to the FT that said that the bank has been putting significant focus and investments into JPMorgan Advisors — that’s Gwen Campbell’s part of the firm. The statement went on to say that they’ve put in place rules that, quote, “allow us to bring clients the expertise they need while ensuring that they and our financial professionals are treated fairly”, end quote.  So, Josh, what do you think this sort of conflict says about the banking industry? I mean, you know, as we discussed, the history of this JPMorgan Advisors is that it was an acquisition from Bear Stearns after the financial crisis.  Joshua Franklin It shows how difficult it is to manage these enormous institutions. JPMorgan is, you know, the biggest US bank by assets. So the kind of toughest case. But it really does show since the 2008 financial crisis, the biggest US banks have only gotten bigger in terms of assets and in terms of operations as they’ve gone into more and more activities. So they’re just very, very hard to manage.  Michela TinderaAnd why is it so hard to do?  Joshua Franklin With almost any acquisition, one of the biggest hurdles to clear is whether or not there’s a cultural fit between the two businesses. So there’s such strong cultural attachment to these places, to the brands that they come from. So even at Bank of America, there was such a strong attachment from, to the Merrill Lynch brand, to the people who had kind of grown up in that business. And that’s been a kind of rocky thing, as, as Bank of America has kind of, you know, pushed to one side the Merrill Lynch branch to focus more on Bank of America.  Michela TinderaAnd what’s next for Gwen Campbell and her fight?  Joshua FranklinWe’ll see whether or not we make it all the way to arbitration proceedings in July of next year. Or if the bank wants to just pay some money to try to make this go away if that’s possible. As we reported, Gwen Campbell did write a letter to JPMorgan’s board of directors in April, which we saw a copy of. And she said to the board that continued litigation was not her preference and that she wanted to have what she saw as the terms of her employment contract honoured. But she said that if that was not possible, there was the option to part ways and to resolve the matter in a way that, for her money, reflected the value of the billion-dollar book that she brought with her to JPMorgan when she joined.  Michela TinderaWell, Josh, thank you so much for being on the show again.  Joshua FranklinAh no, it was absolute pleasure. Thanks very much for having me on.

"UK economists’ survey: ‘miserable’ year ahead for households","Full responses to the Financial Times’ annual questionnaire","UK households face a “miserable” 2023, according to a majority of leading economists, who forecast that the country will experience a worse recession than most other advanced economies.  Many of the more than 100 experts who responded to an annual Financial Times questionnaire predicted a fall in real incomes, a drop in house prices, and rises in unemployment and borrowing costs this year. Four preferred to comment anonymously. High inflation, now running at 10.7 per cent, is expected to linger for longer than elsewhere as the UK underperforms most other advanced economies amid high energy prices, a shrinking workforce and stronger interest rates.   While many economists anticipated a weak recovery from the end of the year, the impact of Brexit and poor investment growth are expected to affect the UK’s longer-term economic performance, reducing its prospects for growth and living standards.  Here are the full responses to questions about the economic outlook for 2023. UK economy: Will the UK economy outpace or lag behind other developed economies in 2023 and how will it feel for households? Silvia Ardagna, head of European economics at Barclays: Lag behind the US but contract together with the euro area. We forecast a five-quarter recession with peak-to-trough contraction in real gross domestic product of about 1 per cent. Households’ consumption is contracting and is the main determinant of the recession. Kate Barker, pension trustee at BCSSS: The UK likely to lag other economies — productivity growth seems unlikely to pick up. Households without savings from the Covid-19 period and especially those with mortgages will continue to struggle. Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics at London School of Economics (LSE): Growth in the UK will be below the average for the G7 and EU. Households will feel the effects acutely: the second year of poor economic performance coming on top of falling real pay in 2022 will adversely affect living standards both in reality and perception. Ray Barrell, emeritus professor of economics and finance at Brunel University: UK growth is likely to lag other developed economies in 2023. The shadow of Brexit will continue to reduce growth by up to half a per cent a year for two or three more years. Unwise short-term actions combined with poor long-term planning over the last 10 years leave the UK more vulnerable to shocks than other developed countries. We lack the social insurance of large gas stocks. Uncertainty about the wisdom of policymakers will persist after the [Liz] Truss experiment. Encouraging public sector strikes raises uncertainty, but it is probably the last bid for middle-class votes by a failing government. All hinder growth prospects and will impact on household living standards. Real disposable incomes are likely to continue to fall next year.  Charlie Bean, professor of economics at LSE: Lag, as I fear inflation will prove to be somewhat more persistent here, necessitating a continued period of weak/negative growth and rising unemployment. This is mainly a reflection of the huge external energy and food price shock, but also of the substantial rise in inactivity as a result of the pandemic, which meant that the labour market was unsustainably tight even in the absence of the Ukraine shock. In any case, households will in all likelihood continue to see falling real incomes for some while yet. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club: The economic headwinds facing the UK — high inflation, expensive energy, falling real incomes and depressed consumer and business confidence — are shared by most other advanced economies. So we don’t think there’s any major reason why the UK economy should markedly underperform its peers. That UK GDP has recovered more slowly than elsewhere from the pandemic offers more room for catch-up growth and offers one potential source of outperformance. But much depends on the labour market and whether the rise in inactivity over the last few years, which has been less of a feature in other countries, reverses. David Bell, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Stirling: Lag behind. Households will continue to feel the effect of declining real wages throughout 2023. Inflation will fall sharply as recession bites so long as there is no repeat of recent supply-side shocks. The decline in real household incomes will moderate, but will continue into 2024. Those at the lower end of the income distribution and those who experience a sharp increase in mortgage payments will be particularly affected. Negative equity, not seen since the early 1990s, is a real possibility. Aveek Bhattacharya, research director at the Social Market Foundation: The consensus among forecasters seems to be that the UK economy will perform less well than peer countries in the year ahead. With incomes failing to keep up with inflation, the year ahead is likely to feel incredibly tough for many — perhaps most — households. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast of a 7 per cent cumulative decline in real household income over the next two years is unlike anything most of us have seen or remembered in this country. Danny Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College and former member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee: The UK is likely to be in a deep recession through all of 2023 and likely will be the worst performing country in the G7. Philip Booth, professor of finance, public policy and ethics at St. Mary’s University, Twickenham: It will feel grim for households. We have had a genuine episode of inflation caused by monetary laxity combined with a supply shock. It is the reality of the supply shock which means that living standards will fall and wage increases will remain behind price increases. Towards the end of 2023, things could improve. There is unlikely to be another energy supply shock and the current one may reverse.  Andrew Brigden, chief economist at Fathom Consulting: The UK is likely to be in the bottom half of the table when it comes to growth across the major economies in 2023. The UK looks to have entered a recession during the second half of this year, with activity peaking in the spring. The economy is likely to continue to contract for much, if not all, of next year. As a more substantial net importer of energy, the euro area is more directly exposed to the consequences of the war in Ukraine, and yet the UK faces its own headwinds from Brexit and from a fall in participation, particularly among older age groups, both of which have reduced potential supply. The US is likely to be at or near the top of the tree and may even escape recession. It will be a difficult year for UK households. Consumer confidence is already at or close to historic lows, and that is before unemployment has started to rise, and before any material fall in house prices. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura: We see a year-and-a-half-long recession in the UK having started in the third quarter of 2022, with growth only resuming again from early 2024. Our peak to trough in UK GDP is around 2 per cent. We see a contraction of 1.5 per cent in GDP in full-year 2023, which is similar to our euro area forecast but weaker than our US view. Robin Carey, head of the School of Business at the University of Central Lancashire: The current UK economy is very fragile. There has been a lack of solid economic and energy policies since the second world war, and the current turbulence within the government and wider socio-economic environment has made matters worse. The approaches to the UK economy that we are seeing tend to be short-term. There needs to be better investment in infrastructure and new energy sources to solve the challenges at hand and to build a sustainable future. The current economic challenges facing Britain will be felt by families across our nation. The volatility of our markets and difficulties across our supply chains will lead to problems in people’s everyday lives. We will see longer waiting times for goods, and a rise in costs for households. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR): It will be a very difficult year for households, particularly those at the lower end of the income distribution. As there is a sharp fall in real disposable income, that will exhaust savings that will also be depleted by rising housing costs. Given the regional distribution of income, this will also act as a regional-specific shock that will increase the pressure to act on “levelling up”.   Victoria Clarke, UK chief economist at Santander Corporate and Investment Banking: We expect the UK to underperform other developed market economies in 2023. In the UK, relatively slow-to-fall inflation will mean that the very significant real income squeeze will continue for longer than in many of the UK’s developed market peers. In addition, the impact of 2022’s interest rate increases, with Bank rate now 325 basis points higher than where it started in 2022, will apply a material squeeze to household budgets, on top of the impact of inflation. For many businesses, the list of pressures faced is similar. Businesses should find some relief from falling goods price inflation in 2023, but strong labour cost inflation may force firms to adjust production, impacting overall economic activity and slowly lifting unemployment. Over time, higher unit labour costs could spur greater capital investment but not in 2023, we believe, with firms focused on their bottom lines. Overall, we expect that the economy entered a recession in the second half of 2022, which we think will continue through the first half of 2023. We forecast a contraction in GDP of 1.5 per cent over 2023. David Cobham, professor of economics at Heriot-Watt University: It will continue to lag behind, and most households will feel hard up, as austerity and Brexit come home to roost and the government has no coherent strategy for dealing with (never mind reversing) their effects. Anonymous: Because of the long shadow of Brexit, and the uncertain consequences of the energy crisis/war, the UK cannot be expected to outpace other developed economies in the next few years. Of course, that will depend crucially on what happens in the eurozone. Diane Coyle, Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge: The UK will lag behind most others; we face a large terms of trade shock on top of a cyclical downturn and our longstanding relatively poor productivity performance. The reality for most households will be (yet another) year of no increase in real living standards. It will feel bleak for many. Bronwyn Curtis, non-executive director at the Office for Budget Responsibility: The UK economy is likely to lag other developed economies. Weak business investment has dogged the economy and I expect that to continue over the coming years. Consumers are facing higher goods and services costs, higher energy costs and falling real wages — and that’s before they face higher mortgage costs as fixed-rate mortgages at very low interest rates roll off. House prices are set to fall again, further dampening consumer confidence. Discontented is the word I would use for households even if employment rates remain relatively high. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics: It will lag. The only reason why the GDP growth figures made it look like it outperformed in 2022 was because it underperformed so much in 2020! I think the UK will endure a recession involving a peak-to-trough fall in real GDP of 2 per cent. GDP in the eurozone may decline by 1 per cent. In the US, it may fall by just 0.5 per cent. Richard Davies, director of Economics Observatory: I’m hoping that global macro forecasters eg the OECD are too pessimistic and that the UK will keep track of other developed nations. My rose-tinted case is that the labour market remains resilient, household balance sheets are strong and higher mortgage payments don’t damp down consumer expenditure as much as many are predicting. Households are still going to feel the pressure — via lower real wages, that is — once inflation recedes, due to the step change in some prices. I think this may cause some debate/concern in 2023, with people complaining that even though inflation is lower, prices are still higher. Howard Davies, chair of NatWest: We will lag, quite a lot. And the big question this year will be how to share the pain of declining real incomes. The public sector is bearing a heavy burden so far, but that may prove politically intolerable. Panicos Demetriades, emeritus professor of financial economics at the University of Leicester: With the UK being the only G7 economy that, as at November 22, remains smaller than its pre-pandemic level, it is hard to see how the UK economy could outpace other developed economies in 2023. Since the decision to exit the EU, itself a historical economic policy blunder, I have little, if any confidence, in the UK’s macroeconomic management. At best, it is in the hands of politicians who put special interests or party politics above the country’s long-term interests. At worst, it is in the hands of incompetent politicians, with a good example being the seven-week-long experiment in “Trussonomics”. Although prime minister Rishi Sunak’s government appears to be more competent than its two predecessors, by now the economy is in much deeper trouble than it needed to be had it been competently managed. Sunak’s also remains a pro-Brexit government, which, by itself, inspires little confidence in their economic or indeed political judgment.  As a result of the above, the Bank of England faces a bigger poisoned chalice than, say, the European Central Bank or the Federal Reserve, in that it may have to raise interest rates more than other leading central banks, in order to safeguard the credibility of monetary policy in the face of question marks over fiscal policy. In November 2022, the UK’s GDP was 0.4 per cent lower than its pre-pandemic level. In sharp contrast, the US GDP was 4.3 per cent higher and the eurozone’s 2.2 per cent higher than their respective pre-pandemic levels. The UK appears to be the “sick man” of the G7 and I cannot see that changing while the economic policy remains in the hands of Brexiters. As far as households are concerned, it is very clear that we are heading for possibly the worst-ever cost of living crisis, with living standards set for the largest fall on record, due to rapid inflation in energy and food, which will be made worse by the rise in borrowing costs. Colin Ellis, global credit strategist at Moody’s Investors Service: UK growth will lag the US and most of Europe. It is already feeling very painful for many households, and that will only get worse in the short term as the government’s energy price cap ends in March. Martin Ellison, professor of economics at the University of Oxford: There’s plenty of storm clouds over the UK and precious little reason for optimism. With a talentless government and no softening of policy towards the EU yet on the horizon, the outlook is dire. The UK will do well to avoid the wooden spoon in the G7 growth league. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association: It will be a challenging 2023 for all major developed economies with GDP remaining flat or marginal growth at best in the coming year due to the impacts of inflation and interest rate rises. However, UK GDP is likely to contract by 1.0 per cent in 2023, representing a shallow recession but it will feel worse for households suffering a second year of real wage falls, particularly for poorer households for whom rising energy and food prices represent a greater proportion of income. Marina Della Giusta, professor of economics at the University of Turin and the University of Reading: Lag behind, with poorer households particularly at a disadvantage. Anonymous: Lag behind. Households will come under strain. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at Oxford Economics: We expect the UK to be one of the worst performing developed economies in 2023, with only Canada and Germany seeing larger contractions in GDP among the G7. High inflation will mean another large fall in real household disposable income, while policy settings will be tight. The full impact of 2022’s tightening of monetary policy is still to be seen, and we expect another 50bp of rate hikes in early-2023. And though the Autumn Statement added little new tightening in 2023, the combination of the withdrawal of pandemic and energy-related support and tax rises announced by previous chancellors means the fiscal stance will be much tighter next year. Households will find life very tough. Another steep fall in real income will come on the back of what has already been the largest squeeze on spending power since the second world war. Unemployment is likely to rise, albeit quite modestly. And homeowners coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals are likely to be offered new deals with interest rates that are at least 300bp higher than their old ones. Paul De Grauwe, John Paulson chair in European political economy at LSE: The UK economy is likely to lag behind other developed economies in 2023 because of the increasing negative resonance of Brexit. Households will pay the brunt of the long-term costs of Brexit. Oliver de Groot, chair in macroeconomics at University of Liverpool Management School: The UK economy is likely to be in recession for much of 2023. The squeeze on household finances in 2022 is likely to persist in 2023, leading to a prolonged decline in consumer spending. Anonymous: The UK economy will lag other DM economies in 2023, with households feeling increased job security but greater pressure on their finances. Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist at Société Générale: Lag and it will feel terrible for households. Jessica Hinds, economist at Fitch Ratings: The UK will lag the US and Europe and will suffer a deeper recession. It looks set to be a very tough year for households, who face rising energy and food bills as well as higher mortgage rates and an increase in unemployment. Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas: The UK looks set to remain the laggard in 2023 as a combination of cyclical headwinds and structural issues take their toll. As for households, we expect 2023 to be another relatively bleak year. Households have already been dealt a significant blow to their purchasing power from rampant inflation. Next year we will see more clearly the effects of monetary policy tightening play out, especially in the housing market. To be clear, we think this will be a synchronised global slowdown (the UK isn’t alone) — but we expect the UK to nonetheless lag behind. Ethan Ilzetzki, associate professor of economics at LSE: The UK will lag behind other developed economies in 2023. Covid has left greater scars on the UK workforce than most other countries and Brexit uncertainty will continue to be a drag on the economy unless the government finally acknowledges this problem and negotiates better relationships with our EU trading partners. Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at BCA Research: Lag. The UK (and the US) is suffering a structural shortage of workers caused by “excess early retirements” during the pandemic. The only way to rebalance the labour market — and kill wage inflation — is to kill labour demand, meaning take the economy into recession. The euro area and Japan do not have the same structural problem with their labour markets as do the UK (and the US), so their downturns will be milder than in the UK and the US. For UK households, 2023 will be a year when the main concern shifts from inflation to recession. DeAnne Julius, distinguished fellow at Chatham House: I expect the UK will be about the same (shallow recession) as other European economies in 2023. Stephen King, senior economic adviser at HSBC: Lag behind, not helped by the painful need to restore fiscal credibility in the light of the Truss/Kwarteng fiasco. Lena Komileva, chief economist at G+ Economics: With the weakest productivity per capita, combined with the highest structural inflation problem among major economies, the UK economy is clearly a laggard. The issue is not labour, it is structural rigidity, eg government policy, ranging from Brexit to social inequality. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC UK: Despite a relatively buoyant labour market, UK households will remain cautious. There are quite a few reasons to be less cheery about households including the continued real wage contraction, house price decreases (with associated negative wealth effects), the household savings ratio remaining relatively constant (in view of decreasing house prices) and the generally uncertain mood on the outlook. Households make up the largest proportion of the UK economic activity by far, so if households don’t spend the economy suffers. Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the CBI: The UK economy is likely to lag other developed economies in 2023. In particular, the tightness in the labour market — reflecting both changes in the composition of migration, those taking early retirement and potential shortcomings in healthcare provision — doesn’t look likely to improve markedly in the near term. This will continue to apply a break to growth for companies, drive industrial unrest and push up domestically generated inflationary pressures. For households, it’ll come down to wage settlements vs inflation. Inflation “should” come down swiftly next year even after government support expires, provided there aren’t further global shocks in energy markets — a pretty big proviso. The sharpness of the decline in real incomes based on current projections will constrain household confidence and discretionary spending significantly. It will be a tough year. Warwick Lightfoot, independent economist: UK economic activity will be relatively weak as a result of discretionary tightening in fiscal policy, raising taxes, weaker terms of trade, and a weaker supply performance arising from a higher ratio of general government expenditure to output, a less neutral and more complex tax regime that will aggravate the deadweight cost of financing a larger public sector. John Llewellyn, partner at Independent Economics (formerly Llewellyn Consulting): Lag. Households will feel a continuing gap between inflation and the evolution of their incomes. And when they visit the EU on holiday, they will be surprised at how unable they are to afford things that they used to be able to. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth: I don’t expect the UK to either outperform or lag other major western countries over the next year. That is because the challenges confronting the UK are similar to those faced elsewhere. In terms of the main macroeconomic variables such as growth, jobs and inflation the UK’s relative performance is likely be in the middle of the pack when compared with the other major western European economies. It will be a tough year for household incomes, for similar reasons to those we have already seen during 2022. In fact, 2023 may prove to be the year of the good, the bad and the uncertain for the UK. The good is that inflation has peaked and looks set to decelerate significantly, the bad that growth will be weak with recession likely and the uncertain being how fragile or resilient the jobs, financial and property markets prove to be. Stephen Machin, professor of economics and director of the Centre for Economic Performance at LSE: It seems likely to lag behind, as it faces additional pressures (supply chain disruptions, Brexit) compared to other developed economies. Lagging behind would put households in an even more adverse position and, since these effects vary across the income distribution, affect inequality. Chris Martin, professor of economics at University of Bath: I fear the UK economy will continue to stagnate until serious measures to promote productivity growth, around education, training and investment, are put in place. Households will increasingly realise the UK is declining in comparison to other countries; household real incomes will probably not notice any real income growth for the next couple of years. David Meenagh, reader in economics at Cardiff University: The UK will grow less than most developed countries in 2023 and this will have a detrimental effect on households. Costas Milas, professor of finance at the University of Liverpool: It will lag behind other developed economies. A combination of higher inflation (due to the war in Ukraine but also due to Brexit) together with lower real wages will affect households negatively. There is, however, a way of boosting the economy. Since the EU remains UK’s main trade partner, it makes sense for us to reduce trade frictions with Brussels. To do so, Sunak needs to sidestep his Brexiteer MPs. How to do this? Sunak could commission a detailed survey asking UK businesses to choose/name their preferred trade relationship with their counterparts in Europe. At the end of the day, UK businesses have a much better idea than Brexiteer (or even non-Brexiteer!) MPs on how to fire up the economy. Stephen Millard, deputy director for macroeconomic modelling and forecasting at NIESR: The UK is likely to grow — but by very little — over 2023 and this will be roughly in line with other developed economies. Unfortunately, with real incomes continuing to fall, it will feel like a very tough year for households. Andrew Mountford, professor at Royal Holloway, University of London: I expect that the UK will continue to lag behind most other developed economies for the same reasons that it has underperformed them this year. The UK is facing the same global headwinds as other countries but is additionally hampered by: 1) reduced investment from Brexit; 2) a sicker, less productive workforce due to a public sector that is suffering from significant and prolonged under-investment and the consequence of the UK’s relatively poor management of the pandemic; 3) a greater level of industrial unrest in the UK than elsewhere due to the UK’s high income inequality and relatively low standard of living for median UK households coupled with the inability of policymakers to mitigate the effect of energy price rises effectively. John Muellbauer, professor of economics at the University of Oxford: The UK will lag behind major other G7 economies for multiple reasons including Brexit and its interaction with the pandemic, and 12 years of under-investment, especially in health and infrastructure. Gulnur Muradoglu, professor of finance at Queen Mary University of London: It will be very hard for households. Note that household expenditure inflation is much higher than the average 11 per cent. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick: I expect it to lag behind. How things will feel for a household depends on wealth and location. I tried to get a dinner reservation in a number of expensive London restaurants recently and struggled to find a table. Our country is characterised by a striking level of inequality. But the median household will feel the pain of a drop in real income of about 5 per cent. We know from behavioural science evidence that humans exhibit extreme loss aversion. David Page, head of macro research at Axa Investment Managers: We expect the UK economy to lag behind the pace of other economies in 2023. While the UK is not likely to be as directly impacted by the energy crisis as some countries across the eurozone, we think the impact on real incomes — already the sharpest since the second world war on many metrics — will see persistent contraction over the summer. Fundamentally, as well as the impact of more expensive gas, which feeds through more directly to UK retail prices than in other economies, the UK has not offset the material impact of Brexit and this is weighing on the economy’s ability to grow at its previous pace without generating inflation. With household incomes already squeezed and the only way for the Bank of England to restore longer-term price stability to soften a tight labour market, 2023 might be a tough year for households to live through although should be showing signs of improvement towards the year-end, particularly compared to the end of this year. Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI: We expect UK growth to be near the bottom of the pack over 2023. Higher inflation will linger for longer, leading to a drawn-out hit to households’ real incomes. While the squeeze should alleviate as the year progresses, it’s still likely to be another tough year for many households. Those towards the lower end of the income distribution will feel the pain most, not benefiting from the cushion of higher savings seen by their wealthier counterparts. Weaker household spending will also mean a tough trading environment for many businesses, particularly consumer-facing ones. John Philpott, director of The Jobs economist: Lag behind because of a relatively hard squeeze on household incomes from a combination of falling real wages, higher interest rates and tax-raising measures. The 2023 recession will feel much worse than the economic impact of the pandemic. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank: The ongoing recession that started in Q3 2022 appears to be slightly deeper in the UK than in other major European economies. In addition to the global energy shock which hits all major European economies, financial conditions have tightened more in the UK than elsewhere. This is due to the BoE’s earlier and more aggressive tightening to curb inflation, compared to the European Central Bank, as well as the lasting shock to money and credit markets following the “mini” Budget on September 23. The current situation for households is tough. The combination of falling real wages, tight financial conditions and housing market correction are as bad as it gets. However, the pain is likely to ease through next year as inflation rolls over and financing conditions ease a little. From early summer onwards, once the recession gives way to recovery, UK economic momentum should roughly keep pace with the broader European recovery. Christopher Pissarides, regius professor of economics at LSE and 2010 Nobel laureate: It will lag behind the US and very likely the EU. The main reason is the problems in the labour market, which are more serious here. Households will feel a fall in their living standards, which, however small, will make them feel worse. Ian Plenderleith, former MPC member: Lag behind, because of continuing labour shortage and low productivity. Households will continue to feel under stress (inflation, high energy costs), but no worse than at present because of continuing high employment. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London: The UK’s relative underperformance is likely to persist. Brexit will continue to be a “slow puncture” for the UK economy, and to the extent that the fall in labour force participation has been driven by the NHS crisis, this is also likely to continue to be a drag on growth. The squeeze on household incomes will continue, although cushioned by the energy price guarantee, relatively high nominal wage growth in the private sector, and inflation-linked increase in benefits and pensions. Richard Portes, professor of economics at London Business School: Lag. We are entering demand-driven recession. Households will continue to feel severe real income squeeze. Though the inflation rate will come down significantly, the price level rise will of course not be reversed, and wages will not catch up with it. Of course, taxes will also rise. Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) and former joint head of the Government Economic Service: The UK looks set to do worse than many other developed economies. The war in Ukraine brought the post-Covid global recovery to an abrupt end but the UK is one of the few countries to now have both a tighter monetary stance and a significantly tighter fiscal stance that therefore allows little room for growth. Add to that the impact of Brexit and it is not difficult to see why the UK will struggle more than most. Cost of living issues are affecting countries across the board but here wages, particularly in the public sector, are falling seriously behind while, by comparison to other countries, the support with energy and other costs for businesses and the consumer has been both patchy and limited. What is more, the extent of continued support, such as it is, remains uncertain into 2023. Some consumers do have savings they have accumulated during the Covid years but those will soon begin to run thin and in any case, people at the lower end of the pay scale have no savings to speak of and food and energy price increases are hitting them disproportionately. Real household disposable incomes are being severely squeezed. Inequality, which had been falling, is on the increase again. And with house prices also predicted to fall sharply as mortgage rate hikes take their toll, even the positive wealth effect we have seen that generally encouraged consumption during Covid and beyond will turn negative. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at RSM UK: The UK is the only G7 country where quarterly GDP has not exceeded its pre-pandemic level and it will remain at the bottom of the pack for the next year. Admittedly, some of this relates to measurement issues. But most of it is due to lower household spending, which itself is a result of employment in the UK growing more slowly than in other places and higher inflation as well as lower consumer confidence. All these factors are likely to continue into 2023. What’s more, fiscal policy is likely to be considerably tighter in the UK than in comparable countries over the next year. As a result, GDP is likely to drop by around 1.5 per cent in 2023, compared to annual growth of 0.5 per cent in the US and 0 per cent in the eurozone.  Households’ disposable incomes will continue to be hammered by inflation, which although now falling, will still average around 7.5 per cent in 2023. As if that wasn’t enough, the surge in mortgage rates will further weaken households’ disposable incomes. Mortgage rates have advanced well ahead of the base rate, as banks anticipate higher interest rates — meaning that anyone unlucky enough to be mortgaging over the next few months will see a potentially larger than expected share of their income spent on the soaring mortgage interest. What’s more, a loosening labour market — as firms reduce hiring and even start to cut workforce numbers — will result in nominal wage growth dropping back to more “normal” levels. Throw in higher taxes and a real-terms reduction in public sector pay, and the 2023 outlook is bleak for households’ real disposable income. All in, we are expecting RHDI to contract by 2.5 per cent in 2023. This would be the biggest fall on record. Sonali Punhani, head of UK economics at Credit Suisse: We expect the UK economy to lag behind other developed economies in 2023 and be in a year-long recession with a peak-to-trough GDP decline of 2 per cent. The contraction in activity would be driven by the real income squeeze on consumers and businesses, monetary tightening by the BoE and weaker external demand. Household incomes are likely to be squeezed by a combination of still high inflation and high interest rates, thereby falling by record amounts of around 3 per cent in 2023. This should constrain the ability of households to spend, though high levels of savings, tight labour markets and fiscal policy should reduce the severity of the shock. In our view, the impact of monetary tightening on household cash flows will accelerate in 2023 as fixed-rate mortgages roll off, with household mortgage debt service 2.2 percentage points of disposable income higher in late 2023 compared to now. Morten O. Ravn, professor of economics at University College London: The UK has taken a larger hit from Covid-19 and from the cost of living crisis than most other developed economies. It should therefore in principle outpace other countries in the recovery phase which hopefully will start in 2023. However, this will be hampered by the need for a contractionary monetary policy stance, fiscal austerity, as well as the continuing negative consequences of Brexit. Therefore, the outlook is mixed and there is a significant risk that the UK will lag behind other developed economies. John Van Reenen, Ronald Coase chair in economics at LSE: The UK will lag behind other developed countries. Things will feel tough for households, not because of this (people don’t do international comparisons), but because it will be worse than the last few years, which have also been pretty awful. Ricardo Reis, AW Phillips professor of economics at LSE: Lag, since the UK suffers from an energy shock as bad as Europe’s, an inflation problem requiring tighter monetary policy as bad as the US, and a unique problem of lack of labour supply from the combination of Brexit and the NHS crisis. Anonymous: Lag behind and feel uncomfortable. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury: I expect the UK economy to lag slightly behind its major peers, but hold up better than currently expected in 2023. The UK labour market is strong, and consumers are resilient, while a smaller squeeze on real incomes should ease the pain for households. A technical recession appears inevitable, though I don’t believe it will be as bad as the BoE is indicating. Jumana Saleheen, chief economist and head of investment strategy group, Europe at Vanguard: 2023 will be a year of disinflation at a cost: inflation will come down in 2023 but it will come at the cost of a recession. We expect the recession in the UK to be worse — longer and deeper — than other developed economies such as the US and euro area. The UK is forecast to be the laggard for three reasons: (a) momentum in the economy has been weaker than other developed economies. UK output is still below its pre-pandemic level; (b) as a net importer of natural gas, with few storage facilities, the UK has suffered more from the energy crisis than the eurozone. The US is different because it is a net exporter of oil and natural gas; and (c) the structure of the housing and mortgage market in the UK is such that the pass-through from higher interest rates to household income is faster than elsewhere. We estimate that 35-40 per cent of UK mortgages will have to be re-priced at higher rates by the end of 2023, lowering their disposable income by 10 per cent on average. It will be a challenging year for households as they erode their savings and experience unprecedented falls in their real income. Michael Saunders, senior adviser at Oxford Economics: The UK economy is likely to be weaker than most developed economies in 2023. The coming year will feel miserable for UK households, with falling real incomes, falling house prices and rising unemployment. Apart from cyclical factors, the underlying problem for the UK economy is persistently weak potential output growth, which has been further reduced by Brexit — and especially the government’s choice of a relatively hard Brexit — and the pandemic. The UK government currently lacks a serious plan to address this underlying issue of persistently low potential growth. Such a plan should probably focus on closer trade links with the EU, following OECD advice to prioritise training, education and public investment, and measures to reverse the rise in long-term sickness to lift workforce participation.   Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG: The UK economy is in an unfortunate position. It is relatively exposed to higher gas prices, as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, while has also seen base interest rates rise steeply, which could result in a sharper decline in GDP in 2023 here compared to other developed economies. UK households are generally more exposed to the sharp rise in mortgage rates, with just under 50 per cent of mortgage holders expected to experience higher mortgage costs by the end of 2023 despite the fact that most mortgages are now fixed. Households will also see their purchasing power decline further in 2023, as wage increases will not reach high enough to meet inflation for most workers. Andrew Sentance, senior adviser at Cambridge Econometrics: I expect the UK economy to contract by 1-1.5 per cent on a calendar-year basis in 2023. All major western economies face some sort of recession driven by the squeeze on consumer spending from high inflation and the associated uncertainty affecting business investment. I would expect the UK to be similarly affected as other European economies. The US may get off more lightly because of its historic economic dynamism and the fact that inflation has not risen as high in Europe. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec: The UK looks set to lag behind. Inflation is hitting British households harder than in other countries, not least due to the UK’s greater exposure to natural gas prices and despite a considerable degree of government intervention to keep bills down. It is difficult to envisage anything but consumers struggling after a second successive year of real household net incomes declining by around 3.5 per cent. Andrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute and research associate at the Centre for Global Political Economy, Sussex University: The UK has voluntarily placed itself at a disadvantage in relation to other developed economies in two key ways: firstly by not revisiting the self-harm of Brexit, even though public opinion has now swung decisively to see leaving the EU as a mistake, and secondly by leaving firms and households exposed to high energy costs through a succession of policy failures. In considering whether or not the UK economy will ‘outpace or lag behind’ others the vital caveat is to ask ‘with regard to what?’ The international scientific community has determined this to be the last decade available for meaningful action to preserve a habitable climate, so the only meaningful measure of success is the UK’s relative performance at meeting economic needs, and ensuring the quality of life whilst hitting climate targets. No developed economy is doing enough — current plans see the world overshooting both the 1.5C and 2C climate targets. But for comparison, the US has the tellingly titled Inflation Reduction Act that includes a massive $369bn package of investments into climate-related measures, while the EU has the Green Deal investment plan with €503bn allocated to climate and environment from the EU 2021-2027 budget, 25 per cent of the total budget, and including €100bn over the same period for a Just Transition Mechanism to ease the process of change. South Korea, meanwhile, has a Korean New Deal, or “K-New Deal” backed by a US$135bn investment programme that includes measures to create 659,000 new green jobs by 2025.  At the same time, the UK is missing key opportunities to ease economic pressures and spur positive, ecologically viable activity. Policy has been actively spurned to shift demand away from high-energy, polluting goods, increase energy efficiency and realise the potential of cost, carbon and pollution-saving behaviour change. Lifting the fracking ban and clinging on to North Sea oil and gas contradicts climate goals and slows the transition to cleaner, cheaper and more employment-intensive renewable alternatives. Gifting energy companies excess profits via household energy subsidies, instead of investing in massive housing retrofit and the heat pump revolution, is another missed opportunity. To properly answer this question would need an international index measuring transition to zero carbon, high wellbeing economies. Nina Skero, chief executive of Cebr: Cebr is expecting the UK’s economic performance to roughly match or slightly lag behind those of major European countries, while lagging the growth rates seen in the US more significantly. In terms of how 2023 will be experienced by households, the anticipated inflationary and wage trends are exacerbating the quality of life differences between the poor and the more affluent. Those that are relatively well off are seeing higher wage rises and, in some cases, still have Covid savings to dip into. On the other hand, poorer households are seeing staggering real wage declines and struggling to cover the costs of essential items. Rising mortgage rates (and a potential shortage of rental units) will add significantly to the cost of living for households across the income spectrum. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation: The UK is suffering from a perfect storm of European energy price inflation and a US-style tight labour market. The former will leave us permanently poorer; the latter means high inflation will last for longer. All this, combined with the ongoing Brexit disruption and exposure to spillovers from aggressive global monetary tightening, means the UK looks likely to underperform other major advanced economies. The good news is that global inflationary pressure could whipsaw this year, with the possibility that global inflation headwinds could become tailwinds. But even if the worst of the imported inflation may be behind us, things will get worse for households in 2023. While wholesale energy prices have been falling, families must get ready for the largest rise in retail prices on record. And the lasting high inflation is set to mean wages will be falling for the bulk of this year. This will hurt all families. But the pain could become more concentrated if unemployment starts to rise. The other big shift for families will be rising mortgage costs, with around 3mn mortgages subject to rising interest rates. James Smith, economist at ING: We expect the UK economy to contract by a little over 1.5 per cent next year, and that doesn’t look particularly different to Europe. Ultimately, a lot will depend on the relative support offered by different governments for household/business energy prices. The UK’s decision to make energy support less generous, combined with higher mortgage rates, looks set to deliver weaker consumer spending through the first half of the year. The manufacturing and construction sectors are both likely to take a hit too. Andrew Smithers, author: The trend growth rate of the UK is probably the slowest of major developed economies and this is likely to result in the country’s growth lagging. Alfie Stirling, chief economist at the New Economics Foundation: The UK economy will lag other developed countries, largely on account of having the wrong policy mix. The combination of tight monetary policy and fiscal policy at the same time risks deepening the recession and delaying the recovery. This will mean a higher degree of financial hardship for families in the UK compared with similar economies, including lower pay, weaker income support, more unemployment and higher mortgage costs than might otherwise be the case. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The UK economy will lag behind other G20 nations, with spending dropping behind the curve as consumers prepare for a year-long recession and the UK continues to experience a severe Brexit hangover. Although Germany is also set to have a tough year ahead, only Russia is set to contract more sharply than the UK. The UK economy is heavily reliant on consumer spending, and although confidence has staged a fragile recovery, households are fearful of what lies ahead and are set to continue to tighten the purse strings as inflationary pressures continue. Tax rises aimed at restoring financial stability, and a rise in energy bills next spring, will eat further into consumer sentiment. We are likely to see more job uncertainty and insecurity for households, with unemployment forecast to rise over the year. Michael Taylor, economist at Redburn: The UK has already entered recession in 2022 while the eurozone and US will both fall into recession in 2023. Overall, the UK economy is likely to contract in the year as a whole by around 1 per cent, underperforming most of its peers, most of whom will stagnate or even also contract slightly.   Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW: The outlook is exceptionally bleak, with the UK facing a toxic mix of recession and soaring inflation. High inflation and tighter monetary and fiscal policy are likely to continue to squeeze incomes, keeping the UK economy underwater throughout this year. Indeed, it’s probable that quarterly GDP growth will be negative throughout 2023. It will feel pretty awful for many households because living standards are likely to nosedive as inflation outstrips wages, tax thresholds are frozen and the effects of aggressively raising interest rates are fully felt. We also may see a renewed wage squeeze as the myriad of cost pressures facing businesses and rising unemployment weigh on pay settlements, particularly damaging poorer households. The UK will probably lag other developed economies because structural challenges such as Brexit are making it harder to deal with these headwinds compared to its peers by exacerbating trade frictions and staff shortages. Phil Thornton, director at Clarity Economics: The British economy will likely lag most of its developed peers in 2023 and will fall into recession. One reason is a continued fall in real household income. Real wage growth in 2022 fell at the fastest rate for some 50 years and, thanks to high inflation and Brexit, will continue to cause severe pain for households next year. Anna Titareva, European economist at UBS: We forecast UK GDP to contract 0.5 per cent in 2023 compared to a moderate expansion of 0.2 per cent in the eurozone. Hence, we expect the UK to underperform the eurozone. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: The UK economy will experience the deepest recession among advanced economies in 2023, due to the unparalleled intensity of fiscal and monetary tightening and the underlying weakness of trend growth. We look for a 2 per cent peak-to-trough fall in GDP, which would result in a 1.5 per cent year-over-year decline in 2023, and expect a recovery to commence only in Q1 2024. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors: Neither. The UK economy will perform in the middle of the European pack in 2023, as it is broadly subject to the same pressures. However, it will lag the US where the inflationary peak has come a little sooner, leading to higher consumer confidence and so greater household spending on the other side of the Atlantic. Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders: Like much of the developed world the UK will be in recession in 2023. There is little reason to expect UK outperformance given the scale of its inflation problem and poor prospects for trade growth post-Brexit. Households will have to contend with higher unemployment whilst concerns over the cost of living will continue. Sushil Wadhwani, chief investment officer at PGIM Wadhwani: The UK is likely to underperform most G7 economies. We appear to have an unenviable cocktail of factors: a) the adverse effects of Brexit on labour supply, prices and trade; b) the rise in inactivity amongst the over-50s, perhaps worsened by NHS waiting lists and the lack of adequate spending on either long Covid or mental health (this area requires further research, and some of the rises are puzzling); c) an energy price shock that is worse than in some other places (eg the US); d) interest rates that are likely to rise by more than the BoE appears to think; and e) investment spending deterred by uncertainty, which is likely to be worsened by inflation likely to remain higher than the consensus expects. Ross Walker, chief UK economist at NatWest Markets: Lag. Expensive-headline inflation will fall in 2023 but will remain significantly above target (CPI to end 2023 at about 5 per cent). Martin Weale, professor of economics at King’s College London: I expect it to lag behind. Households will feel a very sharp squeeze. Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC: The UK is likely to underperform the eurozone through 2023. The UK economy probably entered recession earlier and is likely to contract for slightly longer. Partly this reflects higher inflation and slightly tighter monetary policy, as well as the expected scaling back of energy support. Households that rent or need to refix their mortgage in 2023 will clearly suffer a greater reduction in real disposable income, as will low-income households, for whom a higher proportion of spending is on food and energy.   Matt Whittaker, chief executive of Pro Bono Economics: The cumulative effect of the global financial crisis, Brexit, the pandemic and now the cost of living pressures mean that, even by recent remarkable standards, 2023 looks like being an especially difficult year for living standards. While coming down from its 40-year high, inflation is set to remain elevated. The labour market, which has outperformed expectations for much of the last decade, is showing clear signs of softening. And rising interest rates will increasingly feed into a growing debt repayment burden for many households used to the era of cheap credit. The squeeze on households will be made worse still by the increasing pressure coming to bear on already strained public services.  And the charity sector — so often the one which picks up the slack during difficult times — is facing a perfect storm of its own, with demand for help rising just as capacity is constrained by falling donations. Half of all charities expect demand at the start of the year to outstrip their ability to cope. While the current crisis is a broad-based one, it will inevitably be those with the most limited resources who are again most exposed to what comes next. Lower-income households have the least scope for cutting back further on expenditure, while they are also among those most likely to have used credit as a means of getting by. Recent government policy shifts have provided some support for this group, but the outlook remains nonetheless difficult, and further targeted support may be needed over the course of the year.   Michael Wickens, professor of economics at York and Cardiff universities: Keep pace with other developed countries.  Trevor Williams, visiting professor at the University of Derby: Lag — and UK households will be one of the hardest hits. The UK has low productivity and, therefore, low pay. Real pay — nominal pay adjusted for consumer price inflation — will decline and energy and food prices are some of the highest in Europe. Evan Wohlmann, senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service: We expect the UK economy to contract by 0.3 per cent in 2023, a worse performance than most other G20 advanced economies, as higher prices and tighter monetary policy will hurt consumer spending, investment and wider economic sentiment. Despite significant fiscal support, households will continue to see an erosion of their purchasing power as inflation, aided by higher administration costs post-Brexit, remains above target for a prolonged period. The UK’s shorter-dated mortgage market compared to the likes of Germany and the Netherlands will expose a significant share of UK households to rising mortgage rates. That said, while oil and gas make up around 80 per cent of the UK’s energy mix, the risk of energy rationing is marginally lower compared to Germany and Italy whose economies; under the weight of this uncertainty, we expect will contract in real terms by more than the UK over the coming year. Linda Yueh, fellow in economics at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford and adjunct professor of economics at London Business School: The UK is a more open economy, so it is more affected by global energy prices that have affected household disposable income. This cost of living crisis could mean that the UK lags behind other developed economies. But fiscal policy can cushion this impact, so the UK need not fare worse than other economies. For households, inflation plus some rising unemployment will make the year feel recessionary. Azad Zangana, senior European economist & strategist at Schroders: The UK economy will probably be in recession through the winter of 2022-23 and start to see growth again by the second half of 2023. The eurozone should see a slightly faster recovery, but the US will likely be in recession at that point. Overall, though, it will be a difficult year for households as inflation is likely to remain elevated throughout the year. Monetary policy: How tough will the Bank of England need to be in 2023 to curb inflation?   Silvia Ardagna: We are expecting the BoE to increase Bank rate to 4.25 per cent. Kate Barker: Depends on whether we see any relief from energy prices. If no relief, then the BoE will need to be clear that Bank rate is not going to be reduced for some time — but may not need to push the peak up from where it has signalled. Crucially the recent upward shift in inflation expectations needs to be reversed.  Nicholas Barr: The pandemic has led to a significant shake-out of the labour market, with good arguments that in some sectors it has led to increased labour productivity. To the extent that that is so, higher productivity should call forth higher pay. If, instead, economic policy treats wage increases as inflationary and hence tightens monetary policy, the effect will be contractionary. More generally, macroeconomic policy that takes insufficient account of changes in the labour market risks making things worse. Ray Barrell: Inflation generally reacts slowly to interest rate rises, and more may need to be done. We should expect rates to be at least 1 percentage point higher in six months. More may be needed, but that depends on the war in Ukraine. Charlie Bean: Rates will probably need to rise further but, perhaps more significantly, they will probably need to stay elevated for some while, reflecting the internally generated persistence in inflation. Martin Beck: We think the BoE will pause rate rises in early 2023, with Bank rate peaking at no more than 4 per cent. By that point, it should be becoming apparent that the threat of high and rising inflation is receding. The surge in energy and commodity prices in early 2021 will drop out of the annual inflation comparison and falls in the price of raw materials and shipping costs in recent months and the effect of weaker global demand will feed through into consumer prices.  David Bell: The BoE’s resolve seemed to weaken somewhat at the December meeting, with two members voting to hold at 3 per cent. Peak rates are likely in the range of 4-4.25 per cent. Absent further supply shocks, this will be sufficient, perhaps more than sufficient, to curb inflation. Aveek Bhattacharya: With the economy facing recession, and some promising signs that inflation has peaked, there are grounds for optimism that the BoE will not need to raise interest rates much further, if at all, in the year ahead. Danny Blanchflower: It will have to cut rates as inflation falls fast and bankruptcies rise along with labour market slack. Disastrous groupthink at the BoE is a major issue. Lack of diversity must be addressed — members all live in London and seem to not understand the rest of the country. Philip Booth: The BoE has probably done about enough to reverse the rise in inflation and bring it down over a two-year period. Interest rates may have to continue to rise a little and they will not return to previously low levels when inflation falls. Andrew Brigden: The extent to which interest rates will need to rise will depend largely on the magnitude of so-called second-round effects, as the first-round effects (reflecting upward pressure on global prices as the major economies began to reopen, and more recently the shock to energy prices) begin to fade. We already see evidence of second-round effects in the UK data: wage inflation is responding to consumer price inflation in a way that is inconsistent with meeting the 2 per cent target, and core inflation is responding to rises in non-core components of inflation in a way that it has not done for some time. Our central scenario sees second-round effects begin to dissipate through next year, as the economy slows further, and monetary policy continues to tighten effect. In that scenario, we see Bank rate peaking at just over 5 per cent in the second half of next year. But we give 30 per cent weight to a risk scenario that sees second-round effects intensify, and the wage-price spiral that is already in train, escalate. This could see Bank rate go much higher before inflation is brought back under control. George Buckley: We see the Bank raising rates by a further 75 basis points in Q1 2023 to a peak of 4.25 per cent, which we think — being held there for a year — will be sufficient to ultimately bring inflation back to target, though not until the very end of 2024. We see rates being cut by 75bp to 3.5 per cent during the summer of 2024 in response to slowing inflation. Robin Carey: The BoE must provide a balanced approach to support the people of our country. Keeping up with interest rate rises, paying mortgages and paying off loans are all concerns facing the population. The Bank’s response to such financial discomfort needs to be family focused, with an understanding of the difficulties people across the country are facing. Jagjit Chadha: Base effects will lead to a rapid fall in inflation from the middle of next year. That is very much baked in, save a further escalation in energy prices or a fall in sterling. The BoE will have to be consistent in signalling a wish to bring inflation down to levels consistent with price stability but there is no need to jump in rapid steps to something much higher than 4 per cent. A gradual move with some leeway to move up or down the terminal level ought to bring inflation down in 2024 to something like 2 per cent, without leading to an unnecessarily large fall in demand.  Victoria Clarke: We believe that most members of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee will start 2023 still with a tightening bias, faced with a backdrop of very elevated inflation and with a sense of concern that the tight jobs market could fuel further, persistent, domestically-generated inflation. But the degree of tightening enacted so far will lead the BoE to become more nervous about pressing on too much further with rate increases. We do not expect the BoE to proclaim the end of the tightening cycle, but rather to pause with Bank rate at around 4 per cent after Q1. We expect this pause to be slowly extended through 2023. We do not anticipate cuts in Bank rate this year, with the BoE likely to judge that holding this restrictive policy stance is necessary to slowly reduce more stubborn services inflation, amidst the likelihood that the tight UK workforce generates strong pay growth, whilst productivity growth remains lacklustre. We expect cuts to Bank rate only in 2024. However, even then the MPC may wish to keep Bank rate on the tight side of neutral. The drop in the UK labour force participation rate has not started to reverse in the UK as it has in many of the UK’s peers. David Cobham: With luck, it will ease off quite soon, as it should do. Anonymous: Although inflation has perhaps already peaked, and the UK inflation has been historically relatively variable, it is possible that there will be some unexpected persistence. With financial vulnerabilities and fiscal imbalances, the BoE will be in a difficult spot, but it will have to show determination. Diane Coyle: It’s harder than many expect to squeeze inflation down from over 10 per cent to 2 per cent, especially given the weak supply side of the economy. Bronwyn Curtis: Having been slow to raise rates, they are now at risk of tightening too much. Energy prices have already fallen and supply logjams are loosening so inflationary pressures have already eased. More importantly, gilt yields have risen significantly across the whole interest rate curve, making it much more expensive for companies to raise capital. That lowers potential output and will dampen inflation further. I see inflation falls more and more quickly than the bank is currently forecasting. Paul Dales: Tougher than most expect. I think the Bank will continue to raise interest rates in the early part of the year, to a peak of 4.5 per cent, even as inflation is falling. It will then need to keep rates at that level all year to ensure that inflation falls all the way to the 2 per cent target in 2024. Richard Davies: The answer here depends on your perspective. I think 2023 will be a case of holding steady for the BoE. Those with a short-run view might interpret this as “tough”. Those with a longer-term view know that in truth the rates we see are still low by historical standards. This means one of the major challenges is communicating what the Bank is doing: the recent hikes seem extraordinary, but in a long-run macro perspective — which is important in times like this — they are not. The optimistic scenario is that the Bank will hold (more or less) steady, inflation begins to fall and we get inflation down and growth returning with more gradual changes to Bank rate in the near future.   Howard Davies: They will need to tighten a little more. How much more will depend on how far wages rise, and unemployment falls. I expect a further 100 bps over the year. Panicos Demetriades: As I explained above, the BoE faces greater challenges than other major central banks, in light of the question marks over the UK’s macroeconomic management, as well as the experiment in “Trussonomics”, which brought the Bank’s own credibility under question. To put it in macroeconomic terms, inflation expectations in the UK, are, in my opinion, less anchored to the 2 per cent target than they are in the eurozone, where the credibility of monetary policymakers remains relatively intact. This, by itself, means that the BoE will require a bigger increase in interest rates than the ECB to bring inflation down. Already, the Bank’s base rate is one full percentage point higher than the ECB’s — I find it hard not to describe this as another “Brexit dividend”. Colin Ellis: I don’t think the BoE will need to be as tough as the Fed has already been here. Prospects are pretty good for inflation falling relatively sharply during 2023, if not all the way back to the 2 per cent target. But I expect headline inflation to decline swiftly this year — and then a bit of a slow grind to get it back down all the way towards 2 per cent. Martin Ellison: High inflation will mechanically fall out of the figures as 2023 progresses, which will ease pressure on the BoE to raise interest rates. Whether the Bank responds by holding its nerve remains to be seen — the risk is now that they don’t relax monetary policy in time. Noble Francis: The BoE does not need to be substantially tougher to constrain CPI inflation given that it is likely to have peaked. Inflation will slow significantly from spring 2023, if only due to base effects, as it is a year on from the spikes in energy, oil and commodity prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Bank’s base rate is likely to peak at 4 per cent early in 2023. Marina Della Giusta: Inflation in the UK will probably not benefit from further restrictive monetary policy. Anonymous: They will not be tough enough. Andrew Goodwin: I think the BoE has already done enough, but I expect it to do more. There’s very little evidence to back their fears of an unsustainable pick-up in wage growth, and weaker activity should cause labour market conditions to loosen by lowering demand. I suspect the BoE will eventually come around to this way of thinking, but not until it has increased Bank rate to at least 4 per cent. Paul De Grauwe: Provided no new negative shocks occur in energy prices and supplies, inflation should abate significantly in 2023 making it possible for the BoE to relax its monetary policy stance.  Oliver de Groot: The possibility that above-target inflation (and inflation expectations) becomes embedded in the UK is a major risk facing the BoE in 2023. Allowing inflation expectations to become unanchored will be more costly for economic activity in the long run than the short-run costs of curbing inflation. As such, the Bank will need to be tough on inflation. Nevertheless, it faces delicate decision-making in setting policy correctly. Anonymous: It will be difficult, especially if the UK economy experiences another supply-side shock from energy markets. Getting rates and holding them above 4 per cent will be difficult for the economy. Brian Hilliard: Not very. Bank rate to peak at 4.5 per cent with risk of less. Jessica Hinds: Headline inflation is highly likely to come down next year as the past large rises in energy and food prices are unlikely to be repeated. But the Bank will need to be tough to dampen core inflation, especially the services component. Fitch expects the BoE to raise rates to 4.75 per cent by May 2023 and does not anticipate any pivot to cuts until 2024. Paul Hollingsworth: The BoE will have to look through falling headline inflation next year and focus on likely still-strong underlying inflationary pressures. As a result, we expect it to continue to increase interest rates even as economic activity deteriorates. We assume a peak in Bank rate of 4.25 per cent in Q1, but regardless of the precise level, the key thing for us is that the bar to reverse course is very high — don’t look to central banks to come to the rescue even as the recession takes hold. Ethan Ilzetzki: I expect inflation will be more entrenched, and the BoE will need to raise interest rates to a greater extent than the Bank and markets currently anticipate. Dhaval Joshi: Monetary policy works with a lag of around 6 to 12 months, so it will only be in 2023 that we feel the full impact of the monster tightening in interest rates that have already happened. In that sense, the BoE will not need to hike rates much more in 2023. DeAnne Julius: It will need to raise Bank rate to the point where it is above the 2-year forward rate in the markets — ie, into positive real territory. Stephen King: Tougher than it thinks . . . it has tended to be too complacent so far. Inflation has proved to be a far bigger challenge than the Bank ever imagined and it may still be behind the curve. Lena Komileva: Recessionary dynamics are destroying supply faster than opening slack in labour markets. Consumption is on a declining trend, but nominal spending is high. Inflation remains excessive, news is encouraging, but still inconsistent with the inflation target. The policy rate is still at a discount to nominal spending and central bank messaging is connecting with markets with mixed success. The Bank will have to fight inflation for longer than markets and policy officials currently expect. Barret Kupelian: We expect that the Bank will keep rates at around the 4 per cent to 4.25 per cent mark for the foreseeable future. The reason why I don’t expect an immediate loosening of monetary policy is because of the unique supply-side issues the UK economy is facing, some of which are likely to persist for a longer period of time with a knock-on impact on inflation. Anna Leach: Having wrongly believed that pandemic-related inflation in supply chains would come off quickly, the Bank has focused on using a lot of words to demonstrate its commitment to the inflation target. Despite the level and persistence of UK inflation relative to other countries, the Bank has nonetheless lagged others in driving up interest rates at pace. Given that a large proportion of UK inflation is domestically-driven, it would suggest the BoE has more work to do to drive down inflation. But the sharpness of the decline in real incomes will do a lot of the work to drive down demand over the next year, meaning interest rate rises may be less needed. Prudence suggests the Bank should err on the side of caution, given its past policy errors. All being well, a terminal rate of 4 per cent in the first half of the year should be sufficient to bring inflation down sustainably to target. Warwick Lightfoot: The UK, in common with other advanced economies, has an inflation challenge that needs to be dealt with by an active programme of disinflation that will involve positive real interest rates. Moreover, leaving aside policy questions relating to price stability, once inflation is lowered it needs to return to normal monetary conditions with positive real short-term interest rates of around 2.5 per cent at the short end of the yield curve, in order to return to money and capital markets that function properly without distortion and the malign effects of the scramble for yield. John Llewellyn: Quite tough, because the legitimate issue of relative pay (nurses) has become intertwined with the issue of absolute pay (train drivers). So now everyone is paying the price for that failure of governance. Gerard Lyons: The BoE may not need to be too tough as inflation has peaked, the economy is slowing, monetary policy tightening over the last year is still feeding through, and further quantitative tightening has already been announced. Because central banks globally — including the BoE — were too complacent two years ago, wrongly believing inflation would be transitory when it was clear at the time that it would persist, there is a danger that they may be too aggressive now and tighten too much. Although the question relates to the cycle, the broader issue is a more structural one: the need for the economy to adjust to the end of cheap money. Since 2008, monetary policy has become the shock absorber for the economy, with low policy rates and excessive quantitative easing, contributing to asset price inflation, to markets not pricing properly for risk, leading to an inefficient allocation of capital and allowing the recent bout of inflation to take hold. Stephen Machin: Since inflation looks like it will be coming down as some of the big base effects drop out the index then (in the absence of further big shocks) it will not have to be as tough as it recently has been in the coming year. Chris Martin: I suspect that inflation will peak at a lower level than expected but will persist for longer than in comparable countries. The BoE will likely continue to steer an uncomfortable path in order to suppress demand enough to suppress inflation while trying not to further damage an already weak economy. David Meenagh: With the decrease in commodity prices and a lack of demand inflation is likely to fall in 2023, so the Bank shouldn’t need to increase interest rates much higher than they already are. Costas Milas: I expect the BoE to raise its policy rate up to 4 per cent. With CPI inflation expected to slowly retreat in 2023, there is a good chance the BoE will cut its policy rate before the end of 2023. Notice, however, that since mid-2016, the real interest rate has been negative which, of course, creates economic and financial distortions (including excessive risk taking). I, therefore, expect that the BoE will be keen, once inflation retreats and approaches the 2 per cent target, to keep its policy rate slightly above CPI inflation. Stephen Millard: The MPC need to continue raising rates into 2023 if they are to curb inflation. I expect rates to reach 4.75 per cent by the time of their meeting in June. Andrew Mountford: Tougher than it needs to be. Professor [Daron] Acemoglu at Massachusetts Institute of Technology — one of the most influential academic economists — argues that the contrasting levels of productivity and wealth between countries stem from the difference in institutional quality (cf “Why Nations Fail”, Princeton University Press, 2012). One thing that institutions need to do is to maintain control over inflation because inflation reduces the quality of information conveyed by prices which is necessary for allocative efficiency. Most of the current rise in the price level is not inflation. The rise in the price of energy is conveying the important information that energy is in short supply and so we should pay more and use less of it in equilibrium. What high-quality institutions should do is make sure that this rise in price level does not turn into general inflation via a wage-price spiral. The economy’s institutional framework together should make sure that firms aren’t expected to fully compensate wage earners for their reduced standard of living, thereby reducing their need to increase prices.  This could be achieved by providing households with a sufficient one-off energy payment to mitigate their loss of real income whilst maintaining the role of prices in reducing demand. This would reduce the need for wage increases and then further price increases. Unfortunately, the UK institutional framework has not managed to do this and so, compared to other developed economies, is experiencing higher inflation, and I believe greater industrial unrest. The BoE is stuck in the middle of this and feels forced to control the inflation process by increasing the costs of investment and other borrowings to firms so that they can’t afford to agree to wage increases. This is a sort of economic chemotherapy which should only be used as a last resort. Damping down inflation and industrial unrest by providing effective one-off energy cost relief would be a much less damaging course of action. It is not too late. Longer-run inflationary expectations are still not high — two and four years ahead are below 4 per cent. John Muellbauer: Given the lower capacity of the economy, demand will need to fall sufficiently. Since the Bank’s model of the economy is hopeless, it will have to feel its way by trial and error and probably be slow to respond. This suggests that policy will be somewhat tougher for longer than currently expected. But much depends on global factors and especially Russia’s war. Gulnur Muradoglu: Very tough. Andrew J Oswald: Very. I was a young economist in the 1970s and remember the wage-push inflation, as we called it then, that was caused by workers all trying to keep up with others’ pay rises. Humans haven’t changed since then. They care deeply about wage comparisons. High price inflation is to be expected as wage costs go up throughout the economy. David Page: We forecast the BoE to raise the policy rate by another 75bp in 2023 to a peak of 4.25 per cent. At this level of policy restrictiveness, we expect to see the recession continue into 2023 and a notable easing in a tight labour market. However, we also believe that with the BoE already mindful of the medium-term impact of its policy tightening, it will be the first developed economy central bank to cut rates, expecting the first cut in Q4 2023, once the BoE sees the forecast easing in the labour market begin to emerge and aware that the policy tightening it has enacted will continue to operate with a lag before the full effect is felt. Alpesh Paleja: We expect a little more monetary tightening over the next few months, with interest rates peaking at around 4 per cent early next year. But beyond this, the MPC are likely to pause on rate hikes as signs of an economic downturn become more apparent, and global price pressures continue to fade. But the outlook for inflation is particularly uncertain at the moment, with risks in both directions. If unforeseen events lead to an intensification of global price pressures, or inflation remains entrenched in domestic price and wage setting, the Bank will need to be much tougher to bring inflation down. John Philpott: Not as tough as currently expected. Bank rate will probably rise to around 4 per cent early in 2023 but as the severity of the recession becomes clear and deflationary pressures intensify, the BoE will switch back to rate-cutting mode.  Kallum Pickering: Monetary policy is already sufficiently tight to return inflation to the BoE’s 2 per cent target by the end of 2023. A further tightening, which seems likely at the February meeting, risks overdoing it. Abstracting from the external sources of high inflation, chiefly the global energy supply shock following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the present pace of underlying inflation in the UK is in the 3-4 per cent range. Yes, that is a problem. However, the BoE already tightened a lot in 2022 via Bank rate hikes and via its now fairly aggressive unwinding of quantitative easing. As monetary policy works with a lag, and since there is now clear evidence of a) recession and b) that headline inflation has peaked, further hikes on a risk-management basis would be misguided. Every additional hike going forward merely increases the chance the BoE undershoots its target in late 2023 and is forced to sharply reverse towards easier monetary policy. Christopher Pissarides: I don’t think it should be very tough, definitely not 1980s-style, because of the negative impact on the real economy. Ian Plenderleith: Not too much more: interest rates to peak at around 4.5-5 per cent, as transitory inflationary pressures subside. Jonathan Portes: Inflation will fall back quite rapidly over the year and the Bank may not need to raise interest rates much further, perhaps no higher than 4 per cent. Richard Portes: Not very tough. The housing market will be depressed, despite foolish government attempts to stimulate demand. Unless the war drives energy prices up again, they will fall, and many other goods will be in excess supply. And the recession will deepen. So inflation will fall significantly without further tightening. I fear the Bank may go too far. Vicky Pryce: Given the slowdown in the economy caused by higher input costs to business, steep hikes in energy and food costs to households and the deflationary and recessionary impact of higher taxes and tighter fiscal policy, the BoE needs to do very little more. In any case, raising short-term interest rates has little impact on inflation caused mainly by forces outside its control. But what needs to be watched is the extent of QT that is about to take place. Whatever one may think about the distortionary effects of quantitative easing, I fail to see how the economy would have recovered and long-term yields stayed so low without the massive BoE QE intervention during Covid and beyond. We are now seeing continuing, though diminishing, year-on-year borrowing by the Treasury which is no longer supported by quantitative easing and that is pushing yields up anyway, not just because of the Truss/Kwarteng “mini” Budget turbulence. Thomas Pugh: Inflation is now on its way down after peaking at 11.1 per cent in October. Fuel prices should drop by more than 5 per cent over the next few months due to the reduction in crude prices and a stronger pound. Global food prices have also started to fall, which should reduce food price inflation soon. Admittedly, energy prices will rise by 20 per cent in April but that is a much smaller rise than the 54 per cent increase last April. What’s more, shipping costs have almost fallen back to their pre-pandemic level. All that means that inflation should fall from 10.7 per cent in November to a little under 4 per cent by the end of next year and be back at 2 per cent in early 2024.  However, there is a risk that inflation proves stickier than we think, either because a tight labour market means that wage growth falls more slowly than we expect, or because firms are rebuilding margins. Indeed, the Q4 edition of the RSM UK Middle Market Business Index showed that middle-market firms are getting better at passing on costs. We doubt that the MPC will end its tightening cycle until there is clear evidence of the labour market loosening and wage growth coming down. We don’t think that will be until Q2 next year. As a result, we expect another 50 bps of interest rate hikes in February and a 25 bps rise in both March and May to take interest rates to 4.5 per cent. Sonali Punhani: Our view is that the BoE is underestimating the persistence and strength of domestic inflation and the tightness of the labour market. We expect wage pressures to continue to rise in the near term and remain elevated. Even though labour demand is weakening, labour shortages are likely to limit the rise in unemployment as we expect the fall in participation rates driven by long-term sickness to be persistent. Near-term inflation is likely to have peaked, but we expect inflation to fall only slowly in the next few months and stay above the target in 2023 due to the stickiness of services inflation. So we expect the Bank to continue to raise rates in the first half of 2023 to 4.5 per cent by May 2023. Given we expect above-target inflation to persist, we don’t forecast any rate cuts in 2023, despite a recession.However, we see a risk that the BoE remains dovish as it has over the past few months and hikes rates slower than we expect, which could risk inflation being higher for longer, further sterling weakness and eventually a more prolonged hiking cycle and higher terminal rates. Morten O. Ravn: Inflationary pressures so far continue to be significant in the UK despite commodity price inflation coming down. Labour market conflicts also signal that there is little confidence in the UK’s ability to bring inflation under control. In combination, the Bank will, unfortunately, need to continue its tough stance for longer than otherwise warranted. John Van Reenen: The declining economy will do a lot of the work, but there will have to be some more hikes. Ricardo Reis: Quite tough. The forward rate says a peak at 5.2 per cent, which may well be right, but probably more risk on the upside than the downside. Anonymous: Moderately, inflation will come down. Matthew Ryan: It may be tougher for the MPC to rein in inflation than it is perhaps willing to accept. UK rate hikes may need to continue deeper into the first half of 2023 than the MPC is currently signalling. Jumana Saleheen: Three things will define how tough the BoE will need to be in 2023: good luck, good policy and good communications. I want to start with good communications because I think the Bank can improve the quality of its communications. It could start by holding a press conference following every MPC meeting, just like the ECB and Federal Reserve do. In addition, the Bank needs to find ways to be clearer in signalling the path of future policy — the current (historic) format of leaving the wider public guessing between constant rates and the interest rate path implied by financial markets is not working. The Bank will need to get lucky with the shocks that hit the economy. It will also need to set good policy — in other words, interest rates that are neither too hot nor too cold, but just right. Our expectation is that the BoE will have to raise interest rates by another 100bp next year. We expect interest rates to rise from the current level of 3.5 per cent to a terminal interest rate of 4.5 per cent by spring 2023. This compares to our view of a US terminal rate of 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent. Michael Saunders: After a slow start, the MPC has now done most of the monetary policy tightening that will be needed to return inflation to target. Some further tightening may well be needed, perhaps to around 4 per cent. Given the likelihood that services inflation and pay growth will be sticky, the MPC are unlikely to ease quickly unless the economy weakens very sharply indeed. Yael Selfin: With inflation on course to reach the BoE’s target by spring 2024, there is a risk the Bank will act too strongly. Two further modest rate rises of 25 bps each at the start of 2023, with base rates peaking at 4 per cent, may be sufficient to see inflation gradually falling back to target. The Bank could adopt a wait-and-see posture during the rest of 2023 and act in the event inflationary pressures increase. Andrew Sentance: In my view, UK interest rates will need to rise to at least 4-5 per cent to get on top of current inflationary pressures. We have already moved a long way from near-zero interest rates to 3.5 per cent. But if inflation remains more stubborn then we cannot rule out Bank rate rising to 6-7 per cent for a while. Philip Shaw: All developed economy central banks have been tough in 2022 — that has been a defining feature of the year, especially during the past six months. Given that the stance of UK monetary policy is probably already somewhat restrictive, it is not clear that rates have too much further to rise. One wild card is that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy has shifted over the past few years. Over 80 per cent of the UK mortgage stock is now fixed rather than floating, which means that the impact of higher policy rates is staggered and in this sense, it is worth noting that 4mn mortgagors are due to refix over the next year, mostly at much higher rates. This means that there will probably be a further hit to consumer spending in 2023 as the lagged impact from higher policy rates finally bites. Overall we suspect that the peak in the Bank rate will be limited to 4 per cent. It is quite feasible that the MPC begins to bring rates down towards the end of 2023 to prevent an unnecessarily deep downturn, at least if a sustained surge in pay increases is avoided. Andrew Simms: Simply turning an interest rate screw will only increase the UK’s economic pain without tackling the underlying inflationary pressures, over a problem that will most likely, short of another war or pandemic, sort itself out in the coming year. The BoE has already conceded that inflation is set to fall in 2023, so for that reason alone, further raising interest rates would make no sense. But there are many other reasons for them not to increase the cost of money in a way which will increase unemployment, homelessness and bankruptcies. Chief among these, again acknowledged by the Bank, is that most of the key inflationary drivers are things beyond their control. The fallout from Putin’s war against Ukraine looms large and is also perversely a key reason why inflation will fall later in 2023, as current prices start to be compared to the prices already inflated by the war in 2022. International energy cost and supply chain causes of inflation from the war add to labour supply and product chain blockages resulting from Brexit and the aftermath of the pandemic.  More important for the UK’s long-term recovery is that the Bank should ensure low-cost money is available to fund a rapid transition to create a zero-carbon, high-employment and -wellbeing, energy-efficient, low-waste, circular economy. That implies boosting a greater re-domestication of how the UK meets its needs whether in terms of manufacturing, food or renewable energy production. Nina Skero: We are anticipating two more 50bp hikes, which would bring the Bank rate to a peak of 4.5 per cent by spring 2023. We then anticipate a cut to 4.25 per cent in October 2023 with further cuts to follow in mid-2024. To some extent how far the Bank will have to go depends on how far people expect it to go. If there is an expectation that interest rates will rise significantly, households and businesses may choose to cut back on discretionary spending in anticipation of higher mortgage/debt payments. This would in turn help bring inflation under control, lessening the need for interest rate hikes. James Smith (RF): The good news here is that we seem to be past peak global inflationary pressures and international drivers of inflation could even move into reverse: energy prices have been falling; global goods demand has eased; and supply chain problems are easing around the world (including in China, finally). But what really matters for the BoE is the extent of domestic inflationary pressures, and here the news is more mixed. While households’, firms’ and financial market measures of inflation expectation have been falling, labour-market quantities have loosened only slightly (with vacancies falling and short-term unemployment rising) and nominal wage growth remains unsustainably high. All this means that the BoE is likely to continue to tighten monetary policy in 2023, even if not to anything like the same degree as was the case in 2022. But with major global central banks all acting to reduce the risk of a lasting global inflation overshoot, there is a clear risk that global financial conditions could tighten too much and we could see a sharp reversal in policy in 2023. James Smith (ING): The BoE is nearing the end of its tightening cycle. Inflation has peaked, particularly if you focus on “core goods”, where plenty of categories have the potential for declines in price levels (not just inflation rates) over the coming months. That’s linked to higher inventory levels and faltering consumer demand. At the same time, there are growing concerns about the impact of rate-sensitive areas on the economy as rate hikes continue. Central banks, not just in the UK, are realising there are growing costs attached to “fighting the Fed” and the associated dollar strength we saw earlier in 2022. Fortunately, the market reaction to the Fed’s mini-pivot in December takes a bit of the pressure off the BoE to keep moving as aggressively. As with the entire economic outlook, the jobs market is the main uncertainty, and scope for ongoing labour shortages suggest core services inflation could take time to come down. That doesn’t necessarily require the Bank to take rates much higher than they are now, but it could argue in favour of holding Bank rate at these elevated for longer before cutting. At ING we expect Bank rate to peak at 4 per cent in Q1 but, unlike in the US, we aren’t forecasting rate cuts before 2024. Andrew Smithers: Inflation is likely to slow on current policies, which include continued QT. Alfie Stirling: The Bank doesn’t need to raise interest rates much further, if at all, in order to deliver their 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. There is already a risk that rates have risen too far, too fast and that the coming recession has been at least partly made in Britain. Susannah Streeter: Supersized rate hikes now appear to be in the rear-view mirror, as data filtering through indicates that the rate of price growth is slowing. But although inflation may have reached the peak, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a smooth downward path from here. There is still the potential for plenty of pain ahead as stubbornly high prices continue to cause severe headaches for the economy. In the UK, the yield curve currently suggests further rate rises through the first half of 2023 to around 4.5 per cent before the BoE presses pause and holds the rate steady through to the end of the year. The significant price inflation in services and wage growth in the private sector are both red flagged as risks and, although the economy is weakening with a contraction of 0.1 per cent expected for the last quarter of the year, it’s more resilient than had been expected. Nevertheless, the recession rolling in will dampen domestic demand and so, although inflation is set to stay elevated through the first half of 2023, it seems reasonable to expect, as forecast by the BoE, that it will gradually fall back in line with the 2 per cent target over the course of the next couple of years. It may prove more stubborn though, given many of the inflationary pressures have been external, and energy prices are likely to stay unpredictable. Michael Taylor: Bank rate will peak at no more than 4 per cent. In addition to the lagged effect of 2022’s rate hikes by the MPC the jump in interest rate expectations during the shortlived Truss administration further tightened policy with immediate effects, notably on the housing market. Mervyn King [former BoE governor] dubbed this the “Maradona effect”, where changes in rate expectations mean policy rates don’t have to. Suren Thiru: A painful deceleration in inflation is on the way as favourable base effects, slowing demand and falling commodity prices bring down the headline rate, but at the cost of a protracted recession and notably higher unemployment. We expect inflation to average around 6.3 per cent for 2023, lower than last year but still high by historic standards. This monetary tightening cycle is likely to end by the summer and as recession risks crystallise, policymakers may be forced to pivot from aggressively hiking rates to loosening policy by the end of 2023 to lift the UK out of a damaging downturn. Phil Thornton: The Bank has already been tough and needs to stop raising Bank rate when it gets to 4 per cent — if not before. The danger is now more that it will tighten policy more than is needed and depress economic growth even further than is needed to hit the 2 per cent target than it fails to counter inflationary pressures that are receding. Anna Titareva: Following the 50bp hike in December, we expect another two hikes in 2023 — 50bp in February and 25bp in March, bringing Bank rate to 4.25 per cent. Samuel Tombs: The MPC probably has done enough already to bring CPI inflation back to the 2 per cent target within the next two years. Surveys now show that businesses are responding to the weakness of demand and the jump in their debt servicing costs by laying off staff. The MPC, however, likely will err on the side of caution, given the rise in inflation expectations in 2022. As a result, we expect it to raise Bank rate to 4 per cent in February, and then keep it at this very restrictive level for the rest of 2023. Kitty Ussher: Most of the hard work on interest rates has already been done. The Bank’s own models now indicate that inflation is likely to return to its medium-term target without much further action. The problem the Bank has is now one of perception, which may lead it to over-tighten. Because of the time lag between raising rates and the full impact on the real economy, combined with the mathematics of base effects working their way through, it will not be until the second quarter of 2023 that businesses and households fully believe that inflation is falling. In the gap between now and then, the Bank may feel under pressure to keep taking action, running the risk of inflation undershooting its target in 2024 and an unnecessarily harsh recession. Keith Wade: Much tougher than they have been so far. Past experience shows that a significant downturn in activity is needed to bring inflation down from these levels. Supply-side factors such as Brexit and the pandemic have made the task more difficult as the required slowdown in demand is now greater than before. Unfortunately, the Bank has yet to grasp the nettle, has moved too slowly and is allowing second-round effects on inflation to develop. Sushil Wadhwani: The BoE’s forecasts are puzzling. Their own DMP survey displays forecasts for wage and price inflation that appear to be too high to be consistent with their forecasts. The BoE’s stance that current market forecasts for interest rates are probably higher than what the economy needs is likely to be challenged. Ross Walker: There is already a substantial amount of policy tightening in the pipeline (ie, announced Bank rate hikes which have yet to feed through to mortgage debt-servicing costs), so we expect only modest Bank rate rises (to a 4.25 per cent peak). The MPC’s “guidance” around whether ‘forceful’ action is required — and what, exactly, constitutes that — risks becoming incoherent. Martin Weale: I expect Bank rate will go to between 4.5 per cent and 5 per cent. Simon Wells: Although inflation has probably peaked, we don’t expect it to fall within 1 percentage point of the BoE’s target before end-2024. Wage pressures and global supply-side headwinds could keep core inflationary pressure elevated for some time. History shows it is rare for inflation to fall from double digits to under 3 per cent in less than three years. But with the BoE forecasting higher unemployment, and tighter monetary policy set to bear down on demand, policy rates could be approaching the peak. One more 25bp rate rise in Q1 next year may be all we get before a pause, although the market is pricing in considerably more than that.  Michael Wickens: It is still in catch-up mode so it will continue to raise rates for the first part of 2023. Inflation is then projected to fall and the US will stop rate increases, which will allow the Bank to stop too. Trevor Williams: Rates will hit a peak of 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent. Quantitative easing will do the rest of the job of tightening monetary policy. Evan Wohlmann: Very. The BoE will likely further raise its policy rate in 2023, and we expect the rate to peak at 4.5 per cent. Monetary policy will remain tight throughout the year given high upside risks to inflation even as we expect headline price growth to start to ease. While a wage-price spiral is unlikely, domestic pressures — including high core and services inflation and strong underlying pay growth — may not be consistent with a rapid return to the 2 per cent target. Like most central banks, the BoE will be mindful of the risks from a premature loosening of financial conditions, particularly as we expect a heightened sensitivity in financial markets to UK policy decisions will continue for some time. Linda Yueh: The BoE has been fairly robust in its rate rises in 2022, so 2023 should see it ease the pace while it seeks the “neutral” rate in order to balance controlling inflation expectations with a recessionary economy. Azad Zangana: About half of the UK’s inflation is temporary and caused by external factors such as energy prices, but the other half, which is still very high, is caused by demand in the economy being too strong relative to supply. Too much money chasing too few goods. The BoE would have to be very tough to bring inflation all the way back to target in 2023, raising rates to 6 or 7 per cent. But this risks causing a crash in the housing market, and even triggering another banking crisis. So the Bank is more likely to allow inflation to fall more gradually, minimising the risk to financial stability. Fiscal policy: Will the government need to announce further tax raises in 2023 to maintain sound public finances? Kate Barker: Uncertain. Most likely not as the present fiscal policy leaves some room for disappointment. Nicholas Barr: Yes — in the face of 12 years of underinvesting in public services combined with rising political pressures to fix things, higher taxes are necessary, desirable and inevitable. My worry is not that taxes will rise, but that their burden will fall more on low and middle incomes than I would choose. Ray Barrell: Tax increases will eventually be needed to finance sensible public sector wage increases. The public finances are probably sound and debt markets are stable. The government has signalled it is willing to deal with deficits appropriately. There is no rush to raise taxes when growth is slow, but it must be done soon. We can only hope that the neoliberal right of the Tory party has learnt lessons from the failure of Trussonomics. Charlie Bean: It will need to raise taxes in the medium term, as the implied squeeze in real public spending that is presently assumed in the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts is, in my view, unsustainable. But the government does not need to actually raise taxes in the near term. All that is really required is a credible plan to put the public finances on to a sustainable (declining debt-GDP ratio) trajectory in the medium term. The Sunak/Hunt combination seems to have largely undone the damage caused by the irresponsible Truss/Kwarteng “mini” Budget and that should afford them a bit more “wriggle room” in managing the public finances. Martin Beck: We think the economy will perform less weakly than the OBR expects, which should translate into a lower level of public sector borrowing during 2023 than the OBR has forecast. This and the risk that lifting the tax burden to an even higher level could undermine the economy’s capacity to grow means the government needn’t and shouldn’t think about further tax rises.  David Bell: The government will strive to avoid further tax rises. Hiking taxes in the year before an election would reduce even further the chances of re-election. Some shifts from capital to current spending or a gentle increase in borrowing are the more likely outcomes. Aveek Bhattacharya: Market fears seem to have eased since the turmoil of the autumn, and as the year progresses it seems likely that limiting the damage of the impending recession will be a greater priority than raising taxes — quite aside from the political challenges of passing further tax rises just now. Danny Blanchflower: No, as the economy will slow fast and they will likely have to raise spending sharply. Philip Booth: As all the fiscal sustainability reports show and as some of us have been saying for 25 years, the demographics are such that it will be very difficult to balance the fiscal books. There will need to be tax rises or spending squeezes over the next few years, but there is a limit to the extent to which taxes can, and should, rise. Andrew Brigden: UK fiscal policy is finely balanced, as Kwasi Kwarteng’s ill-fated “fiscal event” of 23 September made clear. Our central scenario assumes that no further fiscal tightening will be required, but that depends crucially on the outlook for long-term real rates of interest, which have risen globally since the beginning of this year, and by some 250 basis points in the UK. For now, financing costs faced by the UK government remain a little below the UK’s trend rate of growth, and in that world a country can run a primary deficit indefinitely. But the gap between the two is much closer than it has been for some time. If UK long-term real rates of interest move above the UK’s trend rate of growth, which we see as around 0.75 per cent, then a tightening of fiscal policy may be needed urgently. George Buckley: No. Robin Carey: In such a turbulent economic landscape, the current government will need to ensure that the tax burden is fairly shouldered by the wealthier parts of the population. In particular, the government will need to focus on ensuring that large corporations overseas are paying tax for income generated in the UK and prevent tax avoidance through offshore funds. Jagjit Chadha: Given national preferences for a better health and social care system, a need to build infrastructure and an increase in debt service costs, there is a need to raise taxes in line with total managed expenditure. The earlier this is done, the more we will be protected against any further negative income shocks.   Victoria Clarke: The outlook for UK public finances is still much more uncertain than normal amidst the scope for large moves in energy prices and in annual changes in inflation, economic growth and interest rates. In addition, spending policy decisions could further shift the fiscal outlook. This is important since the degree of fiscal ‘headroom’ is small, so the government remains vulnerable to the possibility that even small changes in forecast assumptions could leave the government with more fiscal repair work to do to show debt-to-GDP on a decisive downward trajectory. However, we suspect that HM Treasury will avoid further tax changes in 2023. If there is more fiscal work to be done, the government may favour building this into spending reductions, rather than tax cuts, but in a heavily backloaded way again. David Cobham: That depends on whether the government gets real about the pay of nurses and other public sector workers: if it does, it may need to increase some taxes. If it does not get real, it will be deliberately worsening the UK’s meagre public services as well as impoverishing public sector workers and weakening consumer demand, which will lower the economy’s taxable capacity and reinforce the UK’s current status as a failing state. Anonymous: Having moved abroad, I have lost track of the different waves of fiscal announcements. In the 1970s, inflation created a distributional conflict between the unions and the employers. Today the distributional conflict impacts the budget, potentially impacting both the spending and the revenue side of the budget. Electoral considerations may well lead to some relevant adjustment (see eg NHS), involving higher taxation. Diane Coyle: Yes. And to maintain minimally acceptable public services. Bronwyn Curtis: No government wants to raise taxes coming up to a general election, so I think it is unlikely that they will do anything even if public finances deteriorate a bit. Paul Dales: I suspect the government has done enough to achieve its self-imposed fiscal rules. That said, if it finds itself having to increase public sector pay by more (which seems likely given the strikes) then taxes may need to be raised to cover the cost. Richard Davies: I don’t expect this, no. A lot of work was done in the autumn and I expect HMG to want to stick to that path. Howard Davies: As the election approaches the strategy set out in November will come under strain. How credible is it to push off real cuts in public spending until after the election? But I do not think the government could implement further tax increases even if they wanted to. Panicos Demetriades: This cannot be ruled out as there remains considerable uncertainty around the global outlook, while the UK’s fiscal stance remains vulnerable to market sentiment which can push borrowing costs higher. Once again, these risks emanate, in part, from remaining question marks over the competence of the UK’s economic policy management, notwithstanding Sunak’s better record than his predecessors. Colin Ellis: Hopefully not! Barring negative shocks, the UK government seems to have shored up market sentiment after Kwarteng’s horrendous policy blunder (that is the polite version of what I call it). Somewhat ironically, I think the inflation we are living through right now will make life a bit easier for the government, overall, in terms of the public finances.  Martin Ellison: The bond market vigilantes taught the government in September 2022 that sound public finances are essential. It’s likely that the government will eventually cave into public sector wage demands, in which case tax rises are inevitable. Noble Francis: The new chancellor’s reversal of the “mini” Budget policies and the Autumn Statement policy changes, combined with the OBR analysis of policy impacts, are likely to be sufficient to maintain public finances and the credibility of the financial markets. Furthermore, they should allow for a small degree of government stimulus in 2023 with an election due within two years. Marina Della Giusta: Not likely. Anonymous: No. Andrew Goodwin: Given there’s so much uncertainty around the supply side and how much of the weakness identified by the OBR will prove permanent, it would be a mistake to tighten fiscal policy even more than is already planned. Regime change and the switch to a more orthodox approach have restored market confidence and there’s no need to go any further. Paul De Grauwe: It would be a great mistake to increase taxes further when the UK economy is likely to experience a recession in 2023. This would only aggravate the recession without positive effects on the budget. But the fact that this would be a mistake does not prevent it from happening. Oliver de Groot: No, the government does not need further tax rises in 2023 to maintain sound public finances. However, the government needs to ensure that any fiscal support measures (whether existing or new) are better targeted. Brian Hilliard: It should but is unlikely to. If it were to raise taxes further it would feel obliged to cut spending further. The cuts it has already announced are not convincing and even deeper ones would be even less so. Paul Hollingsworth: Our GDP forecast for 2023 (minus 0.9 per cent) is somewhat less pessimistic than the OBR when it comes to the depth of the recession. On that basis, it’s not obvious that the chancellor will be forced to announce significant further tax increases in the March Budget. That said, pressures on the public finances are likely to remain in the medium term, not least because we think the OBR is likely overly optimistic about the strength of the underlying recovery over the next five years as a whole. Ethan Ilzetzki: There is no need for further tax rises to maintain sound public finances. The current HMT plan is sufficient. Dhaval Joshi: Depends on the depth and length of the recession. DeAnne Julius: No, I expect tax revenues to come in higher than the OBR forecasts as long as gilt yields remain at current levels or below, so there should not be a need to raise taxes in 2023 to meet the government’s fiscal rules. Stephen King: The risk to the government’s fiscal plans is an inability to hold the line on public sector pay. If there’s a big overshoot, there may have to be fiscal tightening elsewhere. Lena Komileva: Higher than expected inflation and nominal growth will provide a cover for the deep structural adjustment to fiscal spending that likely lies beyond the next election. Barret Kupelian: Probably not. However, this assumes that government does not offer a one-off payment to healthcare professionals and other professions linked to government pay due to the cost of living crisis. Anna Leach: With the government having already announced significant future consolidation, the spring Budget needs to focus tight government resources on how growth will be driven in the medium term. We need detailed plans for driving green growth, particularly following the Inflation Reduction Act and given Europe is likely to take its own action to match subsidies. The priority must be to shape the tax and regulatory system to enable businesses to thrive, which in itself will deliver sound public finances. Warwick Lightfoot: No. The government over the last year has already announced a significant discretionary increase in taxation. The fiscal challenge for the UK will be to return the ratio of public expenditure to around two-fifths of national income on average. How public expenditure is financed by taxation and borrowing is a second-order question. John Llewellyn: It need not; but it well may. Gerard Lyons: No. There is no need for fiscal policy to be tightened any further in 2023. The best way to maintain sound public finances in 2023 is for policy to help ensure the downturn, or recession, is as short and shallow as possible. This points to neither repeating the failed years of austerity or further tax increases. The tax take, already high, is set to rise further, with the income tax system not being indexed to take account of inflation. Also, the rate of corporation tax is set to rise from 19 per cent to 25 per cent. Previously when this rate fell, the tax base widened. Now, this higher rate will apply across a wider base, hitting business competitiveness, especially when included with the UK’s unattractive investment incentives. The high ratio of debt to GDP leaves the government’s finances vulnerable to either a deterioration in the growth outlook or to higher borrowing costs. Although the ratio of debt to GDP will rise this year and possibly next, its future trajectory should be downward as growth recovers in future years and rates stabilise. This negates the need to tighten fiscal policy further. It is important to avoid procyclical policy where weak growth exacerbates worries about the deficit and prompts further fiscal policy tightening. Stephen Machin: Yes, but at the moment whether and how the government would do so seem highly uncertain. Chris Martin: They should, but I doubt that they will. Even if they wanted to, I expect fractures within the Conservative party to prevent action on this.  David Meenagh: The government shouldn’t be raising taxes, as this will produce a worse recession. The government should be borrowing to increase spending, and then paying it back when the economy recovers. Our research has shown that using countercyclical fiscal policy in tandem with monetary policy can stabilise the economy. Costas Milas: I hope not. Looks more likely to me that the government will do additional borrowing. This is because Sunak and Hunt have calmed down markets so they can afford to do so. It will help, of course, if credit rating agencies “cancel” their earlier announcement of placing Britain’s credit score into “negative watch”. Stephen Millard: Given the falls in real income for households over the coming year, I can’t imagine that the government will announce any further tax raises. If the fiscal position worsens by more than is already expected, then they may announce tax rises for 2024 or beyond or they may change their ‘fiscal target’ to improve the fiscal position. Andrew Mountford: Yes, but the difficulty of raising taxes in a recession is that you are asking people to pay out more in taxes at a time when they may be short of money or liquidity. Potentially, therefore, via credit multipliers, this may deepen the recession. This is why a tax on wealth that is only paid when the assets are sold (ie not necessarily during the recession) but which nonetheless immediately adds to the government’s balance sheet (as a share of an asset) is the obvious thing to do. In the UK this would be most practically achieved by taxing the value of land. Land cannot be moved to evade taxation and the ONS estimates the value of land and assets-over-land to be significantly more than £5tn compared to a GDP of a little more than £2tn. Thus, an annual 1 per cent tax would be worth about 2.5 per cent of GDP and so could back a substantial annual flow of public spending backed by additions to the stock of public owned assets which can be realised later. There is a long list of potentially productive public spending projects on, for example, energy, health, training, education, transport and IT provision.    I say this every year and I reiterate again this year because 1) it remains true, 2) it is especially relevant given the worsening government balance sheet, 3) as an academic economist I feel I should emphasise issues where economic theory is able to make strong recommendations and 4) because I found it interesting to learn from reading UC Berkeley’s Professor [Brad] Delong’s Slouching Towards Utopia (Basic Books, 2022, p. 181), that a similar tax was proposed by Joseph Schumpeter to deal with Austria’s post-first world war fiscal problems, and wanted to share this with those who have scrolled down this far! John Muellbauer: The government needs to expand the tax base, mostly obviously for property taxes, but lacks the courage to do so. It will try to muddle through. Gulnur Muradoglu: Probably not, due to election pressure. Andrew J Oswald: Probably. David Page: Probably. The OBR calculates that the chancellor has only around £15bn in headroom to meet his new fiscal rules — a historically small margin. On top of that, the OBR’s economic forecasts look somewhat optimistic over the medium term (admittedly beyond next year) and this may also impact the calculations. It is likely that additional fiscal tightening will be required across 2023, and probable that some of that will be delivered in the form of tax increases (as opposed to further spending cuts).   John Philpott: The recession will hit the public finances by more than expected. The government is now in a bind, which makes it difficult to keep the public finances in check without further depressing the economy. I would announce neither further tax rises nor spending cuts on the assumption that in the context of mounting economic weakness a temporary additional rise in public borrowing will be considered justifiable by the financial markets. Kallum Pickering: No. The medium-term UK fiscal position is not worse than the average major economy and is largely sustainable. The fiscal consolidation announced in the Autumn Statement on November 17 was only necessary to shore up credibility after Truss and Kwarteng’s misguided fiscal plan in late September. Now that confidence has returned to UK markets, fiscal decisions should depend upon near-term economic developments — especially inflation and the shape of the recession. Christopher Pissarides: No. It should wait until the resolution of more uncertainties, such as the war in Ukraine, economic relations with China as it comes out of lockdown, and then decide on the basis of more accurate forecasts of the future path of public finances. Ian Plenderleith: No, so long as it can maintain confidence in sensible fiscal management. Jonathan Portes: No. There is no need to raise taxes in the short term, especially given the likely sharp slowing in the economy. Over the medium to longer term, the UK needs structurally higher tax revenues. As the current crisis, not just in the NHS but in social care, crime and justice, and education, shows, these are needed to deliver decent quality public services in the face of demographic pressures. However, this would be best achieved by radical tax reform, and it is vanishingly unlikely that this government will undertake any such thing. Richard Portes: No — though it may say it must. Absent the “moron premium”, the UK can issue without any major strain. And we should. Vicky Pryce: The government will be raising a considerable amount of extra revenues through its stealth taxes in 2023. In any case, it will not need to tighten much further as its own fiscal rules are in no way constraining. The only worry will be a market reaction to the UK needing to continue to borrow year after year through the OBR’s forecast period while the BoE also engages in QT, flooding the market with bonds that it tries to remove from its balance sheet. But markets may worry even more if the prospects for the UK economy are reduced even further by extra tax increases unless they are targeted to say tackling the non-doms or more “windfall”-type taxes.  Thomas Pugh: Not in 2023, but it is likely to have to raise taxes further ahead. The OBR estimated the trend rate of growth at 1.75 per cent, which seems optimistic given the impact of Brexit and the probably permanent drop in the workforce. If trend growth were closer to 1.5 per cent, it would mean the economy was about 1 per cent smaller in the medium term and would easily be enough to wipe the £9bn headroom against the fiscal target that the OBR factored in. Throw in higher pay demands and increases in budgets and it seems very likely that taxes will rise again over the next five years. Sonali Punhani: I don’t think so. After the government’s reversal of more than half of the “mini” Budget’s unfunded tax cuts, the appointment of a fiscally credible prime minister and chancellor, as well as its announcement of a credible fiscal plan, risk premia on UK gilts and sterling assets seems to have subsided. It does look like markets judged the path for the fiscal policy set out in the Autumn Statement to be credible. Now public finances could deteriorate in 2023 if the downturn is worse than expected or energy prices shoot up, but given we are likely to be in a recession and close to an election year, I suspect the bias would be towards more fiscal loosening rather than tax rises.  Morten O. Ravn: Hopefully not. If the recovery gets under way in 2023, further tax rises should be avoidable, but there will be very difficult choices to be made between tax rises and further spending reductions. John Van Reenen: Probably — higher than planned spending is almost inevitable. But I suspect given the election coming, they will try to quietly put it on the deficit. Ricardo Reis: No. It might, but it does not have to. Anonymous: Yes. Matthew Ryan: Hard to call, but I suspect more perhaps on the way though the government intend to extend energy support beyond April. Jumana Saleheen: The Autumn Statement reversed most of the measures announced in the “mini” Budget. It allowed the government to pursue mild easing in the coming two fiscal years. It also announced fiscal measures that put UK debt to GDP on a downward trajectory by the end of the OBR’s five-year forecast period. At present these changes are sufficient to signal sound public finances (without further tax rises in 2023). That said, should the macro environment turn out to be worse than expected, the government may need to consider tax rises in 2024 and beyond. Michael Saunders: The government’s stated plans — if they stick to them — will probably be enough to restore public finances to a sustainable trend even with low potential growth. The problem is that it is unlikely this government or its successor will want to stick to the stated plans, especially the large and ill-judged cuts to public investment. Assuming a more realistic path for public spending, some further tax rises would be needed eventually. But the better solution would be for the government to get serious about tackling the UK’s low potential growth. Until that is addressed, the UK will be stuck with a rising tax burden and/or meagre growth in public spending.     Yael Selfin: The government decided to postpone the majority of the measures required to consolidate public finances until the next parliament. While it is unlikely to meet the fiscal rules it set up in November, it may not need to act fast, especially as it may be counterproductive to increase the tax burden during a recession. Andrew Sentance: I don’t think we need more tax rises in the UK. That isn’t the right response when the economy is moving into recession. Public finances need to “take the strain” when the economy is facing difficult times. The time for repairing the damage to public finances is when the economy is recovering — which will not be until 2024-25. Philip Shaw: No. The politics of the current situation suggests that the chancellor only gets one shot at tightening fiscal policy and the action taken at the Autumn Statement is likely to be it until the election. One might feel that the UK is a little unlucky in the sense that a relatively high proportion of the national debt consists of index-linked gilts and that RPI inflation is rampant — alongside energy related support, higher debt servicing costs have been a primary contributor towards the increase in forecasts of the deficit over the past year. However, we would have to point out that is not a one-way street as the low-interest rate and inflation environment generally in prior years has tended to helped Britain’s public finances in the past. Andrew Simms: It has already been argued compellingly that the so-called black hole in public finances currently being used to justify a second wave of austerity is a dangerous politically motivated fiction, and the result of a statistical artefact of accounting, rather than an economic reality. The gap emerges from the difference between unreliable forecasts and self-selected government targets of permissible debt-to-GDP. Yet, such targets often change. One piece of recent analysis demonstrates that simply reverting to the underlying measure of debt used to set the target to that used by the government until January 2022, not only makes the black hole disappear, but credits an extra £14bn to spend. Further taxing the useful, productive economy would be counterproductive. Rather we should be seeing tax incentives to propel a more rapid transition to a dynamic green economy. This would not only encourage the kind of genuinely sustainable economic activity needed to shore up public finances, but insulate the economy better from being undermined by external energy price and supply shocks. That said, for the UK to make the transition to a modern, zero-carbon, high-wellbeing economy, the adage of “tax less what you want more of, and more what you want less of” should be applied. Windfall taxes on the super profits of fossil fuel energy companies could go directly to make Britain’s leaky homes more comfortable and energy efficient. MPs on the all party parliamentary group on the Green New Deal recently called for the level of taxation on oil and gas firms to be permanently raised to 70 per cent. Nina Skero: Given the extent of tax rises and threshold freezes already announced, it is hard to see the tax burden increasing even further in 2023. If fiscal tweaks need to be made, ideally they would be done on the expenditure side, in particular via efficiency savings. However, we have seen over and over again that this is much easier said than done. James Smith (RF): Significant tax rises will come into effect in April, reducing typical household incomes by around £1,000. These will land disproportionately on middle-income households: families in the middle-income quintile will see their incomes fall by 2.3 per cent as a result of tax rises, whereas the top 5 per cent will only see their incomes fall by 2.0 per cent. On top of that, government borrowing increases may not be as bad as feared given the falls in the yield curve since the Autumn Statement. This, plus political opposition to further tax rises, means that we’re unlikely to see further large-scale tax increases in the spring Budget. On top of that, if — as seems likely — inflation falls sharply and the labour market loosens as the recession builds, it is likely that measures to support the economy will be needed, rather than tightening fiscal policy through further tax rises. James Smith (ING): The chancellor will no doubt be hoping that a calmer market interest rate environment and the lower debt-interest forecasts that should entail can allow him to water down some of his longer-term spending cut plans — many of which could prove challenging to implement. But while debt-interest estimates should come down, and our GDP forecasts (at the margin) are a little more optimistic than the OBR’s for next year, the official forecaster’s medium-term growth forecasts look too optimistic. In practice that’s going to keep the pressure on the government to look at tax rises, whether that’s next year or in subsequent ones. In the shorter-term, there’s a fair chance that the cost of protecting household energy bills will rise once again next year. Our house view is that wholesale natural gas prices will rise again in 2023 as Europe finds it harder to refill inventories ahead of next winter. Andrew Smithers: Probably not. Alfie Stirling: The government will almost certainly need to announce further spending in 2023, in response to both the short-term pressure from the recession and long-term pressure on public services. It is likely that further tax increases will be needed alongside this. Susannah Streeter: By reversing fiscal easing and raising taxes instead, Jeremy Hunt has steadied the ship through the turbulent waters of a cost of living crisis, sailing away from the market mayhem which erupted following the Trussonomics “mini” Budget. Spiking gilt yields retreated, and the pound has stabilised even though spending cuts were pushed into the budgetary long grass. With the absence of fresh bond market tantrums, fresh tax clawbacks should not be needed. Instead, support for struggling sectors should be prioritised over the coming year. The aim should be to ensure that sustained growth returns sooner rather than later, given that an expanding economy has greater potential to buoy government coffers over the longer term, rather than more salami slicing on incomes which will limit consumers’ appetite to spend. Michael Taylor: There will be no need for further tax rises in 2023; the public finances are on a satisfactory long-term path and higher taxes would be inappropriate for a weak economy. Suren Thiru: The chancellor is likely to remain constrained by recession and the accumulation of debt, which saw him compound the economic misery facing the country by cutting back on public investment over the next five years. The government remains short of money and with the looming recession likely to further weaken government revenue, the potential for further tax rises in the spring Budget should not be discounted. Phil Thornton: No. It has already enacted steep taxes and heralded cuts in spending that risk a repeat of the damaging austerity programme of 2010. These will depress growth and affect the poorest households the most. The government is probably prevented from allowing borrowing to rise to cater for greater public spending (as it did during Covid-19) because of the echoes of the disastrous economic programme of Liz Truss that undermined the confidence of the financial markets in the current administration. Anna Titareva: That’s not currently in our baseline. Samuel Tombs: The fall in expectations for interest rates and gilt yields since the Autumn Statement suggests that debt interest spending in 2023-24 will be about £10bn lower than anticipated by the OBR. At the very least, this should ensure that the chancellor does not need to announce further major tax rises in the Budget in March. Even so, the fiscal consolidation will be intense; the OBR forecast in the Autumn Statement that the cyclically-adjusted primary deficit, as a share of GDP, will decline by 2.5 percentage points in 2023-24, the most since 1981-82, excluding pandemic-distorted years. Kitty Ussher: No. The government has backloaded the fiscal consolidation sufficiently that the stock of debt to GDP will be projected to fall in the medium term in a way that broadly keeps the market content. They will also have some wriggle room if, as seems likely, interest rates do not rise as much as expected in the OBR forecast, reducing debt servicing costs. Keith Wade: This is a risk as government finances are under pressure everywhere as a result of higher rates and the end of QE. The UK will need to maintain a credible fiscal stance in this environment. However, recent falls in oil and gas prices may be helpful for the UK in reducing the cost of the energy price guarantee. Sushil Wadhwani: No comment. Ross Walker: Not in 2023 but probably after the (2024) election. Equally, official fiscal projections are less orthodox than the political rhetoric might suggest so there is probably only very limited leeway for pre-election giveaways. We expect gilt yields to rise significantly in 2023 (10 years to a peak of about 4.25 per cent) as the market must digest substantial issuance. Martin Weale: With an election in sight, I think this is rather unlikely. Simon Wells: Pressures on the public finances will remain intense, and we see no improvement in the fiscal deficit. There are a number of policies implicit in the OBR’s forecast, which sees the deficit shrinking, that may not be realistic. For example, there is no new money for public services despite the recent spate of strike action putting pressure on the government to lift wages. And it is unclear exactly how the government plans to help businesses with energy costs once the current support ends in April 2023. Of course, revenues might surprise to the upside. But on our current forecasts, it will be another year of heavy borrowing. For now, though, the government seems to have done enough to reassure the market after the late-September/early-October turbulence.  Matt Whittaker: Further tax rises may well be required in 2023, but not as a down payment on government borrowing or national debt but rather in order to prop up public services capacity and potentially provide more targeted financial support for households. The terms of trade shock the UK has faced means that pain is inevitable; the choice is how we share we the burden across the country. Achieving the right balance between tax rises and different forms of spending increases is of course political, and it may be that we therefore don’t see further rises in 2023. But almost certainly we should. Michael Wickens: No. The debt-to-GDP ratio would have fallen even without the latest overkill “mini” Budget due to highly negative real debt service interest rates and a positive primary surplus. Just do the maths! Trevor Williams: No — it may have gone too far in raising taxes. Evan Wohlmann: The government’s 2022 Autumn Statement sets out an ambitious 5-year fiscal consolidation which in our view is a step towards demonstrating the UK’s commitment to fiscal prudence. That said, the government has little headroom to meet its debt-reduction target amid very high uncertainty around the economic outlook and strong social and political pressures to further raise government spending. At the same time, the domestic political environment is likely to become more polarised over the coming election cycle which may complicate efforts to deliver on the spending cuts and tax rises outlined in the fiscal strategy. As a result, we expect UK government debt will remain consistently above 100 per cent of GDP over the coming years. Linda Yueh: This is hugely uncertain and depends on the continuing cost of living crisis and global energy prices as well as the scale of the recession. If further income support for households and firms is needed, then the government would likely need to consider more tax increases to put in place in the years after the recession ends. Azad Zangana: No. We believe that when the OBR took the market-derived profile for BoE rates, it inherently became too pessimistic. The BoE has already stated that it will not raise interest rates that high. By the March Budget, the OBR’s forecast should become more optimistic on growth and inflation, raising the forecast for tax receipts, and proving the government some room to manoeuvre. Reasons to be cheerful: Will we see green shoots of recovery starting by the end of 2023? Silvia Ardagna: Unemployment increase will be very modest. Kate Barker: Exports may pick up as the global economy starts to come to terms with the energy shock and, who knows, business investment may rise as capital stock needs to be replaced and labour has become relatively more costly.  Nicholas Barr: If any, small, few and fragile. Ray Barrell: In 2023, we are likely to see slightly disturbed earth rather than green shoots. Output will probably stop falling in the second half of 2023 and may even rise quarter on quarter at the end of the year. Charlie Bean: Only if your crystal ball is made of green glass . ..  Martin Beck: Falling inflation during the course of next year, and the support to real incomes this will offer, should enable the economy to return to growth in the second half of next year. With other countries also benefiting from global disinflationary pressures, the UK will also gain from a pick-up in activity in other economies. David Bell: Recovery is unlikely. The source of any revival in demand is unclear. Consumer demand will be suppressed due to falling real incomes; investment, already weakened by increased uncertainty, will come under further pressure as public sector capital spending enters a long period of decline; a trade-based recovery is dependent on improved prospects in overseas markets and smoothing of the relationship with our main trading partners. Aveek Bhattacharya: Barring some dramatic geopolitical turnround, eg a substantial fall in energy prices, things do not seem likely to look better this time next year. The “green shoots” might just look like things no longer getting worse. Danny Blanchflower: Seems plausible if the government and the MPC U-turn. If not, then the recession will be deeper and longer lasting than the five-quarter-long Great Recession. Sadly, this is worse than the Great Recession, which is precedent. The MPC still hasn’t worked out that a 1 percentage point rise in unemployment lowers wellbeing much more than a 1 percentage point rise in inflation. Only grounds for optimism is whether economic policies from 2022 are put into reverse as the economy collapses and living standards fall. The concern is that strikes turn into broader social unrest. No green shoots anywhere. Philip Booth: Yes, there is unlikely to be another energy price shock and the BoE has taken some action in relation to inflation. The government could help a lot if it liberalised house building. Andrew Brigden: We see UK GDP bottoming out around the final quarter of next year. We are doubtful that green shoots will be in abundance at that time, but 2024 should at least feel better than 2023, which contrasts with the even bleaker picture painted by the BoE. George Buckley: Across Europe, the survey evidence has been less pessimistic than we had thought it might have been. Conditions remain weak, but perhaps not as weak as first thought, and there’s signs that we might even be passing the worst. Note the rise in the composite purchasing managers’ index survey and improving, albeit from very low levels, consumer confidence across Europe. We expect our forecast recession to moderate in the second half of 2023, so yes, we expect green shoots to be showing through by then. Robin Carey: We will need to enforce change in order to reboot the UK economy in the coming years. We must invest in British industry, and in new technologies that will provide opportunities for well-paid jobs to support our communities. I’d be keen to see more from the “levelling up” agenda, to open up strong and vibrant economies across the UK that will ultimately help us thrive as a nation. Jagjit Chadha: Bank rate may not have to rise as high as the market currently expects to bring inflation on to a path to price stability. As the year progresses, we may also start to see labour market participation increase as savings deplete and the threats from Covid recede. Both of these events may create some further fiscal room. Victoria Clarke: The economy is contracting, but the jobs market has so far been resilient. Indeed, the tight UK workforce reduces the risk that a fall in economic activity fuels further economic weakness, as firms appear more likely to retain workers than lay them off. Inflation is likely to be relatively slow to fall in the UK, but it does appear to have passed its peak. Indeed, supply chain issues have eased, global shipping costs have fallen sharply and goods price inflation is now declining. We should slowly see more of this as 2023 progresses. With pay growth holding up relatively well, we should see an end to the household real income squeeze in the second half of 2023. David Cobham: Maybe by comparison with the pandemic period, but not by comparison with the period before Brexit or, even more, the period before the global financial crisis. Anonymous: A diffuse opinion is that the “inflation tsunami” that started in 2021 may end in 2023. In principle, this may be good news. However, the general slowdown in inflation is likely to coincide with a return to a period of low demand and reduced activity, after the post-Covid temporary hike in consumption is over, given that the pre-Covid macro trends are basically unchanged, if not worsened. Another issue is that, given the hike in price level, some adjustment in wages will be necessary, if anything, to sustain demand, determining the distribution of the cost of higher energy prices in Europe. Fiscal and monetary policy will have to be smart to accommodate this adjustment without erring on either side of the equation — too much, too little demand. Diane Coyle: No, not unless some sanity returns to our trade relations with the EU. Bronwyn Curtis: Yes. I am optimistic that alternatives to Russian gas will accelerate and energy savings will become more institutionalised in Europe. Those who left the labour market during Covid will start returning as incomes are hurt by inflation, and boredom sets in. Paul Dales: Yes. The recession will probably be over before the end of the year, inflation will be well on the way back to the 2 per cent target and interest rate cuts from the BoE will be on the horizon. 2024 will be much better than 2023. Richard Davies: Again, it depends. Do the shoots we care about have deep roots, or shallow ones? I do expect inflation to come down, with many more people experiencing real wage increases, and this, via household consumption, will begin to lift the GDP again. So green shoots, in terms of our recent price shock problem, yes. But the deeper questions, and the real roots of prosperity, come from productivity rising consistently. I am less optimistic here, simply because our productivity performance has been so concerning for the past 15 years and, I fear, may require large policy interventions to solve. Howard Davies: No. I expect a shallow recession, but a long one. Consumer spending will be supported this year by cash-rich households who built up deposits in the pandemic. But that effect will tail off. And the looming prospect of further fiscal tightening will kill off any green shoots that do appear. Panicos Demetriades: Most forecasters predict that the worst will be over by the end of 2023, but that largely depends on the global developments in 2023. If we were to see a rapid end to the war in Ukraine, energy prices would come down and that would reduce inflationary pressures, which would feed into smaller increases in interest rates and a stronger economic recovery. If, however, there is further escalation in the war in Ukraine, the much predicted and desired shoots of recovery by the end of 2023 will not materialise. Sadly, the global economy remains in the hands of politicians who have given us little reason to be optimistic in recent years. Colin Ellis: Inflation should be a lot lower, and hopefully confidence will have bottomed out too. I think the stage could be set for a decent bit of cyclical recovery during 2024. Martin Ellison: I’m very pessimistic on the UK economy. Brexit has done long term damage, energy policy is poor, and the pool of talent in government is at rock bottom. That’s enough glyphosate to kill off any green shoots of recovery. Noble Francis: The second half of 2023 is expected to see a rise in UK GDP as inflation eases. Economic recovery is likely to be slow, however, given poor consumer confidence and after a period of sustained real wage falls combined with the impacts of tax rises. Marina Della Giusta: In creative sectors and arts possibly. Anonymous: Only if the Ukraine war is over by September 2023. Andrew Goodwin: Yes, on the proviso that global energy prices come down in line with futures prices and the BoE doesn’t over-tighten monetary policy. If these conditions hold then we should see the start of a recovery in real household incomes towards the end of 2023. Paul De Grauwe: Few things are more difficult to predict than movements in the business cycle. But yes, there is a possible positive scenario. If the energy crisis is overcome, if inflation declines allowing the BoE to relax, then at the end of 2023 a recovery might be in sight, provided no further policy mistakes are made. Oliver de Groot: The UK economy will begin to see improving economic conditions towards the end of 2023 as a result of cyclical factors. However, the UK economy really needs to see green shoots in terms of potential (trend) output and this should be the focus of government policy in 2023. Anonymous: The second half of 2023 should be a better period for the global economy as inflation pressures subside and the Chinese economy feels the full effects of reopening. Brian Hilliard: Probably, because the squeeze on real incomes should be easing. Jessica Hinds: Our forecasts show the UK economy returning to growth in the back half of the year, so the worst is likely to be over. That said, the recovery looks set to be weak, reflecting tight monetary policy, still high inflation and the planned step-up in fiscal consolidation in 2024. Paul Hollingsworth: Following what we expect will prove to be a relatively mild recession by past standards, we expect the UK economy to return to growth in the second half of 2023. However, facing the impact of synchronised monetary and fiscal policy tightening, as well as structural issues such as a scarcity of labour, we expect the recovery from this downturn to be sluggish. Ethan Ilzetzki: It is difficult to forecast one quarter, let alone one year, ahead. Whether the economy recovers will depend on the war in Ukraine, the effects of Covid on the Chinese economy, commodity prices and other unforecastable factors. Dhaval Joshi: Yes, the first green shoots of recovery will appear in the stock market, which tends to look at sales and profits “12 months ahead”. In that sense, I would expect the stock market to begin a sustained rally at some point in the second half of 2023. DeAnne Julius: That depends on developments in Ukraine. If energy prices do not spike higher due to further Russian action, then inflation will fall steadily, which should enable the BoE to hold rates, rather than increase beyond 4 per cent. Stephen King: Anything’s possible — who knows what will happen to gas prices, for example? But the bigger challenge is a deteriorating trade-off between output and inflation. So I’m not so cheerful! Lena Komileva: The recession will not be felt equally across society and it will hurt various income brackets differently. Moreover, neither fiscal nor monetary policy will be able to aid a recovery in an environment of structurally weak growth and high inflation due to deglobalisation, climate change and weak immigration. Barret Kupelian: Inevitably there are winners and losers in any downturn. But I suspect quite a lot of the national conversation will be explicitly and implicitly driven by the repercussions of the UK distancing itself from its largest and closest trading partner. This ultimately has to do with the fact that UK economic output is smaller than what it would have been had we remained members of the EU, with repercussions on virtually every single economic variable, including on productivity and public finances. Anna Leach: On balance, as inflation comes down over the course of the year, household finances will stabilise, providing a better platform for demand. Other brakes on growth should also ease — supply chain frictions and costs already show signs of improvement, in part as global growth has softened this year. The amelioration of this drag on growth should feed through to companies and the wider economy gradually. Crucially, energy supply for winter 2023 needs to be addressed swiftly to ensure that an energy crunch doesn’t undermine the recovery later in the year. Warwick Lightfoot: In the 21st century, market economies have encountered two massive shocks — the credit and banking crisis between 2007 and 2009, and the public health crisis generated by Covid. Policymakers have weathered both without the social and economic disasters that international capital suffered in the 1930s. And the scale of the fiscal and monetary response to Covid, while igniting an uncomfortable episode of inflation, has returned advanced economies to problems that, in principle, policymakers and central bankers know how to manage, rather than the glimpse of a secular stagnation and a stationary state that was beyond them. For the UK, one piece of good news is that the economic and social costs of the necessary disinflation will be lower than 30 or 40 years ago, because it now has a normally functioning labour market that accommodates shocks through price change rather than principally relying on quantitative adjustment. John Llewellyn: Perhaps. But from a bigger, deeper pit than that of the EU. Gerard Lyons: Yes. As inflation decelerates sharply this should allow scope for a recovery in real incomes and in consumption as the year progresses. This too should improve expectations about the policy environment in 2024. If talk of a resolution on the Northern Ireland protocol materialises, this too will help wider business sentiment. Stephen Machin: Doubtful. The feasible time horizon even for the starting point of recovery to get out the deep problems of economic stagnation facing the UK economy, especially on real wages and productivity, would seem to be longer. Chris Martin: For recovery, the UK economy needs to maintain growth of at least 2.5 per cent for a few years. I cannot see that happening while we remain in what is in effect a policy regime of managed decline. David Meenagh: The economy should start to recover towards the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth. Costas Milas: I am optimistic in that we might see the economy expanding from mid-2023 onwards. The reason relates to a number of economic activity predictors, not often discussed by the financial press. First, an up-to-date, for December 2022, measure of financial stress in the UK, which monitors the volatility of bond prices, stock prices and exchange rates, has declined dramatically. Second, a measure of economic policy uncertainty in the UK, based on articles published by the UK press, has also declined in December. As noted by the academic literature, both measures have predictive power for UK growth up to 20 months ahead. So things might turn out better than predicted by most forecasters. Stephen Millard: I am expecting the UK economy to be in recovery by the end of 2023. But I do not expect this recovery to be one in which the economy grows particularly strongly. It will just stop contracting! Andrew Mountford: Something I find frustrating in the discussion of growth in the current affairs media is the over-analysis of the latest datapoint. Will growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 be positive compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, or the third quarter of 2023? Possibly. But this really is of second- or third-order importance. What really matters is the path towards sustained long-run growth. For the reasons given in the first question — poor private investment, a sicker, less productive workforce, low public good provision, high inequality and poor industrial relations — the prospects of sustained high growth rates are not at all good.  If one needs reasons to be cheerful, then one has to look to the very long run. Brown University’s Professor [Oded] Galor, my adviser, in his book The Journey of Humanity (Penguin Random House, 2022), convincingly argues that the world is evolving towards a high human capital, high productivity growth path, where investment in education, skills and training are highly productive and highly valued. The UK has benefited a great deal from this evolution as students and high skilled workers have been attracted here. The UK is thus well placed to further gain in the future . . . if its education, skills and training sectors are provided with enough investment to maintain its position as one of the leading providers in the world. John Muellbauer: It is exactly the green aspects of public and private investment that are lacking in the UK. While global supply constraints are likely to ease and global inflation come down, without an end to Russia’s war, it is hard to see robust green shoots in the UK [in] 2023. Andrew J Oswald: I doubt it. There are too many cost pressures to feed through to prices, and confidence will start to be lost in the idea that buying property is a one way bet. David Page: Yes. We do expect the recession to end and (modest) positive growth to re-emerge by year-end, not least as we forecast inflation falling materially over the course of the year and relieving some of the real income squeeze currently weighing on consumers. But we caution that with ongoing restrictive policy, both monetary and fiscal, a rebound in annual growth in 2024 is only likely to be modest. Alpesh Paleja: Broadly, yes. We expect the economy to have emerged from recession at that point, as lower inflation alleviates the squeeze on household spending, and capital spending begins to recover. But there remains considerable uncertainty around this judgment, particularly around the pace at which inflation will fall back. Green shoots also need to be viewed in the context of the longer-term challenges facing the economy: continually weak productivity, capital spending, trade intensity and potential growth. Urgent action is needed here to boost the UK’s growth trajectory. John Philpott: Yes, but only if both fiscal and monetary policy respond in a timely and appropriate manner to the deflationary pressures that emerge in the first half of the year. Kallum Pickering: Yes. The UK and wider European recession is the direct consequence of the global energy supply shock triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is not a normal business cycle downturn. As such, the normal dynamics do not apply. The combined impact of policy measures to dampen the near-term shock, especially for households, combined with longer run adjustments by businesses and consumers through the price mechanism, points to a recovery starting from late spring and onwards. The big risk next year is that an excessive tightening by the US Fed triggers a nasty US recession rather than a shallow one. A lasting hit to US performance would hurt global trade and the European recovery. Christopher Pissarides: Unlikely, although there might be small improvements. It depends on how the labour market issues causing strikes now and shortages in some sectors will be resolved. Ian Plenderleith: The bizarre feature of the present landscape is the combination of low growth and high employment. I don’t really understand how a high employment recession works, nor what it leads to. So I would expect we will see not a very severe or prolonged recession, but a pretty feeble recovery when it comes, probably by the end of 2023 — not green shoots, just a bit of scrubland. Jonathan Portes: Yes, the near-term gloom may have been overdone. By the end of 2023, barring further large negative shocks, things should have stopped getting worse, and most people should be seeing rising real wages. The UK’s longer term structural economic problems remain, however, and the government does not appear to have any meaningful strategy to address them. Indeed, as regards the impacts of Brexit, it appears — as does the opposition — to prefer to pretend they do not exist. Richard Portes: We may have an Arctic cold wave then . . . But the fall in inflation should improve consumer confidence, and surely investment has to rise some in due course despite the Brexit effect, which will persist. So provided the cold doesn’t kill the shoots, maybe. Vicky Pryce: I see few green shoots except that inflation will drop sharply as it will do in other countries too through the year. Otherwise a combination of still-high, though falling, inflation and higher taxes will lead to substantial further falls in disposable incomes, and consumer and business confidence will remain subdued. Moreover, the poor manufacturing performance over the last couple of years, coupled with loss of trade to the EU will mean that any promises of levelling up cannot possibly be fulfilled in any meaningful way. Thomas Pugh: One crucial point is that not all recessions are created equal. We expect a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of around 2.5 per cent. That would be slightly smaller than the early 1990s recession, but significantly less than the global financial crisis, and a fraction of the pandemic. We think it will be the fourth quarter of 2023 before the economy starts to grow again. But it will be early 2025 before the economy regains its pre-pandemic level. One eventual upside is that many unproductive companies, which have survived by rolling over cheap debt, will fail now that interest rates have risen sharply. Though this will deepen the recession next year, it will eventually allow the resources which had been hoarded by these firms to be redeployed to better uses. Sonali Punhani: The UK economy can recover at the end of 2023 and in 2024 as inflation normalises, allowing the BoE to begin cutting rates to get closer to neutral. But we think the recovery in growth is likely to be modest, as the economy is expected to face a fiscal consolidation from 2024 onwards, along with lagged effects of monetary tightening. Moreover, UK growth should also continue to be constrained by Brexit’s impact on trade, business investment and labour shortages. Morten O. Ravn: There are some green shoots in the latest US numbers signalling that the Federal Open Market Committee may be able to avoid continuing aggressive fed funds rate rises. One would hope that this spreads to other countries, UK included. John Van Reenen: Yes. Hopefully the war in Ukraine will end by then. Ricardo Reis: Yes, as energy prices may well fall. And maybe, finally, we will have some reforms that have some potential to boost growth. Anonymous: As fuel prices come down, green shoots will emerge. Matthew Ryan: I believe that economic activity will hold up better than anticipated globally throughout 2023. Modest growth to return in the second half of 2023, once inflation rates begin to return towards more “normal” levels. Jumana Saleheen: We expect the UK to enter recession in the third quarter of 2022, and to last for six quarters, until the end of 2023. By the end of 2023, we do expect green shoots of recovery, at least in the forward-looking data. As with any recession, necessity is the mother of invention, and there will be winners and losers. The winners will be defined by their ideas, innovation and ultimately productivity. Another reason to be cheerful is that the long-term returns in financial markets have improved. Rising interest rates and slowing growth in 2022 gave rise to losses in almost all major asset classes. But now that we’ve been through that significant re-pricing, there are silver linings as we look ahead to long-term annualised returns for sterling investors over the next decade. Michael Saunders: Unless energy prices fall sharply, it is unlikely the economy will provide reasons to be cheerful in 2023. My hope — I put it no stronger than that — is that the current economic weakness will prompt a much stronger and more realistic debate on the need to lift the UK’s low potential growth rate. As a country, we need to listen more to the economic advice of the experts, OECD and IMF, rather than adopt half-baked schemes, eg Liz Truss. The UK has already had a lost decade, and needs a more serious and evidence-based approach to supply-side policies if we are to avoid another lost decade. Yael Selfin: We expect the UK economy to contract until the end of 2023, with the first quarter of growth in the first quarter of 2024. However, the fall in output in the second half of 2023 could be very mild. Unemployment is also expected to remain relatively low, protecting households’ main incomes. Andrew Sentance: Too early to tell. Recessions are unpredictable in terms of depth and length. But I would hope so. Philip Shaw: Probably yes. The recession is what some might term a “cyclical recession”, not a “balance sheet recession” as per the global financial crisis. With the banks in good shape, lower interest rates will help to stimulate demand when inflationary dangers have passed and the time comes to ease policy. The downside risks are that: 1) supply chains become dysfunctional again, perhaps due to the Covid situation in China; and 2) UK labour participation rates remain low, both of which would choke off supply. Either of these situations could delay a cut in interest rates as a boost to demand under these circumstances would result in higher inflation not healthier economic growth. Andrew Simms: Recovery suggests returning to a prior state of health, but even before the war in Ukraine, before the pandemic, Brexit or even going back to before the 2007 financial crisis, the UK economy has seen its benefits distributed in a highly unequal way, consistently missed opportunities for win-win environmental upgrades, and been marked by wasteful, debt-fuelled overconsumption. So the question is not whether we can return to some prior, sick economic state, but whether we can see the green shoots of genuine transition to a more equal, wellbeing-oriented and ecologically viable economy. Here, oddly, I do see some reasons to be cheerful if we can hold on to some of the lessons from the lockdown years, as traumatic and difficult as they were, about what individuals, firms, communities and governments are capable of when circumstances call on all groups to flex their agency and full capabilities. The greenest of shoots from living through the pandemic is that we learned we are able to transform not just the economy but our day-to-day lives almost overnight — putting public health and wellbeing before short-term economic interest. Companies converted production lines to serve a public purpose: brewers and cosmetics firms made hand gel, fashion companies made personal protective equipment and even Formula One engineers made low cost breathing aids. Local authorities redesigned town centres to favour walking and cycling over polluting private car access, and gave more space on streets to local businesses. Momentum is growing for vibrant, healthier car-free cities. Flying for business, and the cost, carbon and time it consumed, was virtually ended as we connected online instead. Most people radically altered how they lived to help others and put public safety first, with millions taking the opportunity to rethink what mattered in life and seek to escape the “work and spend” consumer trap. A shorter working week was normalised for many and there was something of a reskilling, with more people relearning how to cook, make and repair things, entertain themselves and help others through local mutual aid groups — many of which are still active. We were also reminded that, with public backing, science can move rapidly to find and implement solutions, and that the state has the capacity to enable and make things happen at scale and speed. It can, for example, end street homelessness, find resources and compel the banking system to support rather than drain the real economy — and it can even be the wage payer of last resort. The green shoots are there, but they need to be watered and not trodden on. Nina Skero: The economic situation will get worse before it gets better, but there is light at the end of the tunnel as it seems that the recession we are probably already in won’t be particularly harsh. We are anticipating positive growth figures in the third and fourth quarter of 2023 as inflation already shows signs of easing and other downside risks also begin to fade. James Smith (RF): Global inflationary pressures are likely to ease through 2023, and could even go into reverse. If that happens, falls in real incomes will be smaller than expected, reducing the extent to which consumers need to retrench and the BoE will raise rates. Such a scenario would mean a shorter recession and offers the prospect of a return to growth in the second half of the year. But there are many downside risks to such a scenario including an escalation of the war in Ukraine and widespread disruption from ongoing strike action. James Smith (ING): This is first and foremost a cost of living shock, and that picture should start to look better by the end of 2023. We’re forecasting headline inflation to end 2022 at roughly 4 per cent, and wage growth is likely to stay robust, albeit less strong than it is now. Assuming the jobs market does indeed weather this recession better than some past instances, owing to the very tight starting point, then there are reasons to be hopeful that economic output should have troughed before the end of next year. Andrew Smithers: Not on current policies. Alfie Stirling: Absent another unforeseen supply shock, the rate of inflation is likely to fall during 2023, allowing policymakers to focus more on supporting the wider economic recovery and family finances. Susannah Streeter: Green shoots in the UK economy will be hard to glimpse in 2023, but roots will be taking hold. As inflation dips back towards 5 per cent by the end of the year, price pain will ease for consumers and companies. Warmer weather in the spring and summer could reduce economic sensitivity to energy prices. Added to this, storage capability has improved, and Europe has managed to find alternative energy supplies incredibly quickly, highlighting a nimbleness in energy policy that could act as a protection against future energy shocks.  Tentative signs of greater co-operation with Europe, such as collaboration on offshore wind development, could show signs of acceleration as the UK government attempts to spark growth. Prospects of a deal being clinched on the NI protocol in the spring are looking up, which marks a thawing of relations and would help boost the pound. The FTSE 100 is expected to dip back as the effects of the recession take hold, as even international revenue streams won’t fully protect UK listed companies from the impact of the contraction. However, there may begin to be some respite on the stock market in the second half of the year as the price spiral dips. Added to this, consumers are looking more resilient on both sides of the Atlantic, and while output over the first half of the year will disappoint, there is a chance that growth in the latter part of 2023 could defy expectations as central banks reach peak interest rates, inflation cools off and rates start to fall. Rate rises in emerging markets happened first and have gone much higher. With signs that inflation is peaking, we see greater scope for rate cuts in the emerging world, given that the hikes in emerging markets happened first and have gone much higher. This should support outperformance by some emerging equity and bonds markets. Michael Taylor: By late 2023 the MPC will be cutting rates from the peak of 4 per cent, possibly to 3.5 per cent by year-end. Inflation will be falling towards, if not reaching, 2 per cent and recession will have cooled the labour market. Real incomes will have stabilised. As 2023 draws to a close the economy will be emerging from recession. Suren Thiru: The cost of living crisis could start to ease by the end of the year as inflation drops back, boosting consumer spending power. A larger than expected drop in energy costs would accelerate this improvement. The looming recession could be shorter and shallower than expected if households boost economic activity by spending more of their “unanticipated” savings accumulated during Covid lockdowns, or if the rate of precautionary savings is lower than is typical during downturns. Phil Thornton: Hardly. The fiscal tightening will exert a large drag on the economy through 2024. Growth may return towards the end of the year but this will etiolated strands of grass rather than a lush meadow. Anna Titareva: We expect a relatively slow recovery in the second half of 2023, with GDP growing 0 per cent quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2023, and 0.1 per cent quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2023. Samuel Tombs: The recession should be drawing to a close as 2024 approaches, though the subsequent recovery will be sluggish, given the drawn-out nature of the shock to households’ disposable incomes from mortgage refinancing. Kitty Ussher: Yes. By the time spring is firmly established, there will be a fillip to sentiment from heating being turned off, universal credit being uprated by CPI, and a belief that inflation has peaked, ending the need for further interest rate rises. This will improve consumer confidence, leading to greater discretionary spending, and give businesses a clear run to enact investment plans. On top of that, we will have a pragmatic technocratic government desperate to prove economic competence in the wake of the “mini” Budget car crash. Unless something dramatic changes, the second half of the year is likely to be much more positive than the first half. Keith Wade: Green shoots are more likely in 2024 when monetary policy eases. Sushil Wadhwani: One of the more important factors that might warrant us feeling more cheerful would be peace in Ukraine. The impact of that on commodity prices and confidence could transform the economic outlook for 2024. Ross Walker: Maybe. Spring 2024 is perhaps more realistic, given the likely de facto ongoing monetary tightening taking effect throughout 2023, lagged Bank rate rises feeding through to higher debt-servicing costs. Martin Weale: Perhaps. Simon Wells: Hopefully, the recession will be shallow. The labour market is still tight, some households should still have healthy savings buffers accumulated through the pandemic and inflation is on the way down. But monetary policy works with long and variable lags. The rate rises through 2022 may only have their peak impact on economic activity from the back end of 2023. Reflecting this, we see a pretty lacklustre 2024, even if the economy should start recovering in the second half of 2023. Matt Whittaker: The front loading of MPC activity in recent months may well mean that inflation comes down a little more rapidly than has been supposed in many projections. This will ease the burden on households, relative to expectations, and might mean that we end 2023 with some signs of hope for real-terms income growth. Yet households’ high levels of debt mean rate rises bring, with a lag, a different form of pressure in the shape of repayment burdens. Getting the balance right between controlling inflation and avoiding a household debt hangover will be a critical determinant of the duration and depth of the living standards squeeze. But it is far from an exact science, and both monetary and fiscal policymakers will need to display great dexterity through the year if we are to end 2023 with green shoots of recovery. Michael Wickens: Yes, but not if they are “green”. Trevor Williams: Some sectors won’t see a fall in output, like fintech and gaming, and maybe food and drink. Evan Wohlmann: We expect annual CPI inflation to moderate to around 4 per cent by December 2023 and real GDP to return to, albeit modest, annual growth in 2024. While higher interest rates will significantly dampen consumption, UK households benefit from relatively high levels of net assets to disposable income which will help mitigate against more adverse macroeconomic outcomes, and we expect only a gradual rise in the unemployment rate over the coming years. That said, we expect the UK’s longer-term economic challenges, including from Brexit and the potential permanent reduction in the UK’s labour supply arising from higher rates of inactivity following the pandemic, will keep real GDP growth below its potential rate, of 1.5 per cent, until 2026. Linda Yueh: Provided that the global energy shock recedes and the cost of living crisis ameliorates, then the recession should start to ease by year end. Fiscal policy can help support incomes and stimulate investment, so there is merit in setting out a growth strategy in early 2023 that can set the economy on a course to recovery. Azad Zangana: The green shoots of recovery should start to appear by the middle of 2023. Inflation will have fallen considerably by then, but interest rates will still be high. In perspective: What is the best historical comparison for the downturn the UK faces in the year ahead? Silvia Ardagna: History never repeats itself, unfortunately for forecasters. Kate Barker: In my lifetime, the mid-1970s. Nicholas Barr: I can’t think of a UK precedent — the issue is not a standard downturn, but structural adjustment after the pandemic. The thought occurs that the structural adjustment of countries in central and eastern Europe in the 1990s after the collapse of communism might offer some interesting insights. Ray Barrell: The best comparison year to 2023 would be 1981, with high energy prices and tightening fiscal policy producing low growth. Subsequent increased growth came mainly from lower energy prices, and not because of an “Expansionary Fiscal Contraction”. See my discussion in: Barrell, R., (2014) ‘Macroeconomic policy and the 1981 budget: Changing the trend’ in Expansionary Fiscal Contraction: The Thatcher Government’s 1981 Budget in Perspective, edited by A. Needham and D. Hotson. Charlie Bean: Few downturns are exactly alike. While I don’t expect inflation to prove quite as difficult to deal with as in the 1970s, the basic characteristics of the shock are similar to then. Martin Beck: The primary drag on the economy over the next few quarters comes from the impact of high energy prices and inflation. So the closest parallel is with the recessions of 1974 and 1975, in the aftermath of the 1970s oil price shock. That said, the inflationary backdrop then was far worse than the present day, with pay growth in double digits, a wage-price spiral clearly in play and monetary policy unmoored from any inflation goal. David Bell: Perhaps the best comparison is the 1973 recession when GDP took 14 quarters to return to its pre-recession level. A combination of an energy price rise and industrial disruption led to high inflation. Unemployment was 3.5 per cent between August to October 1973, and 3.7 per cent between August to October 2022. The steady increase for the remainder of the 1970s is unlikely to be replicated in this recession, which unusually coincides with a period of excess demand for labour. Aveek Bhattacharya: I can’t think of a good historical comparison. This is a bit like a terms of trade shock, but the UK has its own currency and the privileges of being an advanced economy. The combination of high inflation and falling GDP makes this seem a bit like the 1970s, but the huge falls in real wages in prospect, coming on the back of such a long period of stagnation, mean that analogy doesn’t quite work either. Danny Blanchflower: The Great Recession of 2008. There are striking similarities in the utter incompetence of the MPC that failed to spot that inflation was transitory and drops in output were much worse on both occasions — fiddling while Rome burns once again. Philip Booth: The mid-1970s, when there were simultaneous supply shocks with mismanaged monetary policy. George Buckley: UK recessions have typically been much larger than the 2 per cent we expect this time round. However, the most modest of the UK’s previous recessions was that experienced during the early 1990s, when GDP fell by 2.7 per cent from peak to trough. So we think there will be similarities between the current downturn and that of the 1990s in scale, but similarities with the 1970s recessions in terms of causation, ie war-related energy shocks. Robin Carey: The current socio-economic challenges facing the UK are unprecedented, and unlike those we have seen in the past. However, certain obstacles facing us, such as rising inflation and decreasing levels of investment, do recall the “winter of discontent” that came at the end of James Callaghan’s government. Jagjit Chadha: Interesting question. In 1726, the British economy suffered its third recession of the decade. A number of shocks contributed to the downturn. Real GDP fell by 3 per cent in 1726 and by 0.6 per cent in 1727. The downturn was quite diffuse. Source: “Dating Business Cycles in the United Kingdom, 1700-2010”, Stephen Broadberry, Jagjit Chadha, Jason Lennard and Ryland Thomas, Economic History Review (forthcoming). Victoria Clarke: There is no one historical period that encapsulates our view of 2023, although there are similarities with different periods across history. There are commonalities with the early 1990s recession, with our forecasts showing a similar annual decline in GDP, in a relatively shallow recession. We continue to view high inflation as the primary force driving the contraction in GDP, amidst a significant and continued real income squeeze. The inflation of 2022, which continues into 2023, has mixed origins, both in supply-side issues and on the demand side. Firstly, supply chain disruption post-pandemic lifted inflation, with these inflationary forces added to by the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy prices. Resilient demand has also been a factor underpinning the strength of inflation, although we expect much weaker demand in 2023. There are similarities with the energy price inflation of the 1970s, but there are also important differences with this period too. The tight UK workforce, and the relatively small rise in unemployment that we expect to see, do not fit neatly into one historical box. Indeed, the rise in participation has turned on its head a multi-decade trend of rising UK workforce participation. Finally, turning to the housing market, it is notable that the weakening housing market that we expect this year will not be added to by rising unemployment, in our view. This underpins our view that the fall in house prices will be relatively shortlived. David Cobham: It’s difficult to think of any other postwar UK downturn caused by poor supply-side policies (Brexit) on top of very poor demand-side policies (austerity). Anonymous: The temptation of looking back to the 1970s is misleading. The institutional framework is radically different — no financial repression, and higher participation. In financial markets, higher household debt, no capital controls, no large aggressive unions, a technology that is arguably more adaptable, and a clear perception of the costs of inflation in this context. Episodes of geopolitical fragmentation cutting production chains and market links could provide some insight, but none fit in my view. Diane Coyle: Late 1970s. Bronwyn Curtis: There is no historical comparison. There have been multiple shocks to the UK economy over a relatively short period of time. The combination of the introduction of quantitative easing, Brexit, Covid and an energy shock has created more challenges than I have seen before. Paul Dales: Probably the one in the mid-1970s, when there was also a nasty mix of high inflation and a global recession. During that downturn, real GDP contracted by 1.9 per cent. Richard Davies: The best advice is to beware of historical comparisons. We haven’t seen anything quite like this before. What is unique is the combination of a strong labour market — low unemployment, high vacancies — with weakening output and underlying weak productivity. This rules out the comparison with the 1970s and the early 1990s, for example. Go back further than this and comparisons break since the exchange rate, and flow of capital, was so different. So economists need fresh thinking, rather than historical playbooks. Howard Davies: It is tough to find an analogue for what we face now. We are in uncharted waters. Panicos Demetriades: This is a very tough question. I believe the global economy and, in turn, the UK are in uncharted waters. The oil shock of the 1970s wasn’t due to war and Russia was never the country that [it] is today. Even in the depths of the cold war, there was less uncertainty and more predictability. In the UK, we have never had such a poor record, including abrupt U-turns, in macroeconomic management. Having said that, the monetary policy framework, not just in the UK but also in all developed economies, is now much stronger than it was during the 1970s, due to the adoption of inflation targeting. This offers legitimate hope that inflation will come down much more quickly than it did in the 1970s. Colin Ellis: This is a tough one. It doesn’t feel as destabilising as the 1970s, yet. Hopefully, the overall downturn will be relatively shallow, if long-lived — maybe more treading water than drowning. Martin Ellison: The Great Depression. Noble Francis: The most appropriate historical reference point for the UK economic contraction in 2023 would be the 1970s. However, the current economy is considerably more dependent on consumption than on production than in the 1970s. This certainly isn’t 1990 or 2008 and this economic contraction is not likely to be as large. Marina Della Giusta: The mid-1970s situation. Anonymous: 1974-75. Andrew Goodwin: Our forecast of a 1.3 percentage points peak-to-trough fall in GDP is much shallower than all of the other recessions of the past 50 years. The key difference this time round is the absence of serious imbalances that characterised most of the previous downturns. Paul De Grauwe: The stagflation of the 1970s is one historical comparison. It was a period of negative supply shocks pretty much like today. Another historical comparison is the decision of the British government in 1925 to return to the gold standard. This policy mistake led to a decade of low growth in Britain. Brexit was probably a worse policy mistake that will put Britain on a low growth path for years to come. Brian Hilliard: One doesn’t really come to mind. The mix of factors leading up to this recession is unique. Jessica Hinds: The 1.5 per cent peak-to-trough drop in GDP that we expect in 2022-23 is most similar in scale to the recession of the mid-1970s. Paul Hollingsworth: While high inflation and widespread industrial action hark back to the 1970s-80s, we think the UK is facing more of a 1990s-style recession in terms of its depth. That said, we think the recovery is likely to be more sluggish than back then. Ethan Ilzetzki: Knowledge of history should guide our analysis and policy, but I don’t think straight-up historical comparisons are useful. While there are some similarities to the 1970s, central banks had a different role and strategy at the time than they do today, and the structure of the economy is very different. The labour market may now be in the midst of a supercycle of scarcer labour and reliance on imports from China is more tenuous. Dhaval Joshi: 2023 = 1982 Because: 1) in 2023, just as in 1982, central banks are obsessed with killing inflation even if the price is a deep recession; 2) financial markets in 2022 behaved identically to that in 1981, so it is a perfect set up; and 3) very strong geopolitical parallels, eg Russia-Ukraine war = Iran-Iraq war. DeAnne Julius: Because employment is so strong as the UK goes into recession, I expect this to be the shallowest recession in recent UK history with the total reduction in GDP much smaller than in either 2008-09 or 2020-21. Stephen King: 1973-74 or 1979-80. Yes, there are big differences, but a huge terms of trade shock, a refusal to accept inflation might be a serious problem, a miserable productivity record, deteriorating industrial relations, a government scrabbling for ideas . . . I could go on . .. Lena Komileva: The 1930s. Anna Leach: It’s a relatively mild downturn overall — the smallest projected decline in GDP by the standard of recent recessions, but one underpinned by some notable records: namely, the level of inflation, the highest in 40 years, and the pace of the decline in living standards, worst on record. That mix makes it hard to pick an easy comparator. Energy is the dominant driver of the weakness, so perhaps the energy crises in the 1970s might be the best period of comparison. Warwick Lightfoot: The best comparison is the 1970s. The collapse of Bretton Woods led to a huge injection of liquidity in the world economy, the Nixon administration’s politically charged “we are all Keynesians now” and a Federal Reserve that was behind the curve in the conduct of domestic monetary conditions combined to set off a general American-led inflation and commodity super price cycle. This was then amplified by a war in the Middle East that raised energy costs further and reduced the terms of trade and living standards of the wealthy western democracies. John Llewellyn: There is none, because on no previous occasion did the UK choose to make it more difficult for itself to export to its major market. Gerard Lyons: Naturally the 1970s, given the havoc caused by high inflation, and the need to address stagnation. But there are also important lessons to take from other periods, too. The danger is the UK may experience a triple deficit problem. We have been used to a twin deficit problem — a high budget deficit alongside a trade, or current account, deficit. Now, the challenge is: what happens to the private sector’s balance sheet? This is critical. Thus there are lessons from the [Nigel] Lawson boom and bust of the late 1980s. For instance, in the late 1980s the economic consensus and the markets were very upbeat with chancellor Lawson’s boom, because of the great shape of public finances — with a budget surplus. As was clear at that time, not enough attention was being focused on the huge build-up of the private sector’s liabilities. Then, there was a large rise in private sector debt, including consumer credit and mortgage equity withdrawal. Likewise, what happens to the private sector balance sheet now will be critical. Also, the post-second world war era is relevant in terms of misplaced current concerns about public finances. Then the ratio of public debt to GDP was high, and the lesson from then is the crucial need for sustained economic growth to bring the public finances into shape. Stephen Machin: There isn’t one. There are some common components with aspects of previous downturns. But the current overall picture is very different in a number of important dimensions, in particular, to do with the labour market, scope for productivity growth and the country’s position in the global economy. Chris Martin: With luck, the 1970s. Most likely, the 1930s, for the length of time that the economy stagnates. David Meenagh: The downturn shouldn’t be very deep, though fairly long lasting. Costas Milas: My feeling is that the downturn will be slightly lower than what we experienced in 1990-91. Stephen Millard: Hard to think of an exact comparison. Maybe the early 1990s recession, although the fall in real income at that time was much less than the fall in 2022-23. John Muellbauer: Two historical episodes are relevant: the oil shocks of the early 1970s and the post-Thatcher recession of the early 1990s, which followed the 1980s house price and credit boom and high levels of indebtedness of UK households. The rise in nominal interest rates, and hence in debt service costs, led to a major mortgage market crisis and record arrears and repossessions. Gulnur Muradoglu: 1970s, high-inflation period with strikes. Andrew J Oswald: The oil shocks of the 1970s. David Page: In many ways each downturn is unique and no historic comparison is perfect. The 1990s provides some analogy with a significant energy shock and coming off an overheating economy. However, the 1970s is more obvious, with severe supply side shocks and significant overheating. That said, we do not expect a downturn as severe as either of those episodes and are hopeful that the adjustment likely necessary in the labour market will not prove as severe as either of those. Alpesh Paleja: There doesn’t appear to be one, really. We expect the downturn to be relatively mild and shortlived, with output falling to a smaller degree than the recessions in 2008-09, the 1990s and the early 1980s. Though, of course, it may feel much worse for many vulnerable households and businesses. The UK economy saw a few shortlived contractions in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem more comparable to this recession — though, of course, that was a very different economic environment. John Philpott: All downturns and recessions are unique, so historical comparisons are always somewhat problematic. In some ways, the current economic situation resembles the late 1970s, which led to the big fiscal and monetary squeeze of the early 1980s and the subsequent recession. However, today’s flexible deregulated labour market virtually rules out the threat of wage-price spirals from real wage resistance so that deflationary policies work more effectively, thereby limiting the required hit to output and employment assuming fiscal and monetary is conducted sensibly. Kallum Pickering: A major global energy supply shock, political crisis, a war with global consequences, surging inflation and rising interest rates. It is common to hear people say either that the UK is heading back to the 1970s, or that it never really solved the problems that led to the 2008 financial crisis. But those periods were defined by major problems with underlying fundamentals. That is not the situation today. Today’s problems feel much more like the early 1990s — back then, it felt as if the world was coming to an end. But by the mid-1990s the economy was booming. The lesson from history is clear, present circumstances are no guide to future performance! Christopher Pissarides: Late 1970s and early 1980s are still the best comparison, but policy now is handling it better than back then — at least, we are not likely to call in the IMF to rescue us. Ian Plenderleith: I don’t know of one in recent history — a recession with high employment is sui generis and we need some serious economic analysis to tell us what’s happening and why, and what the appropriate policy response is. But I suspect most of the policy action needs to come on the supply side, eg greater decentralisation and higher immigration. Jonathan Portes: Well, in contrast to some of the overheated rhetoric, it’s not the Black Death. Perhaps 1794-95, when a mild autumn was followed by a very cold winter, and food prices soared as a consequence of a poor harvest and disruption to trade with the continent. As Jenny Uglow wrote, “in many people’s minds the bread shortages were linked to the war, the government and official corruption”. The government refused to legislate for an increase in wages and responded forcefully to the resulting unrest with repressive measures. Richard Portes: No obvious comparison. Certainly not the 1970s, nor the early 1980s, nor the early 1990s. Vicky Pryce: There isn’t a clear and direct historical comparison with what we are going through now. The Covid lockdowns and the supply dislocation that followed were pretty unprecedented. But there are some comparisons of what we are experiencing now in the UK with the late 1970s’ “winter of discontent” at a time of another energy crisis. But then it was mostly, at the beginning, at any rate, started by a series of private sector strikes that then spread across to the public sector, whereas now it is mostly public service workers striking where trade unions are still powerful. And we are unlikely to see a repeat of the hyperinflation we saw in the latter part of the 20th century or the double-digit interest rates of that time. In fact, the main worry now as inflation starts slowing is that we could see a repeat instead of the [George] Osborne austerity post-financial crisis; that could cause serious further and sustained damage to the UK’s productivity and growth. Thomas Pugh: The current recession has a fair amount in common with the early 1990s’ recession. Both were caused by soaring energy prices, rapidly rising inflation and tightening monetary policy. We expect this recession to be the same length, five quarters, and similar in depth — a 2.5 per cent fall in GDP this time versus a 2.7 per cent fall in the 1990s. However, there are some key differences. The economy went into this recession in pretty good shape. Households’ balance sheets are strong, with excess savings worth 10 per cent of GDP, and the financial sector is well capitalised. These factors will prevent the recession from turning into a financial or housing market crisis. Pay growth has been well below inflation this time, which has exacerbated the hit to households’ real incomes but has also avoided a wage-price spiral and reduced the need for very high interest rates. And the tightness of the labour market means that even though unemployment will rise, we do not expect it to surge, especially in sectors experiencing a skills shortage. The labour market is incredibly tight because of a lack of supply of labour, not because of an excess demand for workers. And, given the recent challenges firms have had in recruiting staff, and the relatively short recession, firms will have more of an incentive to hoard labour than in previous periods of economic weakness. The exceptionally tight labour market probably explains why, in this quarter’s RSM UK Middle Market Business Index, 41 per cent of firms said they hired more staff in the fourth quarter, despite the dire economic outlook. All in all, we expect the unemployment rate to peak at about 5 per cent this time, compared to 10.7 per cent in the early 1990s. Morten O. Ravn: The last episode of commodity-driven inflation that we had was in the 1970s. Hopefully, we have learned from the mistakes made back then. John Van Reenen: 1970s — oil shocks and initially tight labour market causing stagflation Ricardo Reis: I don’t know. Anonymous: Second oil price hike in the late 1970s. Matthew Ryan: None in recent memory — certainly not mine! Jumana Saleheen: In terms of the depth and length of the recession, the best historical comparison for the 2023 recession is the early 1990s. We expect UK output to fall by about 1-1.5 per cent in 2023. There will be similarities and differences to the 1990s recession. In terms of differences, the feel will be different to the 1990s. The 2023 recession could be characterised as the “Zoom Recession”, where sectors that benefited the most from the era of low interest rates, such as tech and real estate, end up suffering the most. In terms of similarities, we think that 2023 will be like a typical recession in that we will see the interest sensitive sectors, such as corporate investment, and the consumption of durable goods, electronic and white goods falling the most. Michael Saunders: Such comparisons are likely to be misleading. High inflation and low potential growth have echoes of the 1970s rather than the more recent decades, but the institutional framework — the MPC and the OBR — is much stronger now than in the 1970s. Yael Selfin: In terms of size, the current downturn is expected to be similar to the recession that began in the second quarter of 1990. Then the peak-to-trough fall in GDP was 2.75 per cent, while we expect the current recession to see a fall of 1.9 per cent. These are much milder falls than the 6.3 per cent decrease in 2008-9 and the 4.5-4.1 per cent falls in the 1970s and 1980s. However, in terms of duration, the expected six quarters of contraction of the current recession would be the longest continuous fall in GDP that the UK has faced since quarterly data were first compiled in the 1950s. Andrew Sentance: This is the first inflation-driven recession we have seen since the early 1990s. It has more in common with the mid-1970s, early 1980s and early 1990s recessions than more recent downturns in 2008-09 and 2020. Philip Shaw: Each downturn has its unique features and there is no perfect comparison. However there is a shade of the early 1980s here — inflation broadening out after an energy price shock, strikes and fears over escalating pay deals, concerns about the underlying pace of economic growth, and the need for fiscal restraint. We just hope that the route out of the downturn on this occasion is not as protracted. Andrew Simms: Because the UK faces action on a climate emergency that is unprecedented — civilisation has never before experienced the climate it has created by burning coal, oil and gas — there is no adequate historical comparison. That it has simultaneously to deal with serious inequality and the fallout from leaving the EU and a global energy price shock further complicates any comparison. However, at the time of the 2007-8 banking crisis, there was also an oil price shock and a huge disruption to the global food supply chain linked to extreme weather events. Back then, further harking back to precedents of economic upheaval, colleagues and I proposed a Green New Deal, including financial market reforms and public investment in zero carbon transition, as a fairly comprehensive solution to the UK’s problems. The failure of the government to act back then means vital elements of that important work remain undone.  Worse still, the BoE warns that government plans to weaken banking regulations again risk returning the UK to the reckless pre-financial crash days. Another, more hopeful comparison in terms of having high ambition to solve generation-defining challenges is the UK’s postwar period when, in debt and with a shattered economy and population beleaguered by years of trauma and hardship, the country nevertheless built the NHS, and managed a social housing programme under both Conservative and Labour governments that built more than 200,000 homes a year. The lesson is that, whatever the downturn faced by the UK this year, a realistically funded, Green New Deal-type programme is the best medicine for turning the economy around, levelling up and preparing the UK for the world it has to face. Nina Skero: There isn’t a good historic example of a downturn characterised by a tight labour market, high inflation and a real earnings decline. It is a rather odd combination, which means we once again find ourselves in unprecedented times. James Smith (RF): It’s tempting to compare the current situation to the 1970s. But while this is true in terms of the shocks facing the UK economy — indeed, the rise in energy prices is much larger this time — the different institutions for monetary policy and wage setting should mean the impact of the rise in energy prices on inflation will be far less protracted. James Smith (ING): None of the recent recessions, or downturns [in the] last 30-40 years are likely to exactly resemble the one that we, and most economists, are predicting for next year. In pure GDP terms, the 1990s recession is probably the closest match. The approximately 2 per cent peak-to-trough fall in GDP seen back then isn’t so dissimilar from our forecasts for the 2023 downturn. But more than half of the fall in output in that recession was in construction, and while this is an area that’s likely to suffer next year, it’s unlikely to be the dominant driver. The 1990s recession was also coupled with a 3-4 percentage points increase in the unemployment rate, something that wasn’t matched in the global financial crisis despite a much larger output fall. We’re likely to see a more modest impact in the jobs market this time given the historic starting point of high vacancies, and chronic labour shortages. Labour hoarding seems likely, and reasonably resilient employment numbers should hopefully help limit the scale of the downturn. Andrew Smithers: None; it is unusual to be facing a downturn when the lock of tangible investment in recent years, combined with a deterioration in the terms of trade, imply zero trend growth. Alfie Stirling: I don’t think there is a particularly useful historical comparison. Susannah Streeter: The UK seems to be in a 1970s time warp with runaway food prices, industrial unrest and spikes in energy prices causing economic pain, and [the] recession we are heading for is similar to the contraction the UK experienced between 1973 and 1974. This was triggered by another energy shock — the oil crisis of 1973, which unleashed fresh inflationary forces on top of an expansionary price cycle made worse by strikes and a misguided government attempt to boost growth. The contraction was shorter but sharper compared to the forecast for the recession currently rolling in, but job losses were shallower.  It was followed by a double-dip recession in 1975, and there is still a risk that this coming recession could last longer than currently expected. The OBR’s prediction for a year-long recession was largely based on an expectation that households, which were lucky enough to be sitting on piles of savings, would keep spending, particularly as inflationary pressures ease next year. However, it seems consumers are proving more risk averse, particularly those on lower incomes. At the very least, growth is set to remain sluggish, and inflation is slow to come back to target. Michael Taylor: The early 1980s recession is the last one that included both a material fall in real household disposable incomes and higher interest rates, like now. But the early 1980s recession was exacerbated by a shakeout in manufacturing and a large increase in unemployment, neither of which apply this time. Suren Thiru: We expect the looming downturn to be similar to the last inflation-driven recession in the early 1990s, with a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of around 3 per cent, much milder than the Covid recession and the global financial crisis. Consumer-focused services firms, including those in retail and hospitality, will feel the brunt of the recession as people cut back on discretionary spending. Business investment is likely to contract by more than overall GDP, as company spending on new projects is typically among the first areas to be cut during a downturn. Phil Thornton: The 2009-10 recession and anaemic recovery probably give the best road map. The downturn has not been as severe but the recovery will be as lacklustre. This time, rather than from financial sector failures, it will be the after-effects of a hard Brexit that will hang over the economy for years. A likely housing market correction or crash will not help either. Samuel Tombs: The downturn ahead doesn’t perfectly match any of those before it, but the early 1990s recession provides the closest parallel. As now, the economy was crushed by a combination of excessive consumer price inflation and rapid increases in interest rates to deal with the problem. The housing market also was precariously placed entering the recession, as it is today. Kitty Ussher: 1992 — high inflation, rising interest rates and a monetary policy shock (ERM vs “mini” Budget). However, the situation now is not nearly as bad because interest rates are rising from a much lower base and more of the inflation is externally generated now than was the case in the late 1980s. Keith Wade: All cycles differ, but the current period has similarities with the downturn of the early 1980s when a recession was needed to bring down inflation. Sushil Wadhwani: It is difficult to think of an appropriate historical comparison. The real income shock is, on some measures, worse now than in the 1970s. Further, central banks were not independent then and inflation expectations had been de-anchored for several years by the early 1970s. Ross Walker: The early 1990s recession stemmed from aggressive monetary policy tightening in response to runaway inflation, so that perhaps offers the clearest parallel — though we do not expect the same severity of recession this time. Martin Weale: There is no good comparison. While I am reminded of the 1970s, it must not be forgotten that productivity growth was much better than it is now. Simon Wells: It’s tempting to say the 1970s. Inflation is high and expected to fall, yet the UK is facing a “winter of discontent”. Real wage resistance could add yet another pressure on firms’ costs and unit labour cost growth could rise to levels not seen for decades. This echoes the situation in the 1970s, when pay increases became divorced from productivity and a wage-price spiral began. This adds to other persistent cost headwinds to firms. The impact of Brexit is still reverberating through the economy. Globally, the days of “hyperglobalisation” are behind us and new forms of protectionism have emerged. However, unlike in the 1970s, the monetary policy regime is better equipped to keep inflation expectations anchored.  Michael Wickens: The closest is 1973-5, which was the last time the UK was hit with large negative supply shocks. Most of the other downturns were due to demand shocks, where monetary policy can be much more effective than it is for supply shocks. The message from the 1970s is that the countries that reacted most strongly to control inflation were the first to recover afterwards. They did not include the UK. Trevor Williams: The economic drift before 1981-2 — the UK needs a new economic paradigm. Leaving the EU has been a big blow. Where is the vision and economic strategy for the future? There does not appear to be one. Evan Wohlmann: There isn’t one — the severe energy crisis coming shortly after the pandemic shock presents an unprecedented set of challenges for the UK and Europe as a whole. Linda Yueh: The 1970s, since we are facing “stagflation”, which was followed by a global recession in the early 1980s. But there are differences. As Mark Twain observed, “History doesn’t repeat itself but it does rhyme”. So, there are lessons we can learn from that period and we should certainly try not to repeat its worst mistakes. Azad Zangana: The expected recession is comparable to those seen in the early-to-mid-1990s. More traditional cycles where interest rates are raised to slow growth, to combat inflation. This will come as a relief to those comparing this period to the global financial crisis, or the pandemic. At this stage, we do not see any serious systemic risks that would cause a prolonged recession. However, where this cycle differs is that households have huge excess savings built up during the lockdown period in 2020-21. This is helping to support household spending to outperform expectations. Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Ray Barrell: Diverging downwards from international capital standards and giving financial regulators the remit to improve competitiveness may raise growth a little, but it also raises the risk of another financial crisis. Financial deregulation will give short term gain ahead of an election and long-term pain afterwards. David Bell: Sometime during 2023, the government will recall that it published a “levelling up” white paper in February 2022 intended to “end the geographical inequality which is such a striking feature of the UK”. There may be individual projects that can be highlighted, but the hope of any significant reduction in measurable disparities across regions before the election will prove vacuous. Danny Blanchflower: 2023 is likely to be a disastrous year for the UK economy. My guess is the drop in output will be much greater than in 2008-09 — perhaps of the order of negative 5 per cent, although dependent on policy response. Robin Carey: Sadly, I believe that the difficulties that the UK has been dealing with in 2022 are likely to continue and develop as we move into 2023. As high streets and retail chains continue to collapse, more towns and city centres will struggle to attract business. The growing discontent amongst workers in several industries will likely lead to more of the action we are already seeing as we move into the new year. Jagjit Chadha: The country seems likely to continue with anaemic growth for some years to come. This will contribute to a widening of household and regional inequalities in the absence of a decisive and sustained policy response, which seems unlikely given the events of the “mini” Budget and the caution that has subsequently been adopted. Anonymous: There could be financial issues ahead, both domestically and internationally. Emerging markets may be facing increasingly adverse borrowing conditions, as creditor countries may also be facing deteriorating financial and fiscal conditions, and perhaps some turmoil. If you look for historical episodes that can be of inspiration, think of 1919. The US refused to cancel debt to the allies. These, in turn, charged high reparation payments to Germany. Not directly related to the world today, but a useful reference highlighting the problem. Diane Coyle: The UK is in a structural hole, not a cyclical downturn. Until there is a government with an adequately long-term economic strategy it can get through parliament, economic performance (and prospects for improved living standards) will be disappointing. Paul Dales: Much hinges on what happens to the UK’s labour force. If it starts to grow, then suddenly both the inflation and GDP growth outlook become much brighter. If it doesn’t, then the UK could find itself lagging behind its peers for a few more years. Richard Davies: Housing policy must not be forgotten in all of this. I was struck when talking to people at the Festival of Economics — not a scientific sample, but hundreds over three days — that we are living through a period in which Britons of different ages are talking at cross-purposes. In particular, Gen X and above interpret the cost of living crisis as food and energy inflation. Those that are younger are not talking about groceries when they use the same phrase. They are talking about housing costs. Colin Ellis: It’s probably worth remembering that positive shocks do still happen from time to time. We’ve had a lot of negative ones recently, but sometimes unexpected good things can happen. Anonymous: Without being able to predict the outcome of the Ukraine war, predictions for 2023 are uncertain. Brian Hilliard: The self-inflicted wounds of Brexit and the Truss debacle will leave a long trail of destruction in the economy. Paul Hollingsworth: If there’s anything we can be fairly confident about, it’s that 2023 is unlikely to see a swift return to economic and geopolitical stability. Forecasts will be wrong, but in which direction and by what magnitude, remains to be seen. Headwinds to the economic outlook continue to build, and widespread industrial action over the fourth quarter highlights that the political and social pressures generated by high inflation, and a deteriorating economic backdrop, are significant. For central banks, the biggest challenge will be to calibrate policy tightening in order to successfully, and sustainably, rein in inflation without inflicting unnecessary damage to the economy. In a world where central banks do not have a good grasp on where the neutral rate of interest is, where the natural rate of unemployment lies, whether monetary policy lags have lengthened or shortened compared to history, what the impact of quantitative tightening on the economy is and what the effects of a global synchronised policy tightening on the scale we are currently seeing will be, the risk of a policy mistake is elevated. Elsewhere, I worry particularly about the lasting damage to the labour market from both Brexit and the pandemic, with the significant rise in labour force inactivity due to long-term sickness particularly shocking, and not helping when it comes to inflation. Finally, we are at least more optimistic that the tone of UK-EU relations in 2023 will be more constructive than in 2022, particularly with respect to the NI protocol as we approach the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. Dhaval Joshi: There will be another tail event in 2023. By definition, we do not know its exact nature and timing, but the statistical probability is higher than most people assume. Stephen King: Merry Christmas . . . and my new book, We Need to Talk About Inflation, will be published by Yale in April . . . Shameless advertising! Barret Kupelian: There are quite a lot of other changes happening in the UK, some of which we cover in PwC’s UK economic predictions piece. These include: French workers will overtake the Brits as the fourth-best paid workers in the G7, as British real wages fall back to their 2006 levels; the weekly food shop will cost the average household around £100, more than twice as much as it cost at the start of the century; the total number of divorces will spike by one-fifth to almost 140,000 in England and Wales, equivalent to 16 divorces every hour; and . . . it’s coming home! The England Women’s team will succeed where the men failed and bring home the World Cup in the summer of 2023. Warwick Lightfoot: Advanced economies including the UK have to learn again how to use monetary and fiscal policy as tools of macroeconomic demand management and co-ordinate them in a coherent manner. The UK’s central bank has to demonstrate the institutional will power to deliver on its inflation target, and the Treasury needs to review the inflation target, the role of intermediate objectives in supporting it and how the inflation target functions in the context of asset price movements, including movements in the exchange rate. John Llewellyn: The US is likely to experience only a moderate slowdown, being self-sufficient in both food and energy. The EU is less well placed and set for a recession because, while self-sufficient in food, it is not in energy. But the UK is set for the deepest recession in the G7 because, self-sufficient neither in food nor in energy, it is losing further income because of Brexit. Chris Martin: Sorry to be so miserable! Costas Milas: FT readers, and rightly so, will question our forecasts for 2023. Their scepticism is fully justified. We, financial economists, had a tough time over the past 22 years or so. We responded to our failure in forecasting the 2008-09 financial crisis by introducing financial stress measures into economic models. We responded to the Covid pandemic by updating our models with infectious disease trackers. In response to the war in Ukraine, we are now monitoring geopolitical risk measures. That is, we have been flexible enough to revise our models and thinking, but we still have a lot of catching up to do — and credibility to re-establish! — in this fast-evolving economic world. Andrew Mountford: Corruption is a real danger for the long-run productivity and prosperity of the UK economy. One of the most influential academic economic research agendas in recent years has been that of Acemoglu and Robinson on “extractive” versus “inclusive” institutions, summarised in their book Why Nations Fail. They argue that the contrasting levels of productivity and wealth between countries stems from the difference in institutional quality. They illustrate their argument by comparing the paths to success of the richest people in Mexico and the USA (p. 39). The richest man in Mexico, they allege, became ultra-wealthy through government regulated monopolies and political contacts, whereas the success of some of the wealthiest people in the USA stems from technological innovation. One doesn’t have to uncritically accept all aspects of their thesis to be persuaded of the very harmful long-run effects for an economy if success becomes ever more determined by personal contacts and access to lucrative public contracts rather than productive and innovative activity, or in Acemoglu and Robinson’s terminology, if institutions become extractive rather than inclusive. Inclusive institutions protect the public interest, nurture talent and allow effort to be rewarded. Examples include legal institutions and law enforcement that protect property rights, educational and training institutions, financial regulations that enforce financial fair play and tax authorities that ensure large companies pay the same tax as small local companies. These institutions are a vital public good and they require adequate investment. The natural way to fund vital public investment, which underpins the wealth of the entire economy, is by a tax on the wealth of the entire economy. In the UK, this would be most practically achieved by taxing the value of land. Land cannot be moved to evade taxation and its price depends as much on the ability of people to pay for it — ie on the health of the economy, local planning policy and regional investment, as on the actions of the landowner. The ONS estimates the value of land and assets-over-land to be significantly more than £5tn compared to a GDP of a little more than £2tn. Thus a 1 per cent tax would be worth about 2.5 per cent of GDP and so could back substantial spending each year. This would allow for a positive annual public investment flow backed by additions to the stock of public owned assets which can be realised later. John Muellbauer: The UK has returned to the 1970s epithet of being “the sick man of Europe”. The “Thatcher cure” hasn’t worked. The Brexiteers’ goal of making the UK “Singapore-on-Thames” is a delusion based on a profound misunderstanding of Singapore. Andrew J Oswald: Young economists have not lived through times like these. I am afraid we all learn by painful experience. Christopher Pissarides: The election is creating more uncertainties because the government is keeping an eye on the polls and it might shy away from tough policies needed to boost investment. This is another uncertainty that weighs more heavily on the UK than its peers. Vicky Pryce: Looking ahead, I worry about the increasing isolation from Europe and the lack of a proper industrial policy and sufficient funding that could all result in the UK struggling to remain competitive in many areas, including in climate change. And as we learned from the 2008 crisis, putting all our eggs in an increasingly deregulated financial sector to save us is a very risky strategy. Morten O. Ravn: Hopefully, the UK will be able to get its fiscal policy right. The austerity package in the wake of the financial crisis was costly and probably contributed to the UK’s current problems, as was the “Truss experiment”. And one might fear that the Sunak administration’s renewed appetite for austerity will make things worse. This could all have been avoided by better designed policies aimed at improving the credibility and efficiency of the UK fiscal regime. John Van Reenen: The key to long-term recovery is to deal with productivity slowdown. Need a credible Growth Plan (eg: https://cep.lse.ac.uk/LSE-Growth-Commission/files/LSEGC-2012-report.pdf). Need more investment through policy stability and tax reform, decent vocational training and skills system, a closer relationship with the EU and real support for innovation. Ricardo Reis: On the last question business investment at pre-pandemic levels would still be disappointingly low, and not enough to sustain growth. Michael Saunders: The neutral nominal level of interest rates in coming years is likely to be higher than the pre-pandemic period, because of higher inflation expectations and a more volatile inflation climate. Yael Selfin: Poor investment and exports performance remain a major worry for medium-term growth. Andrew Sentance: Political chaos and uncertainty have badly affected UK economic prospects since the Brexit vote. Andrew Simms: In spite of the clearest science and warnings, there is still scant evidence of governments fully understanding and acting on the imperative of the climate and ecological emergency, as if they have failed to understand that this is the frame for all economic policy and that adequate action is non-negotiable. At the launch of its latest report, the IPCC commented that “any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future”. On the same issues, António Guterres, UN secretary-general, using highly unusual, undiplomatic language said: “The abdication of leadership [on climate action] is criminal . . . delay means death . . . now is the time to turn rage into action.”  In words that could have been pointed directly at the UK government, he said: “Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” The latter sentiment has been echoed by Fatih Birol, executive director of the usually conservative International Energy Agency. When Rishi Sunak was embarrassed into attending COP27, he talked of the UK’s climate leadership and boasted of the UK’s climate finance going to Kenya. This overlooked the UK breaking its aid commitments, failing to meet its global contributions and the fact that Kenya already produces more than 80 per cent of its electricity from renewables, with the UK producing only 38 per cent. Other countries ranging from Costa Rica, to Paraguay, Ethiopia, Uruguay, Iceland, Albania and Bhutan produce 100 per cent renewable electricity. Signals matter in politics, and for the UK to regain any credibility it will need to backtrack on fracking, and on issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences.  A better signal would be for the UK government to follow London’s leadership and back a Fossil Fuel Non Proliferation Treaty, endorsed by the EU parliament, other major global cities from Sydney to Kolkata, thousands of scientists and more than 100 Nobel Prize Winners. For the UK to have a future it needs to let go of its fossil fuel past. There are other ways, too, in which we could stop promoting our own self-destruction. We could follow the life-preserving precedent of the ban on tobacco advertising and stop advertising high carbon products and lifestyles, from the fossil fuel companies themselves to gas-guzzling SUVs and flights. At the city level, from Amsterdam and The Hague to Stockholm and cities such as Norwich and Liverpool in the UK, policies are being passed to end such “badverts” in the public domain. Change is easier when you are not surrounded by adverts to stay the same. Andrew Smithers: More tangible investment is essential to raise trend growth to a significant positive rate. This can be done by cutting corporation tax and increasing the credit for tangible investment, provided that the credit does not take the form of accelerated depreciation. Unfortunately, there is no sign that this is understood by the government, the opposition or the press including, I regret to write, the FT. Kitty Ussher: Many of these questions are false choices. The workforce is likely to grow through migration and population growth, not necessarily due to dropouts returning, although there may be a slight dropout reversal effect. Pre-pandemic levels of business investment were low because of Brexit uncertainty. Business investment may well be higher than official forecasts but that would be because the worst of the inflationary peak and equity market fall is perceived to be behind us, leading to a more risk-embracing sentiment in the markets, regardless of Brexit. Martin Weale: Wage increases are likely to stay higher than the BoE assumes and CPI inflation will probably also prove more persistent. Michael Wickens: 1) Welfare benefits from low inflation and high growth. Currently, we have high inflation and low growth. 2) Monetary policy has been too loose and fiscal policy is too tight. 3) The MPC requires members who are experts in monetary policy, as they were when the MPC was first set up and monetary policy was successful. The Treasury evidently disagrees. The BoE’s mistakes are therefore not a complete surprise. Trevor Williams: The UK will perform the worst of the G7 economies this year, dragged down by a lack of investment, public and private, and weak employment growth, meaning poor productivity.","02.01.2023"
