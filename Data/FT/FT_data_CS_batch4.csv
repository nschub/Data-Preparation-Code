"Credit Suisse: watching the detectives","Controversy raises questions about leadership at the listed Swiss bank","A row at a party, a breakdown in professional relationships and a confrontation with private detectives. Reports of clashes between Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse’s chief executive and his erstwhile colleague Iqbal Khan have created lurid headlines in Switzerland. The controversy raises questions about leadership at the listed Swiss bank. Credit Suisse disputes the veracity of some allegations. The damage to its credibility may still be serious. Swiss bankers rely on their reputation for professionalism. They have long stopped facilitating tax evasion. These days, wealthy clients pay for discretion and trustworthiness. The promise of superior returns is an added lure.  Since Mr Thiam became chief executive in July 2015, the returns on Credit Suisse’s own shares have been underwhelming. They have fallen 44 per cent. But this is partly because he unearthed old problems  Relative to tangible book value, Credit Suisse stock trades at a respectable 0.7 times.  A smart, determined ex-insurance boss, Mr Thiam has successfully tilted Credit Suisse towards managing the wealth of the world’s richest, downsizing its investment bank. He appointed Mr Khan as head of international wealth management, which generated pre-tax income of SFr444m on revenues of SFr1.4bn in the second quarter. The row suggests boundaries between professional and personal became unhelpfully blurred. CEOs have to keep smart subordinates hungry while managing their expectations. Mr Khan was once tipped as a successor to Mr Thiam, who has, however, shown no signs of leaving. Mr Khan’s own departure from Credit Suisse was announced in July. His exit now looks inelegant, to say the least. Credit Suisse’s chairman Urs Rohner has launched an investigation. The resulting report should avoid excuses. The bare facts and the conclusions should be published. If there are flaws in the culture of the bank, this is an opportunity to remedy them. Mr Khan has since taken a top role at rival UBS. It, too, needs to scrutinise standards of conduct. If acceptable bounds of behaviour have been overstepped, no executive merits special protection. ","26.09.2019"
"Holiday season warning cools retail stocks","Credit Suisse lowers sales, earnings forecasts for group of US retailers","The holiday season may not be so jolly for some retailers and fashion brands, which could fall victim to a new wave of store closures if holiday sales disappoint. That is the stark warning from analysts at Credit Suisse who said declining foot traffic at malls and fewer days to shop between Black Friday and Christmas this year will contribute to a “tougher road ahead”. Already, 2019 is on track to be the worst year for US store closures in the 24-year history of the Credit Suisse index that tracks them. Analysts at the bank have lowered their sales and earnings forecasts for a group of US retail companies including Macy’s and Kohl’s, saying Wall Street’s expectations are too optimistic heading into 2020. The bank’s view Friday weighed on the retail sector, whose outlook has already been clouded by US-China tariffs and slower economic growth globally. “We expect sluggish 3Q [same-store sales] & high promotional levels to continue into 4Q, with a shorter holiday shopping period (six fewer days between Black Friday & Christmas), tough weather compares (lapping favourable colder weather trends that extended through much of 4Q18), and ongoing macro uncertainty (tariffs, tourism),” Credit Suisse’s analysts led by Michael Binetti wrote in a note to clients. L Brands was the worst performer in the S&P 500 on Friday, falling more than 7 per cent after Credit Suisse downgraded the Victoria’s Secret owner along with Macy’s and Gap to “underperform” from “neutral” and cut their respective price targets. Gap and Macy’s were both down more than 3 per cent. Credit Suisse also lowered estimates for Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JCPenney. Shares in Ralph Lauren, Hanesbrands and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH fell, as the bank noted their exposure to department stores. “If better holiday 2019 trends don’t materialise, we think it’s going to be increasingly tough for Softlines retailers to avoid even bigger closures in 2020,” Credit Suisse noted. “In fact, our real estate contacts are bracing for another round of large scale store closure announcements after the holiday.” Consumer spending has been a bright spot in the US economy, though in September, domestic retail sales posted their largest monthly decline since February.  The Federal Reserve has pointed to the strength of the consumer, but — as it cut interest rates last month — noted this could be jeopardised by fallout from the trade war, a no-deal Brexit and rising geopolitical tensions in Hong Kong and the Middle East. “[I]n the wake of this increase in downside risk, the weakness in business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring, a development that would likely weigh on consumption and the overall economic outlook,” the minutes of the US central bank’s September meeting revealed. US holiday sales are seen rising between 3.8 per cent and 4.2 per cent this year versus 2018, despite uncertainty around trade, interest rates and politics, according to the National Retail Federation. Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the NRF, said “the pullback in September compared with August is possibly a reaction to increased fears over US-China tensions”.  A series of seasonal factors, such as an early end to the back-to-school shopping period, make September a tough month to measure, Mr Kleinhenz said, adding that “consumers still have a lot going for them.” VF Corp, Ross Stores, Burlington and Nike have made Credit Suisse’s nice list, with analysts identifying the stocks as top picks amid volatility in the industry.","18.10.2019"
"Credit Suisse scandal shakes Zurich’s elite","Rarefied world of Swiss banking left stunned by tale of corporate espionage at country’s ‘crown jewel’","At the opening gala of the Zurich Film Festival a week ago, over champagne served to the city’s social elite, the small talk centred not on the dramas of the big screen but a much more local affair: the corporate spying tale at Credit Suisse.  It was just a short distance from the festival’s venue on Bellevueplatz, that, days earlier, Iqbal Khan, a young, unashamedly ambitious former executive at the bank, had spotted a man trailing him.  The confrontation that followed on a quiet, manicured street just behind the polished facades of the Bahnhofstrasse set in motion two of the most tumultuous weeks of the past decade in Swiss finance. Mr Khan’s shadow, it emerged, was an agent hired by Credit Suisse.  It has been an intangible crisis: no clients have lost capital; no money has been laundered; no assets have been riskily rehypothecated.  But what should have been a mere embarrassment for Switzerland’s second-largest — and arguably most revered — bank has ended up as something far more significant thanks to the particular strains in the insular, but still globally powerful, world of Zurich’s great counting houses that it has laid bare.  “The past few years have been a tense time in Swiss banking,” said James Breiding, founder of Naissance Capital, an investment boutique, and author of the book Swiss Made. A global crackdown on tax havens and the great shift in economic gravity towards Asia had hit Swiss banking hard, noted Mr Breiding, leaving institutions such as Credit Suisse struggling to define what makes them unique.  It is more than a matter of corporate branding. “Credit Suisse has historically had a halo in Switzerland, it was the bastion of the Zurich establishment, founded by a very famous Swiss entrepreneur, Alfred Escher,” Mr Breiding said. “The Swiss are not big on heroes but if you go to the main train station in Zurich, there’s a big statue of him.”  Mr Khan, 43, spectacularly fell out with chief executive Tidjane Thiam, 57, in a professional dispute, driven by ambition, ego and insecurity, that spilled into their private lives. Mr Khan quit in June and, shortly after, announced his pending appointment at Credit Suisse’s great rival, UBS. Credit Suisse, fearful that the young rainmaker would take clients and colleagues with him, ordered his surveillance. In the furore which followed that chain of events becoming public, the contractor who acted as a middle man between Credit Suisse and a private investigation firm took his own life.  For many outside of Switzerland, including Credit Suisse’s most powerful shareholders, the crisis has bordered on the absurd.  “Most people outside of this little European centricity don’t really care or have a strong opinion on this,” said David Herro, vice-chairman of Harris Associates. “This is ground-zero Zurich with some echoes in Europe. But we have got to put this into perspective.” The Chicago-based Mr Herro was forced to fly into Zurich to hold crisis talks with Credit Suisse’s board and emphasise his backing for Mr Thiam.  Yet it is in the lurid — if trivial — detail that the key to the real outrage in Switzerland lies. If the historic essence of Swiss banking was professional discretion and restraint, married to the promise of holding others’ privacy as sacrosanct, then it is hard to think of a scandal more carefully calibrated to upset: a tale of ambition and ego, unseemly public feuding, and potentially unlawful intrusive surveillance.  “You could say of course that Credit Suisse has been guilty of far worse things,” said Mark Pieth, professor of governance at the Basel university. “But Switzerland is a very weird place. We like to consider Credit Suisse as our crown jewel and we say ‘that means you have to behave please’. But what that means really is behave here, not necessarily abroad. Given what happened, I am astonished there has not been more of a stink.”  Much of the public anger, Mr Pieth notes, is about Mr Thiam and what he is perceived to represent.  Since he was hired in 2015, Mr Thiam’s bold strategy to shake up Credit Suisse has impressed many bankers elsewhere in the world but it has been seen in Switzerland, and in Zurich, as an outsider trying to dismantle much of what gave the bank its distinctive character.  Racism was also a factor, said Mr Pieth. Brady Dougan, Mr Thiam’s predecessor, did not live in Switzerland and spoke none of the country’s official languages (Mr Thiam, an Ivorian, speaks French), yet was never so pointedly criticised for being an outsider.  Besides the weight of history, there were other reasons for an air of subversion at the Zurich Film festival. Credit Suisse is the main sponsor of the event. Former model Nadja Schildknecht, the festival’s creator and host, is the partner of chairman, Urs Rohner. Mr Khan, thanks to his role at Credit Suisse as the bank’s chief sherpa to the ultra-wealthy, was well-known to almost everyone from the banking world there.  “It was pretty clear from that evening that this whole scandal has become a real cross-society story, not just a financial one,” said one prominent guest — a former banker and now powerful Swiss businessman.  “And for the Swiss, it won’t go away I don’t think. This sentiment about the bank and its leadership is here to stay. It has triggered too many issues.”","06.10.2019"
"The feud at Credit Suisse that has shaken Swiss banking","Car chases and rows over cocktails: the fallout threatens CEO Tidjane Thiam","The staid world of Swiss banking has been rocked by lurid details of the breakdown in the relationship between Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam and Iqbal Khan, who ran the bank’s wealth management division. Swiss prosecutors are investigating an alleged physical confrontation last week between Mr Khan and up to three men hired by Credit Suisse to follow him after he resigned in July to move to arch-rival UBS. While Credit Suisse has admitted it hired the spy firm, Investigo, each side disputes the other’s version of events. Mr Khan alleges a group of three men chased him and his wife through the streets of Zurich by car and on foot, which culminated in a physical confrontation behind the Swiss National Bank.  However, an Investigo detective has provided a sworn statement to Credit Suisse and authorities that he was alone, rather than in a group of three, and that Mr Khan chased him, rather than the other way around. Investigo was asked to follow Mr Khan only on weekdays from a suitable distance and identify any people he met, according to documents seen by the FT. The controversy has shown no signs of ending. It has raised new questions about longstanding personal animosity between Mr Thiam and Mr Khan — and whether the bank acted appropriately in hiring investigators. “The board is coming under pressure to sort this out and the regulator too,” one major investor told the FT. “It's something of extreme gravity; in Zurich it is becoming a time bomb and you can feel the panic. Both sides have been damaged, but especially Credit Suisse.”   “We have said to the chairman and board they have to provide a clear outcome and explanation; whoever did wrong has to pay,” he said. Mr Khan, who was born in Pakistan and immigrated to Switzerland aged 12, joined Credit Suisse in 2013 after a 12-year career as an auditor at EY. During his tenure, profit at the international wealth management unit increased by around 80 per cent. He helped bring in more than $46bn of net new assets between 2016 and 2018. French-Ivorian Mr Thiam, 57, joined Credit Suisse in March 2015 after running UK insurer Prudential for six years. He quickly set about shrinking the trading arm of the investment bank and repositioning the organisation as a wealth manager focused on ultra-rich entrepreneurs.  Whilst earning plaudits for establishing Credit Suisse as one of the top private banks in Asia, reducing the volatility of earnings and avoiding major scandals — until now — the share price has dropped more than 40 per cent under his leadership. At first, the pair worked well together, according to people familiar with their relationship. Mr Khan was repeatedly promoted and called a “star” by Mr Thiam. But over time, Mr Khan grew frustrated with his profile within the bank, lack of public appearances, and assurances about his potential to rise to lead the organisation. Urs Rohner, chairman of Credit Suisse   Personal animosity grew when Mr Khan bought, knocked down and redeveloped the house immediately next to his boss in the Herrliberg area on the north-eastern “gold coast” of Lake Zurich. The construction work lasted for almost two years, including over some weekends, leading to Mr Thiam making a complaint to Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner about his subordinate, said one person familiar with the situation. Mr Khan insisted the property he bought had been in his wife’s family for years and he had done nothing wrong.  After Mr Khan moved into the newly renovated house, which shares a fence with Mr Thiam’s, the CEO hosted a cocktail party in January for colleagues, people from the neighbourhood and some friends. Mr Khan and his wife attended. At the party, Mr Khan fell out with Mr Thiam’s partner over a dispute about some trees planted on the Thiam property.  Mr Thiam took Mr Khan aside and there was a confrontation away from the other guests, where the CEO complained about the conversation with his girlfriend. Mr Khan claims his wife had to separate them, Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger has reported. Mr Khan later complained to his board and chairman about the incident. After the falling-out in January the two were barely on speaking terms at work, creating a toxic environment at the bank’s headquarters, several people who experienced it said. As a result of the breakdown, Mr Khan was permitted to leave with a shorter than usual gardening leave period of three months before his move to UBS, scheduled next week on October 1, one of the people said. The Swiss National Bank Building in Zurich  At least in public, even after the resignation, Mr Thiam and Mr Khan put on a friendly front. Mr Khan was invited back to Credit Suisse for a photo opportunity and received a standing ovation from staff, several people present said. The same week he also visited UBS to be introduced to his new fellow executives, but was kept in public areas to avoid controversy, according to a person familiar with the situation. Yet Credit Suisse was worried that Mr Khan might try to take key staff members with him, according to people familiar with the matter. As he plotted his exit from Credit Suisse, Mr Khan informally met or was interviewed by several international and Swiss banks in the spring and early summer, including UBS, Julius Baer, Lombard Odier and Goldman Sachs, they said. In some of these conversations, he discussed recruiting some of the top people from Credit Suisse across different bank functions such as structured trading, lending and top-performing relationship managers, they added. Mr Khan told prospective employers his success at Credit Suisse was a team achievement and he would want approval to bring across some of his people if he were to join. There is no suggestion Mr Khan breached the terms of his Credit Suisse employment agreement during these discussions.  Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner has ordered the independent review of the decision to tail Mr Khan, determining which executives signed off on it and if it was justified. The report will be completed in a matter of days and top jobs, including that of Mr Thiam, could be at risk, according to two people with knowledge of the probe. “Someone’s job will go, or at least there will be an appropriate sanction,” one of the people said.  Pierre-Olivier Bouée, Credit Suisse’s chief operating officer and Mr Thiam’s closest confidant, also acts as the bank’s head of security and signed the contract with the external firm Investigo, they said. Mr Bouée declined to comment through a spokesman. UBS has also been forced to address the controversy. Chairman Axel Weber said in a television interview the bank had been running due diligence checks on Mr Khan as recently as today, an unusual admission considering he is supposed to start in less than a week. “Everything needs to be by the book,” he told Bloomberg TV. “If things don’t happen by the book I’m not in favour of doing it.” Credit Suisse declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr Khan declined to comment. Additional reporting by Sam Jones in Vienna

"Credit Suisse disputes allegations about private investigator","Departing executive Iqbal Khan claims he was chased by three men through streets of Zurich","Credit Suisse has challenged a departing executive’s account of a confrontation with private investigators hired by the bank, disputing allegations that are being examined by Swiss prosectors. Iqbal Khan — who ran Credit Suisse’s wealth management business before abruptly resigning in July to move to crosstown rival UBS — raised a case with Zurich’s cantonal prosecutor last week accusing a group of three men of chasing him and his wife through the streets of the city by car and on foot. This culminated in a physical confrontation behind the Swiss National Bank where the men tried to snatch his mobile phone as he was taking pictures of them and their car, Swiss newspapers reported over the weekend. However, the detective, who the Financial Times on Monday revealed works for a Swiss company called Investigo, has provided a sworn statement to Credit Suisse and authorities that he was alone, rather than in a group of three, and that Mr Khan chased him, rather than the other way around, according to a copy of the document seen by the FT. The private eye said he had instructions from the bank to follow Mr Khan only on weekdays from a suitable distance and identify any people he met with, avoiding breaking any criminal or traffic laws, the document reads. When confronted by Mr Khan after parking his car, the Investigo employee said he raised his hands to block the phone and asked not to be photographed before leaving with Mr Khan in pursuit. The alternative version of last week’s events is the latest development in a saga which illustrates the intense competition for staff and clients among Zurich’s tight-knit private banking community. Mr Khan’s sudden exit from Credit Suisse this summer followed tensions with his chief executive Tidjane Thiam over his profile and future, the FT reported at the time. The surveillance was ordered as Credit Suisse suspected he was tapping up colleagues and clients to join him at UBS, where he will start as co-head of wealth management on October 1. Credit Suisse’s board on Monday said it had ordered external consultants and lawyers to conduct an inquiry into the decision to hire private investigators, determining which executives signed off on it and if it was justified. The bank also put out an internal memo to staff saying there were “significant inaccuracies” in media reports that “sensationalised both facts and events” and it was “confident that the truth will emerge”. The email was signed by Mr Thiam and chairman Urs Rohner. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the latest developments, as did a representative for Mr Khan. A spokesman for Investigo did not respond to emails or telephone calls seeking comment. An official at the Zurich public prosecutor’s office on Monday confirmed it had opened a criminal case for coercion and threat, declining to provide any further details. Zurich police made three arrests in connection with the case.","24.09.2019"
"Spying scandal weighs on Tidjane Thiam’s tenure at Credit Suisse","The share price has halved and reputations are at stake amid intrigue in Zurich","When Tidjane Thiam arrived at the helm of Credit Suisse in the summer of 2015, he was a hero. Plucked from the same role at UK insurer Prudential, where he had doubled the share price in six years, he had big plans to shrink the Swiss group’s investment bank, slash costs, raise fresh capital and expand in Asia. He was one of four high-flying financiers parachuted in to run four of Europe’s biggest banks over a period of seven months in 2015 — alongside Bill Winters, who joined Standard Chartered; Jes Staley, who took over at Barclays; and John Cryan, who became Deutsche Bank chief executive. Four-and-a-bit years on, and with some bumps along the way, Mr Thiam’s strategy has been implemented. Yet the CS share price has halved. Other than the performance of Deutsche, from which Mr Cryan was ejected last year, that is the worst record of “the class of 2015”. Now his reputation has been further hurt by a bizarre tale of personal intrigue. Can he survive? Mr Thiam’s clash with Iqbal Khan, who has left CS for crosstown rival, UBS, peaked last month when Mr Khan was tailed by CS-appointed private detectives, suspicious he was plotting to hire former colleagues. A one-time close relationship had degenerated after the men, who lived next door to each other in Zurich, clashed over the disruption caused by Mr Khan’s building work and his reported keenness to be anointed as Mr Thiam’s successor. The affair had the hallmarks of a hapless soap opera, but darkened when the security contractor who had employed the detective committed suicide. Trying to draw a line under the episode, CS’s head of security and Pierre-Olivier Bouée, Mr Thiam’s career-long right-hand man, left the bank. The Swiss media has followed every twist of the saga with Schadenfreude, culminating in a damning editorial in dominant local newspaper NZZ last weekend, which accused Mr Thiam of bringing the Swiss financial sector into disrepute. When Mr Thiam’s American predecessor Brady Dougan was ousted, it followed a fallout with the Swiss media over a SFr70m bonus, as well as unheeded pressure from the Swiss regulator to raise capital. That translated, via a Swiss-dominated board and some big Swiss shareholders, into Mr Dougan’s exit. But the Iqbal Khan affair has pitched the Swiss establishment against the foreigners. Mr Thiam — a rare black foreigner in Swiss finance — heads a bank whose dominant shareholders these days (the state-backed Qatar Investment Authority, US fund Harris Associates, Saudi fund Olayan, Norway’s Norges and BlackRock) are also based overseas. So far those investors have been supportive, despite the fact that the latest farce has compounded the share price decline. The stock is down 6 per cent since the affair broke. Board members — also now mainly non-Swiss — are convinced the media backlash is motivated in part by racist and xenophobic views. As long as there is no evidence to suggest Mr Thiam’s involvement in the hiring of the private detectives — and an internal probe concluded there was none — they and top investors will remain supportive. The CEO must take responsibility to save the reputation of the bank . . . It would make sense to install a Swiss national as CEOFormer CS chief executive Oswald Grübe There has been plenty of sniping from the sidelines, though. In an interview with the Sunday edition of the NZZ, former CS chief executive Oswald Grübel was damning, saying CS and Mr Thiam looked “ridiculous” and “embarrassing”. One big question must be whether the reputational damage from the affair has any impact on business, particularly in CS’s home market. Calling obliquely for Mr Thiam to be ejected, Mr Grübel said his own resignation as UBS boss amid the Kweku Adoboli rogue trading scandal showed “the CEO must take responsibility to save the reputation of the bank . . . It would make sense to install a Swiss national as CEO.” It is notable that the Swiss national who chairs the bank, Urs Rohner, has largely escaped criticism. This, despite the fact that he was the person who oversaw the unusually short terms of departure for Mr Khan, according to bank insiders. It was that expedited departure that in turn sparked concerns he might poach staff to take to UBS, prompting the hiring of the detectives. Mr Thiam and Mr Rohner, who hired him as chief executive and has said a chairman has only one shot at appointing the right CEO, have so far been closely aligned. The pair seem likely to withstand the latest farrago, too. But the margin for error from here on looks pretty thin. patrick.jenkins@ft.com

"Credit Suisse’s potential damages mount in RMBS cases","Swiss bank is one of last to fight lawsuits over crisis-era mortgage-backed securities","Credit Suisse’s decision to fight lawsuits over financial crisis-era residential mortgage-backed securities has seen its potential damages almost double, long after most of its main rivals settled their cases. Even after signing a $5.3bn RMBS settlement with the US Department of Justice in 2017, the Swiss bank faces at least a dozen investor lawsuits over mortgage debt the bank securitised and which plummeted in value during the 2008-09 crisis. An appellate court last month ruled in favour of the bank’s challengers, allowing some of the cases to proceed to trial.  The Swiss bank held $681m in litigation reserves at the end of 2018. Regulatory filings by the bank say it is facing damages in lawsuits that could exceed its reserves by up to $1.4bn. One case is scheduled to go to trial in January at the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan. The plaintiffs are three trusts that issued securities backed by 23,900 mortgage loans purchased from a Credit Suisse subsidiary. The trusts claim the bank misrepresented the quality of the mortgage loans by misstating the borrowers’ income, employment and debt levels. Among the securities owners standing behind the trusts are hedge funds, including Fir Tree, which bought the distressed securities following the crisis. The amount of damages the claimants are seeking — $730m — has roughly doubled since the case was filed because of the 9 per cent annual interest they accrue.  It is easier to settle cases when there are a fair number of precedents that are on point and enough settlements to establish the settlement range. Here there areJohn Coffee, Columbia Law School professor A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the bank “categorically rejects any suggestion that it defrauded any investors in RMBS”.  “Our due diligence and investor risk disclosures met or exceeded RMBS industry standards,” she added. Investors losses “were not a result of Credit Suisse misconduct, but rather due to the decline in the housing market and the broader economic downturn”. Credit Suisse has a reputation among New York trial attorneys as one of the banks most willing to drag out litigation. One lawyer said the bank was likely to be doing so to avoid becoming a target for frivolous lawsuits. “It’s the scenario they’ve built for themselves,” the lawyer said. “After deciding not to settle early on, they get to the point where it becomes more worthwhile to fight for the sake of fighting. They’ve doubled down on their gamble . . . they figure, let’s just play it out and maybe we’ll get something good from the court.” “Their strategy, I don’t think, has worked for them,” the lawyer added.  While Credit Suisse’s US regulatory filings disclose at least 12 open RMBS court actions with investors, the mortgage insurer MBIA, the New Jersey attorney-general and the receivers of several failed banks, other big banks’ reports reflect a less aggressive approach.  Bank of America, which was heavily involved in RMBS issuance before the crisis, does not list any open RMBS actions in its annual filings, and neither does JPMorgan Chase. Citigroup, another major RMBS backer, lists just four open actions, several in the final stages.  Credit Suisse is awaiting a verdict in another RMBS case that went to trial in July in Manhattan, filed by MBIA, which insured the securities. MBIA also claims the Swiss bank defrauded them by lying about the quality of the loans.  The bank’s hardball tactics may have helped it in at least one case. In 2012 then New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman sought $11bn from the bank, again over claims it misrepresented the quality of mortgages. An appellate court ruling limited the scope of the case, and it was settled in January for $10m. John Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor and securities litigation expert, said: “It is easier to settle cases when there are a fair number of precedents that are on point and enough settlements to establish the settlement range. Here there are.” The current RMBS suits are also the last vestiges of a lucrative hedge fund trade. Funds snapped up the securities for cents on the dollar in 2009 and 2010 as the banks and other holders desperately tried to unload them. In some cases, the securities regained their value after homeowners began making payments on their mortgages again. In other cases, hedge funds turned to the courts to press the banks for settlements.  “Most of these defendants have seen the writing on the wall, and a large number have settled,” said John Libra, a lawyer at the law firm Korein Tillery with experience in RMBS litigation. He said he thought the bank might be holding out for favourable court decisions.","07.10.2019"
"Credit Suisse: Tidjane Thiam weathers the storm","Investors are split on the outcome of the bank’s probe into a spying scandal","Residents of a wealthy suburb on the “gold coast” of Lake Zurich were rudely awakened on Wednesday morning, when a huge crane mounted on a six-wheeled truck started unloading building blocks. The delivery went to the house of Iqbal Khan, until recently the head of wealth management at Credit Suisse.  Among the neighbours whose cars were blocked by the crane happened to be Tidjane Thiam, chief executive at the same Swiss bank, who was trying to get to the airport. It was only the latest source of tension between the two men in a feud that has gripped Switzerland.  On September 20, it emerged that Credit Suisse had hired a private investigator to follow Mr Khan, who was defecting to the bank’s arch-rival UBS. Mr Khan spotted his stalkers and tried to lose them during a car chase, before confronting them on the street. The affair took a darker turn days later when a security contractor who employed the investigator on the bank’s behalf died by suicide. Two Credit Suisse employees have lost their jobs: Mr Thiam’s closest confidant, Pierre-Olivier Bouée, the chief operating officer; and Remo Boccali, the bank’s head of security. Meanwhile, Mr Khan started work at rival UBS on Tuesday.  The Financial Times has spoken to 10 people close to the acrimonious relationship to chronicle a dispute that had tragic consequences, damaged Credit Suisse’s reputation and made headlines around the world. Both men and both banks declined to comment. Shareholders didn’t want Tidjane to go, but someone had to pay for the messTop-20 shareholder Mr Khan, a former consultant at EY, rose quickly through the ranks at Credit Suisse after joining in 2013. Two years later, he was entrusted to run the international wealth management unit, which Mr Thiam had made the cornerstone of his turnround strategy. Mr Khan delivered. During his tenure, profit at the unit increased about 80 per cent and he helped bring in more than $46bn of net new assets between 2016 and 2018. In happier times, Mr Thiam referred to him as “a star”. But soon the brash and ambitious Mr Khan felt increasingly under-appreciated, frustrated by his profile within the bank, his lack of public appearances and scant assurances about his potential to succeed Mr Thiam. He also lobbied unsuccessfully for more capital to be allocated to his unit and suggested that Asia wealth management — a cash cow that sat in a different division — should be added to his empire.  At home, the relationship between the two men was unravelling. Their animosity stemmed in large part from their neighbourhood dispute, which began after the junior executive moved in to the house next door and started renovating it. The pair quarrelled over Mr Khan’s lengthy construction project and obtrusive trees in Mr Thiam’s garden. In early January, against the tense backdrop of more than two years of noisy construction work, things almost came to blows at a neighbourhood cocktail party hosted by Mr Thiam. Mr Khan had an argument with Mr Thiam’s partner about two tall pine trees she said were planted to protect their privacy from new windows he had installed. Mr Khan claimed they blocked his view of the lake. Mr Thiam asked to speak to Mr Khan in private and threatened to “take him outside” unless he apologised. The men had to be separated. “[It] seemed to have been a heated discussion. Their accounts differed,” Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner said at a press conference earlier this week, adding that he had hoped the pair would be able to put their differences aside and continue working together.  “However, with time it became evident a long-term collaboration was not possible and . . . Mr Khan wanted to leave,” he said. In February, Mr Khan felt passed over in an internal reorganisation and became progressively more withdrawn and taciturn at work. In meetings, he would participate little, instead leaning back on his chair and folding his arms, according to people in attendance. “He would just sort of sulk, to the point where we would ask him what was the matter,” one executive recalled. During Iqbal Khan's tenure, profit at the international wealth management unit increased about 80 per cent © Reuters Mr Khan finally quit on July 1. In the statement announcing his departure, Mr Thiam pointedly stressed he was responsible for the rapid rise of his junior: “I identified Iqbal Khan as a great candidate for the job.” Mr Khan negotiated an unusually favourable exit package. He was only required to give a three-month notice period compared with the usual six months — plus a stint of gardening leave lasting up to a year — designed to reduce the risk of leavers poaching colleagues and clients. The cocktail party confrontation led to the special dispensation. This week, Mr Rohner admitted he “helped broker a mutually beneficial termination agreement with Mr Khan” to try to smooth things over. Mr Khan had for months been quietly meeting with rivals including Julius Baer and UBS and it had got back to Credit Suisse that he had discussed a “wish list” of co-workers he wanted to eventually recruit. By the time Mr Khan returned from a family holiday at the end of August he had spurned the chief executive role at Julius Baer and signed with UBS, who unveiled him as a co-head of its $2.5tn wealth management unit. At this point COO Mr Bouée “considered the risk of Mr Khan breaching his contractual obligations had changed from hypothesis to reality and initiated the observation”, according to John Tiner, the Credit Suisse director who oversaw the bank’s investigation of the matter.  Mr Bouée and his head of security, Mr Boccali, hired a security contractor to catch Mr Khan in the act. He, in turn, enlisted a small private investigations company called Investigo to tail the banker. Based in a nondescript industrial estate in Otelfingen 25 minutes from Zurich, Investigo is more skilled at digging out benefit fraudsters, collecting debts and providing personal protection than corporate espionage. An August job advert for the company sought male candidates between the ages of 22 and 50, that were “flexible, sporty and highly reliable” and “physically in good shape”. A rival bank chief executive said it was highly unusual that Credit Suisse had requested private spies to physically tail Mr Khan. Poaching investigations are usually assigned to big-name corporate-intelligence companies such as Kroll, and limited to a trawl of emails and phone records, he said. Investigo’s operatives were clumsy and got caught. On Tuesday, September 17 after dropping his son at football practice, Mr Khan realised he and his wife were being tailed by one or more men in a car. Mr Khan stopped his car outside the Metropole restaurant and noisily confronted the men, before reporting the matter to the police, prompting Zurich’s cantonal prosecutor to start investigating.  Credit Suisse’s board said this is when it found out about the surveillance. Later that week a Swiss blog called Inside ParadePlatz broke the news that police had arrested several people. The bank hired law firm Homburger to conduct an investigation, focusing on Mr Bouée because he signed off on the surveillance. After lurid details became public, Credit Suisse’s biggest investors quickly defended the bank and its chief executive. David Herro, deputy chairman of Harris Associates, the largest shareholder, said: “Unless laws have been broken, [it] doesn’t seem like a case for anyone losing their job.” On Thursday, September 26 he flew to Zurich to support Mr Thiam. Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner (right) admitted he 'helped broker a mutually beneficial termination agreement with Mr Khan' to try to smooth things over © ENNIO LEANZA/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock At 8am last Tuesday, a pallid and exhausted Mr Rohner took to the stage at a hastily-arranged press conference in an auditorium less than half a kilometre away from the site where Mr Khan faced his pursuers. Mr Thiam was exonerated by the probe — comprised of 14 interviews with Credit Suisse staff, Mr Khan and Investigo, and reviews of emails and messages — which found no evidence he was aware of the surveillance.  Similarly, there was no proof that Mr Khan attempted to steal clients or staff while on gardening leave, but “he continued to socialise with certain key employees”, according to the report. Even now, not all investors were as supportive as Mr Herro. One of the bank’s largest shareholders said he was surprised by the lack of further departures, adding the chairman and chief executive still have questions to answer. While Mr Thiam appears to have weathered the immediate storm, the news for Mr Bouée was not so good. The week before, on Tuesday September 24, the third party contractor who hired Investigo was found dead in an apparent suicide.  Before news of the suicide broke, Mr Bouée had hoped to keep his job but his position became untenable after the tragedy was reported in the media, said two people involved. “The suicide played a role, yes,” one person close to Mr Thiam said, referring to Pierre-Olivier Bouée’s by his longstanding nickname, POB. “POB is an unnecessary casualty. To lose him over Iqbal is devastating.” Mr Thiam, 57, a former Côte d'Ivoire government minister, met Mr Bouée at the turn of the century when both were consultants at McKinsey. When Mr Thiam moved to Aviva in 2002 he brought across his friend two years later. Mr Bouée then followed his boss to Prudential in 2008 and Credit Suisse in 2015. A top-20 shareholder described Mr Bouée as the “fall guy”. The investor added: “Shareholders didn’t want Tidjane to go, but someone had to pay for the mess. Tidjane has looked after POB for 20 years and now he’s fallen on his sword.” Things have worked out better for the 43-year-old Mr Khan, who is now a top candidate to be the next UBS chief executive, one of the most powerful positions in global finance and Swiss society. In his first memo to UBS staff, Mr Khan sidestepped the scandal entirely, merely pledging to “unlock . . . unrealised potential”. As part of his deal with Mr Rohner, he left Credit Suisse with a $2m payout and the $4m to $5m of deferred pay he forfeited was picked up by UBS, people familiar with the terms said. He has a major house renovation to pay for.","04.10.2019"
"Credit Suisse board set to back Tidjane Thiam over spying affair","Directors assured by support from top shareholders including Harris Associates","Directors at Credit Suisse are closing ranks around chief executive Tidjane Thiam as the Swiss bank attempts to draw a line under a corporate espionage scandal.  The Zurich-based lender is battling its worst reputational crisis in years after it engaged a private investigator to track its outgoing head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan.  The bank ordered the surveillance because of fears that Mr Khan was preparing to poach bankers and clients to bolster the fortunes of arch rival UBS, where he is due to start in a similar role on Tuesday.  The corporate spying effort descended into farce this month after Mr Khan confronted private investigators who were following him, leading to an angry altercation in downtown Zurich. The unedifying episode has raised questions over the judgment of Mr Thiam, who had an acrimonious relationship with Mr Khan, in part because of a string of neighbourly disputes concerning residences they each own in Zurich.  Credit Suisse’s board is united in its belief that Mr Thiam should remain as chief executive and that the bank was within its rights to try to ascertain whether Mr Khan planned to pick off its bankers and clients, according to two people briefed on their thinking. One of the people cautioned that the board had not yet digested the final version of an inquiry into the events, which is being led by an external law firm and supervised by John Tiner, a director who chairs the bank’s audit committee. A final decision is expected to be made within the next couple of days. The person said the report would probably focus on the culpability of executives beneath Mr Thiam and whether Investigo, the private investigation company, had overstepped its remit. Credit Suisse did not respond to a request for comment. The board’s determination to back Mr Thiam has been bolstered by the support of some large investors, including Chicago-based Harris Associates. Harris is the company’s largest shareholder, with about 8.1 per cent. In an interview with the Financial Times, David Herro, deputy chairman of Harris Associates, said he did not think the bank should fire any executives over the incident. “These are humans; people aren’t flawless,” he said. “They don’t make perfect decisions every time. And this is why, unless laws have been broken, this doesn’t seem like a case for anyone losing their job.” Mr Herro said that depending on the final conclusions of the inquiry, “perhaps . . . some poor judgment was shown in the way to best protect the stakeholders from a departing executive. I think at this point this is the worst that can be said.” He added: “The question becomes whether this whole kerfuffle has an impact on the company. Will it impact a counterparty doing business with Credit Suisse? Will it impact a high net worth person turning funds over to Credit Suisse? I think it’s doubtful. Most people outside of [Zurich] don’t really care or have a strong opinion on this.” Another prominent shareholder agreed that the episode was “not a resigning matter” for Mr Thiam, although they said they expected the bank’s board to try to close the row down this week and stem the flow of lurid headlines. Ricky Sandler, chief executive of Eminence Capital, a New York-based asset manager which owns 2 per cent of the bank’s shares, said he continued to “think highly” of Mr Thiam and his team. “Losing the CEO or any other members of senior management because of this would be a very unfortunate outcome,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr Khan is expected to take up his new job this week as head of UBS’s wealth management business. Some UBS bankers had wondered whether the Swiss group would seek to delay the appointment, after the group’s chairman, Axel Weber, gave an interview in which he said the company was still doing due diligence on its new employee and did not want to make any “regret” hires. “I fully expect him to be at his desk on Tuesday morning,” said one person familiar with his appointment. A UBS spokesperson confirmed that Mr Khan would begin work as planned.","29.09.2019"
"Credit Suisse to review surveillance ordered on star who defected","Executive joining UBS has raised case with authorities saying he had been followed","Credit Suisse’s board has launched an inquiry into the bank’s decision to hire private investigators to follow a high-flying executive who defected to arch-rival UBS.  Iqbal Khan, who ran Credit Suisse’s wealth management business before abruptly announcing his departure in July, has raised a case with Zurich’s cantonal prosecutor, which is investigating the legality of his employer’s actions. Three men followed Mr Khan, 43, and his wife, through the streets of the city last Wednesday, culminating in a chase and a confrontation outside a restaurant behind the Swiss National Bank, German and Swiss newspapers reported this weekend.  Mr Khan noticed a car closely tailing him and taking photos after he and his wife had dropped their six-year-old child at football practice. He attempted to evade it, resulting in a chase that ended in the city centre, according to people familiar with the matter.  When he could not shake off the men pursuing him, a verbal confrontation occurred, with Mr Khan exiting the car shouting “police, police” and attempting to take pictures of the car’s number plate, the people said.  The private detectives tailing Mr Khan work for Investigo, an “investigations and security solutions” company based in Otelfingen in the country, according to another person with knowledge of the details.  Investigo did not respond to emails or telephone calls to the details listed on its cached website and the live webpage was listed as “under construction” on Monday. The surveillance was ordered as Credit Suisse suspected he was tapping up colleagues and clients to join him at UBS, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.  An official at the Zurich public prosecutor’s office said it had “opened a criminal case for coercion and threat”. “We cannot provide further information because of the ongoing procedure.” Three arrests have been made by Zurich police. In an internal memo sent to Credit Suisse staff today, a copy of which was seen by the FT, the bank said that there had been “significant inaccuracies” in the reports of events that had emerged over the weekend. The short memo gave no details as to what elements of the incident the bank disputes.  “A detailed inquiry has been launched by the board of directors into these events and we are confident that the truth will emerge,” according to the memo signed by chief executive Tidjane Thiam and chairman Urs Rohner.  The probe will be carried out by external consultants and lawyers and will determine which executives signed off on the surveillance and if any laws were broken, a person familiar with the process said. A spokesperson for Mr Khan declined to comment. Credit Suisse declined to comment.  Mr Khan’s sudden exit from Credit Suisse in July followed tensions with Mr Thiam over his profile and future, the Financial Times reported at the time. He was close to joining Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer as chief executive, but decided to join UBS at the last minute, according to two people familiar with the situation. Last month he was named by UBS as the new co-head of its core wealth management unit, making him one of the leading internal contenders to succeed the bank’s chief executive Sergio Ermotti, now in his eighth year in charge. Mr Khan is due to start in the role on October 1 and at present remains an employee of Credit Suisse. Details of the incident first emerged on Friday, through the blog Inside Parade Platz, which reports on gossip from the insular, elite world of Swiss banking.   ","23.09.2019"
"Iqbal Khan, a bold banker who took on his boss","The man regarded as the heir apparent at Credit Suisse has been embroiled in a lurid feud","It takes a certain kind of person to move in next door to their boss. Today the biggest question in Swiss banking is just what kind of person Iqbal Khan is.  Three months ago, Mr Khan, whose rapid ascent at Credit Suisse had marked him out to many as the heir apparent to chief executive Tidjane Thiam, quit his senior position at the bank. This week, details emerged of a bitter row between Mr Khan, 43, and Mr Thiam, 57, triggered by a confrontation in central Zurich between the private banking prodigy and detectives Credit Suisse had hired to monitor him after he resigned.  It was a lurid end to a spectacular dispute between two of the most powerful men in finance — one from which Mr Khan may yet emerge triumphant. On Tuesday, he is due to take up a senior position at UBS, which would make him a likely successor to Sergio Ermotti as the bank’s chief executive. Mr Ermotti is known to admire Mr Khan’s relentless ambition, prizing it over the qualities of other more rounded contemporaries. Meanwhile, UBS’s chairman, Axel Weber, has taken a dimmer view of the spectacle, according to a person who knows him.  Bruising rows between big egos are not new in the world of finance. But the suburban dimension to Mr Khan’s collision with his boss has given it a distinctive flavour. After he boldly moved into the house next door to Mr Thiam’s two years ago, the pair channelled a simmering generational workplace conflict into bickering over house improvements and blocked views. The dispute climaxed in a row at a neighbourhood cocktail party in January. “To me, moving in next door like that, there are two signals you might be wanting to send,” says one Credit Suisse executive. “Either: ‘We get along so well I’d like to spend more time near you,’ or else: ‘I’m coming for you.’”  Yet the image of an overweening princeling is only part of the picture. Many of those who have worked with Mr Khan recognise different sides to his personality. 
 “He’s the kind of guy who will treat a waiter just the same as he would a chief executive,” says Dan Zilberman, head of Europe at Warburg Pincus, who has worked with Mr Khan for the past six years. “He treats everyone with respect. He’s good with people. He’s honest and he’s humble.”  With neat spectacles, sharply parted hair and a taste for discreet but heavyweight timepieces by the luxury Swiss watchmaker IWC, Mr Khan always cut a smooth figure at gatherings in Zurich. But it was his solicitous interest in others, and memory for small personal details, that marked him out on the social circuit from other hard-driving titans of high finance.  Former colleagues say it isn’t an act. He is driven by results, rather than show, several of those who have worked with him have said. He is not brash. Until his fateful move next door to Mr Thiam, he occupied a terraced house in the low-tax but also low-key canton of Schwyz. On one of his first trips to hire a new team for Credit Suisse, he flew economy class to South America. Mr Khan’s first boss at Credit Suisse, Hans-Ulrich Meister, would regularly tell colleagues and clients that he was the best hire he ever made. “He was very eloquent,” recalls one colleague
. “He has this rare mix of being both analytical and details-driven, but also a very sharp communicator.”  Mr Khan, the son of a Pakistani father and a Swiss mother, moved to Switzerland from Karachi aged 12. He worked as an apprentice in a local accountancy firm in the small town of Dübendorf from the age of 15, studying out of hours to earn a diploma and later qualifying as a chartered accountant. In 2001, he joined Ernst & Young, becoming the youngest ever partner of the firm’s Swiss arm at the age of 31. In 2013, he moved to Credit Suisse.  When Mr Thiam joined the bank two years later, Mr Khan stood out. “Iqbal really caught his eye,” says one senior Credit Suisse executive. When he was 40, Mr Khan was promoted to lead a new international wealth management division. In the next three years he boosted earnings from SFr1bn to SFr1.8bn, according to Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontobel. 
 Every year, Mr Khan threw a party for his top-performing lieutenants at a luxurious hotel high above Lake Lucerne. Expensive wine and champagne flowed, with Mr Khan overseeing proceedings like an indulgent monarch happy to dispense praise where it was due. “It was his court,” says one guest.  In March, Mr Thiam attended the annual bash. There was a noticeable chill between the two men. The rift that opened in January had widened. If Mr Khan was happy to dole out praise to those under him, he also expected his own achievements to be recognised.  When it became clear that Credit Suisse’s chairman, Urs Rohner, would not force Mr Thiam to give Mr Khan more of the limelight, he began talking to rivals. In late spring, he took a PowerPoint presentation to the board of Julius Baer, explaining why the Swiss private bank should make him its new head. Mr Khan was not short of other offers. But even after his resignation, Mr Thiam still saw in him a serious threat — and not without reason. The loyalty that Mr Khan commands from those who worked for him — and his reputation for getting results — made him more than just a pretender to the throne. Mr Khan had a legitimate claim.

"Credit Suisse rocked by suicide as spy scandal deepens ","Bank’s chief operating officer also steps down over surveillance of outgoing head of wealth management","A corporate espionage scandal rocking Credit Suisse deepened on Tuesday, after the suicide of a contractor involved in the surveillance of a high-flying executive who defected to rival UBS. The death of the consultant, who acted as a middle man between Credit Suisse and a private investigation firm, overshadowed the findings of an independent report into the decision to track the bank’s former head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan. Pierre-Olivier Bouée, Credit Suisse’s chief operating officer, submitted his resignation after the bank’s board heard details of the surveillance operation he ordered. The bank’s head of security, Remo Boccali, also resigned. Neither party will receive a pay-off, the bank said.  In a hastily arranged press conference on Tuesday, Urs Rohner, Credit Suisse’s chairman, said: “It was wrong to order the surveillance. The measures taken did not represent our standards. Those responsible for the observation should not be employed by the group.” Credit Suisse began its surveillance of Mr Khan last month because of fears that he was preparing to poach bankers and clients to bolster the fortunes of UBS, where he started work on Tuesday. The bank has been under pressure over the last week as details of the spying operation became public, including a chase and subsequent altercation between Mr Khan and a private investigator.  [The] reputation of our bank has suffered . . . I would like to apologise on behalf of Credit Suisse to our excellent employees, our shareholders, and to Iqbal Khan and his family for the consequencesUrs Rohner, Credit Suisse chairman Mr Khan has filed his own complaint with Zurich prosecutors about the surveillance. Mr Rohner said that the independent investigation by law firm Homburger had concluded that Mr Bouée had acted alone in ordering the surveillance and that Tidjane Thiam, the bank’s chief executive, was not involved.  “The whole thing is a tragedy, and the fact that someone took his life tells you it was all wrong from the beginning,” said one Credit Suisse shareholder. “Something here is deeply wrong. Right now we have Credit Suisse’s version of events and they’ve taken a decision. But clearly there will now be a version from the Swiss prosecutors.”  Zurich’s cantonal prosecutor on Tuesday said the death of the consultant was the subject of its inquiries. Based on current evidence, the incident was being treated as a suicide, a spokesperson for the prosecutor told the Financial Times. The prosecutor’s office said its investigations into potential criminal offences by those who ordered the surveillance against Mr Khan were still ongoing. The affair has raised questions over the judgment of Mr Thiam, who has led Credit Suisse since 2015. He and Mr Khan had an acrimonious relationship, stemming in part from a string of neighbour disputes concerning residences they each own in the wealthy suburb of Herrliberg in Zurich. Mr Rohner said that “the reputation of our bank has suffered . . . I would like to apologise on behalf of Credit Suisse to our excellent employees, our shareholders, and to Iqbal Khan and his family for the consequences.” He added that he did not want to pre-empt an official investigation by Zürich’s public prosecutor, but said that Homburger’s investigation concluded that Mr Thiam “neither gave the order, nor was he aware of it”.  “We strongly reject any assertions that call into question the integrity of our CEO,” Mr Rohner added.  Mr Rohner said that it was “with great sadness” that the bank had learned of the death of the security consultant. The security expert acted as a middle man between the bank and Investigo, the private investigation firm, according to one person briefed on the arrangement.  “We express our deep condolences. Out of respect to the relatives, we will not comment further on this matter,” he added.  Pierre-Olivier Bouée, Credit Suisse’s COO, submitted his resignation after the bank’s board heard details of a surveillance operation he ordered against Credit Suisse’s outgoing head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan  Asked whether Credit Suisse was in any way responsible for the person’s death, Mr Rohner replied: “We are greatly saddened.” John Tiner, a Credit Suisse director who oversaw Homburger’s investigation, said the law firm had found no evidence that Mr Khan had attempted to poach anyone, although he did continue to socialise with some employees after he was placed on gardening leave by the bank.  Mr Tiner said Homburger had conducted 14 interviews, including with Mr Khan, Credit Suisse employees, and the investigations company Investigo.  However, he warned that the law firm’s investigation was limited in two important respects. It did not have access to police files that might contain relevant information. And it could not retrieve deleted messages between Mr Bouée and Mr Boccali that were sent over Threema, a third-party messaging app.  Threema describes itself as a “proprietary, end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application” and markets itself under the tagline “seriously secure messaging”. An independent investigation by law firm Homburger had concluded that Mr Bouée had acted alone in ordering the surveillance and that Tidjane Thiam, pictured, the bank’s chief executive, was not involved © EPA-EFE Mr Tiner said that Homburger had concluded that Mr Bouée was aware that the plan to tail Mr Khan “entailed significant reputational risks” for the bank. The private investigation firm was “retained through a security consultant”, he added, and there were no “contemporaneous instructions” regarding its remit. Mr Tiner dismissed suggestions that Mr Thiam’s ignorance was a sign that he was not “on top” of the company, adding that Mr Bouée had acted in “a highly unusual and irregular” manner. Mr Rohner said the inquiry had not investigated the “personal differences” between Mr Thiam and Mr Khan, who were involved in an altercation at a cocktail party earlier this year. Nor had it looked at the “alleged planting of trees” — a reference to the neighbourly dispute.  However, Mr Rohner said he was responsible for allowing Mr Khan to start work at UBS without completing a six-month notice period and stint of gardening leave of up to one year.  Following “a dispute, a heated discussion” between Mr Thiam and Mr Khan, Mr Rohner had initially concluded that the pair were able to continue working together. But, in time, it became clear a “long-term collaboration on mutual trust was not possible and Mr Khan wanted to leave the group”. “I helped broker a termination agreement with Mr Khan, a mutually beneficial agreement,” he said.  One person briefed on the arrangements said “this could have all been avoided” if Mr Khan had been subject to the normal notice period, which is designed in part to ensure that outgoing employees cannot poach colleagues or clients. Asked whether he had considered resigning, Mr Rohner said: “I consider my position as chairman every day. My job is to protect the integrity of this company. If I see something that doesn’t go right, we will take the necessary action.” Mr Rohner said that the Homburger investigation was now complete and dismissed suggestions that it had concluded too early. But he said the bank would continue to investigate whether it should overhaul its security unit, which might have to report to the bank’s legal and compliance department rather than the chief operating officer.  Credit Suisse said it had appointed James Walker to succeed Mr Bouée as chief operating officer. It said Mr Walker currently held several senior roles in the bank’s finance organisation, including chief financial officer of key US subsidiaries and head of product control. As the damage to Credit Suisse’s reputation has grown with more details of the operation and the disputes which led to it leaking into the open, shareholders in the bank have rallied to support Mr Thiam’s leadership.  Harris Associates, Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, told the Financial Times on Sunday that Mr Thiam’s stewardship should not be called into question by the events.  “These are humans; people aren’t flawless,” said Harris’s deputy chairman, David Herro. “They don’t make perfect decisions every time. And this is why, unless laws have been broken, this doesn’t seem like a case for anyone losing their job . . . Perhaps . . . some poor judgment was shown in the way to best protect the stakeholders from a departing executive. I think at this point this is the worst that can be said.”","01.10.2019"
"Best of Lex: your weekly round-up","WeWork, Thomas Cook, Credit Suisse, Alibaba, eBay and climate change","Dear readers, In a number of cultures, a 21st birthday once legitimised a person’s adulthood. It is a coming of age, leaving behind the last strictures of adolescence. Google celebrates this same anniversary today. Whether it gets more freedom from regulatory restraints is a moot point. This past week, Google made a bold celebratory claim. It managed “quantum supremacy”, creating a computer that can make calculations beyond the ability of today’s most powerful supercomputers. Frankly, given all the legal uproar in the UK parliament over its prorogation and the threat of an impeachment of President Donald Trump in the US, just processing the daily news requires a lot of computational power.  Then there’s the palaver over WeWork. Lex has spent plenty of time on its overvaluation and quirky management style. This week we lobbed a couple more clods of mud at the shiny front windows of this office space provider. Allegations of his marijuana smoking on corporate jets aside, Adam Neumann was already facing a tough battle to keep his job as chief executive. Never mind Mr Neumann’s peculiar style, what about that of key investor Masayoshi Son at SoftBank, queried Lex. Before Lex could catch its collective breath from the WeWork saga, Mr Neumann had lost his chief executive role. Good thing he cashed out of $700m of shares before the initial public offering could be cancelled. Lex wondered whether Mr Neumann, even as a non-executive chair, will still exercise plenty of influence nonetheless. Speaking of chaotic situations, the demise of travel business Thomas Cook not only brought an end to a 178-year-old enterprise but also created a headache for unfortunate vacationers, not to mention the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority. The agency had to retrieve 150,000 holiday makers from far-flung countries. Meanwhile, spare a thought for thousands of employees struggling to get their charges home, knowing their jobs had gone. Lex blamed a string of ineffectual bosses for straining the group’s finances after some poor strategic decisions. While no one believes these leaders deserved major rewards for this outcome, the charge that these chief executives had been vastly overpaid was, Lex thought, extreme.  On the subject of extremes, the FT’s reporting on a major spat between two Credit Suisse executives caught Lex’s eye. News of clashes between Tidjane Thiam, the bank’s chief executive, and his erstwhile colleague Iqbal Khan, soon to start at rival UBS, created some lurid headlines in Switzerland. The bust-up raises questions about the credibility and quality of leadership at Credit Suisse, said Lex. One way to measure corporate leaders is how well they manage their successions. Daniel Zhang, the new chairman of China’s foremost ecommerce group Alibaba, has some big shoes to fill. Founder Jack Ma struggled through penury to create one of the largest conglomerates anywhere. For most of that time he had the fair wind of Beijing’s support at his back, something Mr Zhang does not necessarily have. He will have to convince shareholders, opined Lex, that he can shake off the heavy hand of government. On the opposite side of the Pacific, the leader of another top ecommerce group, eBay, had to deal with a different sort of obstructive force. Now that Devin Wenig has exited, activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value have a better chance of breaking up eBay. They want to sell off units such as the online ticket-exchange StubHub and the Classifieds Group. However, Lex noted that the problem of eBay’s sluggish core ecommerce business remains unresolved. Finally, we noted the many comments about last weekend’s note comparing the carbon efficacy per hectare of solar (PV) panels against planting trees. Most of you complained about the brief analysis involved. One reader helpfully described the piece as: “Quite possibly the most disappointingly facile and potentially misleading Lex commentary I have seen.” While we do appreciate all your comments, Lex felt that this simple analysis did offer readers some utility.  Wherever you are this weekend, Lex hopes the sun shines on you. Alan Livsey Lex Research Editor

"Credit Suisse poaches top Deutsche Bank analyst to lead strategy","Kinner Lakhani latest high-profile figure to leave German lender amid radical revamp","Credit Suisse has hired Deutsche Bank’s top European company analyst and adviser in the latest high-profile departure from the German lender as it undergoes a radical retrenchment. Kinner Lakhani, who also ran European financials research for Deutsche, will join the Swiss lender in Zurich this month as head of strategy and development. He will report directly to chief executive Tidjane Thiam. “Kinner . . . is among the most respected voices in the industry,” Mr Thiam said on Wednesday. He “will work closely with our divisions and corporate functions as we drive incremental growth and assess opportunities to further expand our leading global footprint.”  Under Mr Thiam, Credit Suisse has been shrinking its investment bank and expanding in wealth management, particularly targeting ultra-wealthy entrepreneurs in Asia, as part of a strategy to improve the stability of its earnings. Mr Lakhani’s departure is another blow for Deutsche, which has suffered an exodus of its top people over the past few years as its investment bank struggled to make a consistent profit and defend its market position against increasingly dominant US rivals.  In July the lender announced it was closing its entire lossmaking equity sales and trading operation but decided to retain its company research arm to support its capital markets businesses. Mr Lakhani became Deutsche’s head of European research a year ago, succeeding Paul Reynolds who left for BNP Paribas. Other significant departures include Deutsche’s top financial institutions advisory banker, Tadhg Flood, who quit to join Centerview Partners around the same time in 2018. Deutsche said Gerry Gallagher, head of European consumer research, would take Mr Lakhani’s role. Mr Lakhani made his name covering banks in a two-decade career with stints at ABN Amro, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup before joining Deutsche in 2015. He trained as an accountant at the London School of Economics. His move comes against the backdrop of Mifid 2, a new regulatory framework that has shaken up European lenders’ research activities by requiring banks to charge clients directly for access to research. In the past it was provided for free in an attempt to drum up fee-generating business.  The rules have prompted many fund managers to cut back on the amount of research they pay for, leaving banks and brokerages competing for slices of a smaller pie and reviewing the size and cost of their analyst teams.","11.09.2019"
"BNP Paribas/Credit Suisse: extreme banking","The two European banks are among the leaders in a bedraggled pack","Animals evolve in severe environments, so do European banks. Better than expected second quarter results showed France’s BNP Paribas and Switzerland’s Credit Suisse adapting to harsh conditions. Their share prices edged higher. The sector remains far from fighting fit.  European bankers blame parched profitability on ultra-low interest rates, which have eroded margins. Weak economies have restricted growth. Regulators have required extra layers of capital fat. In fickle markets, BNP and Credit Suisse both benefited from investment bank restructuring. BNP will pick up broking business from weaker German rival Deutsche Bank. Like Credit Suisse, however, it has sought to have smart-suited investment bankers support other units rather than ramp up volatility. BNP is concentrated in sluggish Europe. Boss Jean-Laurent Bonnafé is eking operational improvements out of retail and commercial operations. When interest rates are floored, fee and commission income compensates.  Credit Suisse is a play on global wealth management. Richer clients are more inclined to fee-based transactions, reducing interest rate sensitivity. But it depends heavily on Switzerland, where 10-year government bonds now yield minus 0.8 per cent. Pre-tax profits at the Swiss universal bank rose 18 per cent to SFr654m, or two-fifths the divisional total. Much of the improvement was transitory, however, flattered by property sales. Strip out real estate gains and profits rose 3 per cent. Selling bank branches and other buildings makes sense in a central bank-fuelled property bubble. It cannot compensate endlessly for negative interest rates.  BNP and Credit Suisse have outperformed European bank stocks this year. Credit Suisse lifted returns on tangible equity to 10 per cent from 7 a year ago. BNP was flat at 11 per cent. In an ailing sector, however, double-digit returns stand out. The two are among the leaders in a bedraggled pack.  Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Click here to sign up.

"UBS hires Credit Suisse veteran Iqbal Khan as wealth head","Asset management leadership also changed in reshuffle at Swiss lender","UBS has appointed veteran European banker Iqbal Khan to its board as the world’s largest wealth manager moves to address concerns about succession planning and lacklustre performance. Mr Khan, whose next career move has been the subject of much speculation after his sudden departure from Credit Suisse in July following an internal power struggle, will take over from Martin Blessing on October 1 as co-head of wealth management alongside Tom Naratil. Mr Blessing is leaving UBS. Suni Harford will replace Ulrich Körner as head of the bank’s asset management business and will join Mr Khan on the group executive board, while chief operating officer Sabine Keller-Busse will take over Mr Körner’s other role as president of UBS in Europe, Middle East and Africa.  The appointments make Ms Keller-Busse, Mr Khan and Mr Naratil the most likely contenders to succeed Sergio Ermotti, who became chief executive in 2011 and was widely expected to serve for a decade.  They also end a period of doubt about succession planning after the unexpected departure last year of Andrea Orcel, who had been widely tipped as the next CEO, for the top job at Santander — an offer the Spanish lender subsequently withdrew. Mr Khan’s immediate challenge is to turn round the fortunes of the wealth management business, which had a 12 per cent fall in profits in the second quarter as cautious clients shifted to lower-margin products, growth slowed in Asia and wealthy US customers made withdrawals leading to $2bn in outflows. Executives at UBS are hoping that Mr Khan will repeat his record at Credit Suisse: pre-tax income at the wealth management division there was SFr723m in 2015, the year he took charge of it. By 2018, it had risen to SFr1.7bn and assets under management had grown from SFr290bn to SFr358bn. His three main objectives will be to expand business with ultra-wealthy clients, particularly in the US; to find growth in Asia-Pacific; and an ongoing restructuring of the European business. “This is probably an attempt to detract attention away from the suppressed revenue outlook,” said Russell Quelch, an analyst at Redburn, commenting on the management moves. He said that UBS’s main challenge was to encourage clients to move assets out of cash and into higher-earning products, given low interest rates.  He reckoned that Mr Khan would have more credibility with clients than Mr Blessing, who had moved to UBS from Commerzbank, the struggling German lender, in 2016.  Mr Quelch said Mr Kahn’s credentials were “undoubtable” whereas Mr Blessing did not seem to go down as well with clients. But a UBS banker said that Mr Blessing had been very close to clients and was “the nicest executive you will ever meet”.","29.08.2019"
"Credit Suisse second-quarter profit defies bleak backdrop","Strong performance from trading offset by weakness in capital markets","Credit Suisse reported a 45 per cent surge in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, driven by strong performances at its investment bank, beating expectations and defying the bleak backdrop for European financials. The formerly lossmaking markets operations built on momentum from the start of the year and posted a 7 per cent increase in bond and rates-trading revenue and a flat performance in equities. The overall 4 per cent rise in trading compares with the average 8 per cent drop seen at US rivals and declines in both fixed-income and equities at Swiss rival UBS, which reported last week. Credit Suisse shares gained 4.9 per cent to SFr12.32 after the news. “We view these as strong results,” said Citigroup analyst Andrew Coombs. “Global markets have been the main cause of earnings downgrades over the past 18 months, but have now shown signs of recovery for a second consecutive quarter.” Earnings at the Swiss bank rose 18 per cent to SFr654m ($660m), which the bank said was a record for the quarter and beat estimates despite the negative rate environment in Switzerland, which means it costs the bank to hold deposits.  While pre-tax profit at the group’s flagship wealth management unit also improved 3 per cent to SFr444m, it came in slightly under analysts’ forecasts.  Credit Suisse overall attracted SFr9.5bn of net new assets from wealthy clients — versus $2bn of outflows at UBS — increasing the total under management to a record SFr797bn. Chief executive Tidjane Thiam said his ambition was to increase AUM to SFr1tn over time to improve the stability of the bank’s returns. “These results, delivered in a challenging environment, indicate that our bank has emerged from three years of restructuring with a strong franchise,” said Mr Thiam. Many other bank executives have warned of a worsening environment due to the prospect of a US-Chinese trade war and rate cuts in Europe and the US. The broadly positive quarter adds momentum to Mr Thiam’s turnround of Credit Suisse. He returned the 162-year-old Swiss lender to profit last year, ending a three-year lossmaking streak during which it made SFr6.7bn of losses as it unwound risky leveraged trading positions, cut more than 10,000 jobs and paid big misconduct fines around the world. Mr Thiam has curtailed and refocused the volatile and capital-intensive trading operations to expand the more profitable and predictable wealth management and private banking units, particularly in Asia. Overall second-quarter group net profit climbed to SFr937m from SFr647m, beating analysts’ expectations for SFr788m, as revenue remained stable at around SFr5.6bn while operating expenses declined 5 per cent to SFr4.3bn. At the Asia-Pacific unit, a persistent trouble spot for the lender, pre-tax profit rose 9 per cent as good wealth management income was offset by tepid investment banking. Revenue from trading in the region fell 16 per cent, paring gains in markets seen elsewhere in the world. “There is more we can do in markets in Asia” and our different business units “need to work better together”, Mr Thiam said on a call with analysts. The investment bank’s advisory and capital markets operation was also weaker, posting revenue down 30 per cent, a worrying trend after the unit slumped to a pre-tax loss in the first quarter when income dropped by a similar amount.  Executives blamed “lower client activity as investor concerns lingered over global trade negotiations and slowing GDP growth”. Rival UBS reported a double-digit surge in earnings from the same business last week. Mr Thiam said it was an “unfortunate situation” because “we have had a higher proportion of our deals delayed or cancelled than other players”, but “we don’t see anything broken” with the business. However, he added: “We are doing what we can to flex the costs . . . [we] have pressed down pretty hard on compensation” and made some redundancies already, but the franchise is “absolutely vital” for ultra-wealthy client relationships, especially entrepreneurs who rely on the unit for IPOs. Credit Suisse made a return on tangible equity of 9.7 per cent in the quarter, up from 6.9 per cent last year, on track to hit its target of 10 to 11 per cent this year. Mr Thiam ended with a note of caution in his outlook, telling reporters “we are pleased with the results but are not complacent, it’s a very tough environment out there and the third-quarter looks difficult”.","31.07.2019"

"A Swiss banking drama on Lake Zurich","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.   
  We know some of you come to DD for the drama of finance. So for today’s item you have Credit Suisse to thank for delivering a spectacle worthy of a spy novel (much better than Jamie Dimon’s recent film pitch). A man and his wife are being chased by three corporate spies down the picturesque streets of Zurich, by car and on foot. They reach the Swiss National Bank in the city’s charming old town where a physical confrontation ensues. At least that is Iqbal Khan’s (above right) version of events. The former head of wealth management at Credit Suisse was being tailed by a spy firm called Investigo on orders from his former employer after he abruptly left for its rival UBS. The bank was trailing Khan on suspicions that he would take Credit Suisse clients and employees with him. Hiring a private detective (Credit Suisse insists there was only one) to trail a former employee isn’t against the law, but in the staid world of Swiss banking it’s an extreme measure and one that seems to have backfired on the bank. So why risk it? There’s a personal and professional element to this narrative. First, wealth management is one of the few areas where European banks are making some money and it’s a speciality for Swiss lenders.  As the FT’s John Gapper writes this week, capital constraints have squeezed profits at almost every other division, particularly investment banking, but wealth management doesn’t require much capital and returns on equity are high. That makes private bankers a desirable lot, not to mention those who have built close relationships over the years, with some advising on as much as $1bn of fortunes. Still, plenty of wealth managers leave their jobs and don’t end up in a scuffle outside Switzerland’s most important financial institution with a spy (or spies) that has been hired by their former employer. Relations between Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam and Khan had been souring for a while. The pair worked well together at first and Khan was considered a “star” by his boss. But there are few ways to vex your superior more than by buying and redeveloping a house immediately next to theirs. The inevitable happened. Thiam and Khan fell out over a dispute about some trees planted on the Thiam property. The confrontation (over trees!) almost got physical according to some reports and Khan’s wife had to separate them. Khan started plotting his exit from Credit Suisse and informally met or was interviewed by several international and Swiss banks before landing a job at UBS. The controversy shows no signs of ending however, and it doesn’t look like either party are willing to hold out an olive branch. The FT’s Stephen Morris explains how the drama unfolded here. Gupta gets by with a little help from his friends Sanjeev Gupta, the UK industrialist who turns 48 today, loves to celebrate in style.  At the start of the month, he hosted a lavish party at the mansion he is renting in Sydney, according to the Australian Financial Review. And last week the man dubbed Britain’s “saviour of steel” was seen on a whistle-stop tour to mark the purchase of seven steelworks in mainland Europe by his Liberty House group. But on that tour, he faced tough questions from a TV interviewer about his funding, including how Liberty had paid for the European steel plants. “From our own equity and a little bit of debt,” Gupta replied, as flags with his corporate logos flapped in the breeze behind him. We know DD readers want a more specific answer than that. A new deep dive into the opaque financing underpinning Gupta’s business empire from the FT’s Michael Pooler and Robert Smith provides exactly that. Need a teaser? Their story reveals that Liberty signed a new €2.2bn debt facility to fund the purchase of the steelworks from ArcelorMittal, three times the €740m price he paid for the assets. Need more? Instead of a conventional bank, Gupta turned to an Australian financier whose meteoric rise has been closely intertwined with the Indian-born businessman, Lex Greensill (who is also a confidante of David Cameron,former UK prime minister). His eponymous firm, Greensill Capital, is backed by the Japanese technology conglomerate
SoftBank’s Vision Fund, which put $800m into the business at a $3.5bn valuation earlier this year. To discuss the story further or if you’d like to share your thoughts, feel free to contact DD’s Robert Smith here. Not so fast Peloton JPMorgan Chase has been in the news more than it would like this week, and that was before Peloton’s listing on Thursday. The buzzy exercise bike company did little to help matters. After JPMorgan bankers priced Peloton’s offering at $29 per share — top of its range — the company opened at $27 and traded as low as $24.75, or a drop of 14.7 per cent, before closing 11.2 per cent lower at $25.76.  Peloton’s slide recalls SmileDirectClub’s flotation, in which the teeth straightening upstart’s shares dropped 28 per cent after pricing above expectations on the advice of JPMorgan. Both offerings raised more than $1bn for the lossmaking debutantes. That comes after the shelved WeWork IPO — also led by JPMorgan — which will rank as one to forget for Jamie Dimon. Lucky for Peloton, its poor public debut was overshadowed by Endeavor, owner of Hollywood’s largest talent agency. The company pulled its offering on Thursday after failing to entice investors, even with a more than 30 per cent discount on its expected range. JPMorgan can relax — Goldman Sachs was taking the lead on that one. The fashion deal heralded as pure ‘magic’ Dealmaking is alive and well in Paris as the months-long unveiling of designer fashion collections builds to its climax. No, French luxury goods houses LVMH and Kering weren’t haggling over some hot new brand to add to their portfolios. Front rows have been abuzz over the latest from Dries Van Noten, the famed designer and member of the Antwerp Six, and his collaboration with former LVMH-backed designer Christian Lacroix.  This wasn’t your typical capsule collection, the sort that H&M and Target have flanked over the past decade. Those often seem like little more than self-serving exchanges: the young designer gets exposure, while the big brand gets something fresh to hawk to consumers. No, what Van Noten and Lacroix have achieved is something greater. The FT has likened it to magic. The New York Times called it “the collaboration to end all collaborations”.

"Deutsche woos 13 wealth bankers from Credit Suisse","Ultra-high net worth team to be paid ‘danger money’ at troubled lender","Deutsche Bank is poaching a team of 13 bankers from Credit Suisse in Italy as the troubled lender seeks to increase its wealth management business even as it has been forced to make dramatic cuts to its staff elsewhere. The new team is expected to be led by Roberto Coletta, currently head of ultra-high net worth individuals in Italy at Credit Suisse, and will focus on serving the ultra-wealthy with assets of $30m or more, as rivals such as UBS intensify their focus on the super-rich.  The move comes after the appointment of Claudio de Sanctis, who joined Deutsche Bank Wealth Management as its new head of Europe last year from Credit Suisse. It follows the move of two other senior Credit Suisse bankers in London to Deutsche in June. One industry insider said the new team was being paid “danger money” for working at Deutsche, whose share price has hit record lows this year, with the bankers receiving pay raises of up to 40 per cent as well as matching their 2018 bonuses. A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the job moves. But Mr de Sanctis said that recent hires made by the wealth management team had always been at market price. “We have a great story to tell and when you have a great story to tell you don’t need to pay over market price,” he told the Financial Times. He said that Italy was the second most important market for Deutsche behind Germany, and that it aimed to be the number one foreign bank across Europe in the ultra-wealthy space.  Mr de Sanctis said Deutsche Bank had a competitive edge in serving entrepreneurial clients through its corporate banking arm, who then often go on to be clients of the wealth management arm once they have sold their company -— a form of cross-selling commonly seen at global banks. A spokesperson for Credit Suisse said: “Credit Suisse is fully committed to Italy and in particular to our Italian clients. We have been serving our Italian clients for 30 years with our local and global capabilities in wealth management, asset management and investment banking. We will continue to grow, invest in and hire senior talents in this key market, which is of strategic importance to Credit Suisse.” Deutsche Bank last week announced a radical strategic overhaul to its business model as chief executive Christian Sewing said the lender would shut Deutsche’s lossmaking equities trading business, shrink its bond and rates trading operations and cull 18,000 jobs worldwide. Yet Deutsche still plans to make hires in its wealth management arm, with an aim of adding 300 new relationship and investment managers by 2021 — an increase in headcount of about a third.","16.07.2019"

"Stocks to watch: Aston Martin, Babcock, EDF, Wirecard, Siemens","Frontier Developments could be a takeover target as gaming shifts to the cloud, says Credit Suisse","Tuesday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Aston Martin retreated after the carmaker sought to shore up its balance sheet in preparation for next year’s launch of a DBX sports-utility vehicle with a $150m bond sale. The financing was priced at an interest rate of 12 per cent per annum, with an option to raise another $100m in delayed drawdown notes at 15 per cent per annum. With full-year debt expected to hit £1.23bn, Aston Martin “has reached the ceiling in terms of the amount of term debt and cash interest burden that it can sustainably service”, said S&P Global Ratings.  Interest costs would cut Aston Martin’s 2019 profit before tax by 18 per cent to £17.6m, with 2020 profit falling 15 per cent to £95m, forecast Numis Securities. “We see the additional financing as positive, if expensive, with significant potential as the DBX plan unfolds, albeit a few more positive lines on the delivery programmes will be needed before the shares perform.” ● Babcock rallied on a reassuring update and a positive conference call from the heavy-industry outsourcer, which focused on the international contract opportunities. Trading in the first half ending in September was in line with expectations and full-year targets were left unchanged.  “On the positive side, the shares look cheap on an historic dividend yield of 5.3 per cent . . . and the reconfirmed guidance today is encouraging. However, our concern is that UK political uncertainty probably increases further over the next six months and therefore more decisions could be delayed or cancelled, which could impact the 55 per cent of revenues which are UK public sector-related.”Panmure Gordon ● EDF led the Stoxx Europe 600 fallers after warning of more construction problems at its Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in the UK. Difficult ground conditions and design complexities meant sinking between £1.9bn and £2.9bn into the project, which pushed the total cost as high as £22.5bn, as well as increasing the risk of a delay to the switch-on target of 2025.  EDF had already flagged the possibility of cost overruns but had guided towards a £700m increase. The utility’s projected rate of return fell from 8.5 per cent to between 7.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent. Analysts also highlighted an article in French newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné suggesting EDF’s Flamanville nuclear project in Normandy may cost up to €15.5bn, compared with the company’s most recent estimate of €10.9bn. ASN, the French nuclear regulator, has yet to determine whether it agrees with EDF’s opinion that reactor components used at the Flamanville site are fit for service. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse started coverage of video games developers Frontier Developments and Ubisoft with “outperform” ratings. Its target prices were £14.90 and €92 respectively. Gaming “has long surpassed movies and music to be by far the largest form of content”, with the industry worth $139bn last year and expected to grow annually by 9 per cent to 2022, said Credit Suisse.  The broker saw four structural drivers to growth. The creation of online gaming communities would extend product lives and improve in-game monetisation, it said. Cloud gaming could also attract new players for premium titles, while free-to-play mobile games and international markets could expand the broader audience. Digital distribution should help margins for publishers too, the broker said. Based on a survey of 4,000 gamers, Credit Suisse found that most players have strong loyalty to just two or three games and would be willing to switch to subscription payments. The survey also showed a strong uptake of in-app purchases in pre-to-play games, particularly in China. Ubisoft “has one of the most extensive portfolios of AAA games in the industry, with more than eight major franchises. This balances revenue and means the company is not especially vulnerable to the success or failure of any one title. The company has also invested extensively in its own studios so that it controls all its intellectual property. This makes it less vulnerable to rises in third-party IP [intellectual property] costs and allows it to control and improve the speed of content delivery and game releases.”Credit Suisse Frontier Developments has a successful record, a strong balance sheet and a relatively small cost base that keeps break-even costs low, Credit Suisse said. Cloud gaming launches from Amazon, Sony and Microsoft will provide an opportunity grow its audience beyond console owners, as well as raising the possibility of consolidation, it said. ● UBS downgraded Wirecard, the German payments processing group, from “buy” to “neutral” with a €151-a-share target price. With key performance indicators such as transaction volume having peaked over the past 18 months, Wirecard cannot sustain its current high organic revenue growth over the medium term, UBS said. Total merchant numbers grew 20 per cent in the second quarter 2019 but this was driven by an increase in “micro-merchants”, mainly in Brazil, said the broker. Meanwhile, sign-up growth among the large- and midsized customers responsible for 90 per cent of Wirecard’s total transaction volume had been weakening since the end of 2017, it said.  UBS also questioned Wirecard’s acquisition strategy, saying consolidation of merchant portfolios was taking longer than expected and performance in Africa and the Americas had been volatile. Four deals since March 2017 had added €28bn of transaction volumes and €374m of revenue, or 42 per cent of the total sales guidance upgrade for the period, but the boost to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation via those acquisitions has only been 13 per cent or €37m, it calculated.  “Although Wirecard repeatedly emphasised an organic growth story driven by partnerships with banks and insurance companies, given the expected slowdown in organic growth, we think a change in strategy is possible,” said UBS. With Wirecard currently raising around €1.4bn via a bond sale and the issue of convertible debt to SoftBank, the reaction to possible acquisitions “is hard to gauge”, it said.  Finally, UBS highlighted SoftBank’s move last week to reduce its liability to a Wirecard €900m convertible bond. “We think for Wirecard investors this raises questions about how much confidence SoftBank has in both the upside and downside of the relationship.” Daily newsletter

"Nothing can guard against the fallout from a personal feud","When tensions between executives boil over, it demonstrates a failure of management and supervision","In the upper echelons of big business, security paranoia and corporate ego go hand in hand. A whole industry of intelligence consultants, private eyes, security experts and vendors of high-end kit exists to cater to both. “Security” is one of the ways chief executives justify their corporate jet — or two corporate jets in the case of Jeffrey Immelt, the former General Electric boss, who occasionally took a spare plane with him on business trips. Which senior manager would not feel a surge of power being preceded out of a customised SUV by burly men with shades and earpieces urgently whispering, “The eagle has landed”, as he or she arrives for the quarterly sales conference? I suspect that in the same way that chaos or coincidence is usually a better explanation than conspiracy, much of the corporate security rigmarole is expensively superfluous, more Johnny English than James Bond. Certainly, if executives appreciated the absurdity of some of their antics, they would be better, and humbler, managers. Take the dispute playing out at Credit Suisse between chief executive Tidjane Thiam and Iqbal Khan, who quit as head of the bank’s wealth management business in July. The bank hired private eyes from a firm with the cartoonish name Investigo to trail Mr Khan, suspecting he might try to poach other bankers for his move to rival Swiss bank UBS. Mr Khan alleged he was chased through Zurich, by car and on foot. An Investigo gumshoe claimed, on the contrary, he was chased by Mr Khan. A mission that promised delicate spycraft and clandestine surveillance seems to have culminated instead, according to Mr Khan’s account, in an embarrassingly public Keystone Cops-style physical confrontation in the shadow of the Swiss National Bank. It is undeniable that high-pressure, high-profile, highly paid executive roles can come with their share of genuine threat, rising from hacking and industrial espionage to actual bodily harm. Alfred Herrhausen, Deutsche Bank chief executive, was assassinated by a roadside bomb in 1989, despite travelling in an armoured Mercedes. Jorge Paulo Lemann, founder of 3G, the private equity group behind Kraft Heinz and AB InBev, moved permanently to Switzerland from Brazil after gunmen tried to kidnap his three youngest children in 1999. Rupert Murdoch has been a stickler for security ever since a botched attempt to kidnap his then wife Anna in 1969 led to the murder of the wife of one of his senior executives — a saga at the centre of the West End play Ink. The fear provoked by rare incidents such as these tends to trickle down the corporate hierarchy. The chief executive of a medium-sized UK business once pleaded with me not to publish the precise details of his weekly schedule because it would reveal the one night a week that he regularly spent away from home and could put his wife and children at risk of burglary or kidnap. It is hard for outside observers to assess how serious such dangers are and how far companies should go to prevent them. There are sound commercial reasons why Credit Suisse was prepared to take measures to secure its lucrative wealth management franchise following Mr Khan’s departure. But while Mr Thiam and the younger Mr Khan are both proud, talented and successful financial executives, paid more than most, they were also indulging in the sort of petty personal rivalry instantly recognisable to the rest of us. That this tension was allowed to bubble up so furiously and damagingly speaks to a failure of management and supervision, for which Credit Suisse’s chairman Urs Rohner and board should take part of the blame. Deliciously, Mr Khan and Mr Thiam’s feud frothed over into their home lives. Mr Khan moved next door to his boss and they allegedly fell out over, among other things, the younger man’s noisy building work and some trees that Mr Thiam had planted on his property. In other words, this was the stuff of banal but often bitter neighbourhood disputes the world over, whether on Lake Zurich’s luxurious “Gold Coast”, where the two men lived, or on some ordinary cul-de-sac in middle America. Mr Khan is now on gardening leave ahead of a move to UBS. (If Investigo’s spies are at a loose end, they may wish to listen out for the sound of revving chainsaws on a weekday morning in the vicinity of Mr Thiam’s property.) Credit Suisse has told staff that the media reports have “sensationalised both facts and events”. Perhaps that is true. Downplay the overexcited coverage of spies and car chases, though, and this story boils down to a mundane tale of two men bickering over suburban shrubbery. Other managers should remember how unseemly that looks before they allow overblown, ego-driven personal antipathy to rock their organisations. andrew.hill@ft.com

"Credit Suisse/China: Swiss pandering","A tilt towards fast-growing Asian markets underpins bank’s restructuring strategy","A global trade war looms. A Swiss bank shows its diplomatic finesse. Credit Suisse on Monday appointed Zhenyi Tang, former chairman of Asia-focused CLSA broker, as its China chief executive. It is no coincidence Mr Tang served 17 years in China’s finance ministry. Svelte Swiss wealth managers in well-tailored suits are not about to storm China. But a local boss with book full of Beijing contacts should give Credit Suisse an edge, especially over US rivals. A tilt towards fast-growing Asian markets underpins Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam’s restructuring strategy. The Asia Pacific unit’s reported pre-tax income fell 9 per cent to SFr664m in 2018, however, hit late in the year by Asian financial market turmoil. Attracting China’s offshore riches is one thing. But the onshore market is four-fifths of the wealth of Chinese worth $1m or more, says Deutsche Bank. Capital controls and restrictions on ownership have entrenched domestic service providers, however.  Foreign rivals such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Nomura have footholds. Trumpian geopolitics have made life difficult for US banks such as JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs. Furthest ahead in putting bankers’ boots on the ground is Swiss rival UBS, which in December increased its stake in a local securities joint venture to 51 per cent.  UBS’s local Shanghai boss, Eugene Qian, is a longtime banker who started his career in London. In appointing Mr Tang, Credit Suisse is deploying a classic banking tactic — using a government veteran to open doors. In this respect, China is nothing special. In France, HSBC bank’s local chief executive, Jean Beunardeau, is a former French finance ministry official.  But the politics are still more sensitive in China. Building a wealth management franchise pitched at billionaire entrepreneurs will require a network of national and regional licences — as well as investment sophistication or local expertise in areas such as inheritance planning. A Beijing operative should help. So, too, will the neutral Swiss flag.

"Bankers’ tin ears on bonus claims will deepen social tensions","Credit Suisse and Andrea Orcel show it is no longer shameful to fight for high pay","Andrea Orcel, the former head of investment banking at UBS, has brought a €100m legal case against Spain's Banco Santander © Bloomberg Remember the repentance of bankers after the financial crisis? It wasn’t quite the display of self-flagellation that some reformers would have liked. The Occupy Wall Street movement did not provoke the overthrow of capitalism. But there was a degree of moderation. Banks urged their staff not to flaunt their bonuses by dashing out and buying Ferraris. As banks’ profitability fell, banker pay dipped a little too. And in the EU, new rules prevented bonuses from exceeding two times basic pay. But if last week’s news is any guide, it is no longer shameful to fight for the right to high pay. Lawsuits brought by Credit Suisse and former UBS investment banking chief Andrea Orcel are clear evidence that defiance over bankers’ bonuses is returning. First, consider Mr Orcel’s €100m case against Banco Santander, brought on the grounds of alleged breach of contract after the Spanish bank rescinded its offer to make him chief executive.  Mr Orcel had already resigned from UBS to take the job on the understanding that he would be compensated for the value of his deferred pay tied up with the Swiss bank. But between the initial job offer last autumn and early 2019 the Santander board balked at the cost of covering his buyout, worth an estimated €50m. The additional €50m in the claim apparently relates to lost potential earnings and projected costs including legal fees. It was clearly a horrible position for Mr Orcel, or anyone else for that matter, to find himself in: resigning from one role to find the dream job you thought you were moving to no longer exists. He can take some comfort that the money he has lost out on pales compared with the decline in UBS’s market value, down by nearly €10bn since his departure. The case itself will rest on the legal point of whether Mr Orcel had a contractual entitlement to the money and whether the contract was breached. And contracts should of course be honoured. But the law is only part of the story here. Weighing the ethics of the case throws up far bigger questions. Can and should society accept a value of €100m being put on an individual — especially a banker? Is Mr Orcel living in a parallel universe? After all, the 2008 crisis — triggered in part by greedy financiers — led pretty clearly, via economic meltdown, monetary policy and government austerity, to a widening of the gap between the haves and have-nots. Mr Orcel himself was a key adviser on the takeover of ABN Amro, which triggered the collapse of RBS and its record £46bn bailout. The rise of hate-preaching populist politicians — from Donald Trump in the US to the far-right across Europe — can at least in part be traced back to the mayhem caused by the financial crash. The other case that hit the headlines this week involved Credit Suisse taking the UK’s HM Revenue & Customs to court in an attempt to reclaim £239m of tax paid in 2010 in relation to a post-crisis bankers’ bonus tax imposed for a period of four months by then chancellor Alistair Darling. Because some other banks chose not to pay bonuses during that period, Credit Suisse is claiming discrimination. John McDonnell, Mr Darling’s successor as Labour finance chief, said last month: “This is outrageous and Credit Suisse should pay these taxes. People in this country want the rich to shoulder their fair share of responsibilities.” Mr McDonnell may be dismissed by some as a hard-left politician. But on this he has a powerful point. There is a pretty direct connection between the £239m that Credit Suisse paid the Exchequer and the ability of government — in the particularly straitened times of 2010 — to fund the UK’s hospitals and schools. The bank would argue that unlike many rivals it did not need government bailout money in the crisis and that it pays plenty of tax, including SFr1.4 bn of income tax last year. But like Mr Orcel, it is evident that Credit Suisse has a tin ear. Both have deemed the reputational pummelling they will get from bringing these cases to be worth it in the name of legal justice. The broader danger is that the public profile attracted by such legal fights further tarnishes the unloved but vital banking sector — and magnifies the them-and-us feeling across society, with still untold ramifications for our world. patrick.jenkins@ft.com

"Credit Suisse loses court challenge over UK banker bonus tax","Swiss lender was seeking to claw back £239m levy imposed in wake of financial crisis","Credit Suisse has lost a high-profile legal battle with the UK’s tax authorities to claw back £239m it paid as a levy on banker bonuses after the financial crisis. The Swiss bank launched a High Court lawsuit to recoup money it had paid on a temporary tax introduced in 2009 by then chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling amid widespread anger over pay levels in an industry blamed for the country’s economic woes. The one-off bank payroll tax, a 50 per cent levy on individual bonuses of more than £25,000, was paid by banks rather than the employees. Credit Suisse reduced the bonus pool for 400 of its bankers based in the UK by a third to fund the bill. Credit Suisse argued in the High Court this year that it should be repaid the money because the way the bank payroll tax was imposed over a four-month period was unfair.  It claimed competitors such as Nomura and Rothschild had avoided the levy or paid only trivial amounts due to the timing of their annual bonus payouts. The Swiss bank also said the tax conferred an advantage to untaxed banks that amounted to state aid that had not been cleared with the European Commission.  HM Revenue & Customs argued that the tax was imposed fairly and there was no state aid. It also claimed it was always open to a bank not to award any banker bonuses during the period covered by the tax. Credit Suisse’s decision to bring the suit drew anger last month from John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor. He said the lawsuit was “outrageous” and that the bank “should pay these taxes” because people “want the rich to shoulder their fair share of responsibilities”.  On Friday High Court judge Sarah Falk dismissed Credit Suisse’s claim and found in favour of HMRC. She noted that Credit Suisse had produced no witness evidence and that the court only had limited information about the bonuses paid by other banks during the same period.  “In the case of the untaxed banks, Credit Suisse are asking the court to draw inferences from the amounts of bonuses shown in those banks’ accounts and the levels of BPT paid by them without . . . any clear confirmation that the bonuses were discretionary in nature or were of the requisite size to have been caught by BPT,” Mrs Justice Falk ruled. Credit Suisse on Friday said it had “proceeded with this case as we believed there was an important principle of law at stake; however, we accept the judgment of the court”. HMRC said: “We are very pleased with the court’s decision. This confirms our understanding of the rules and protects tax lawfully collected in 2010.”","19.07.2019"
"Credit Suisse: peer sneer","The Swiss bank beat expectations — but not by much","Tidjane Thiam was revelling in the difficulties of Wall Street banks as he unveiled Credit Suisse’s first-quarter results. These were better than the figures spat out earlier this month by some US rivals. One wallow in the woes of others does not make a summer, however. The Swiss bank beat expectations, but not by much. Profits before tax of SFr1.1bn for the period were 7 per cent ahead of consensus and up 1 per cent year on year. International Wealth Management, the engine of Mr Thiam’s turnround, increased net revenues by 1 per cent and profits by 8 per cent. Revenues fell 10 per cent, less than expected, at the global markets division, which specialises in securities trading.  Mr Thiam saw this as a vindication of his refusal to cut deeper into the cost base of the investment bank. In Europe, there is fevered debate over just how small an investment bank a universal bank can get away with. It must retain the depth needed to service corporate borrowers and deal-doing entrepreneurs.  A hangover from the collapse of stock markets late last year did less damage to the Credit Suisse equities business than forecast. Net revenues of SFr571m, about a tenth of the group total, fell just 3 per cent. An average of the top US investment banks showed they suffered a 21 per cent fall in equities over the same period. More good news came from Mr Thiam’s pet project, International Trading Solutions. Essentially a way to sell profitable derivatives to financially sophisticated billionaires, ITS increased net revenues by well over a fifth year on year. This unit contributed to a good performance at IWM. Credit Suisse does not reveal the amount ITS contributes, which suggests it is low. Mr Thiam, who is paid well to deliver, should not get too excited over one quarter of sunshine. The bank had decent results and did not compromise its core tier one capital ratio of 12.6 per cent. For a sobering reality check, investors should note that Credit Suisse shares trade at 0.9 times tangible book value, less than local rival UBS or any of those Wall Street banks.

"Corporate spying: DD gets to write about Diligence (seriously)","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One scoop to start: SoftBank’s Vision Fund is set to plough more money into Greensill Capital, the controversial UK finance company which counts former UK Prime Minister David Cameron as an adviser. Get the full story from DD’s Robert Smith and Arash Massoudi here.  We’re just about ready to declare the theme of this week amateur hour in the corporate espionage industry.   DD readers know (at least we hope that they do) that when a company is considering an acquisition, it performs due diligence — hence the name of our newsletter — to get information on its target.  Sometimes, the corporate intelligence groups that are hired to perform these background checks can unearth mountains of dirty laundry on powerful companies and executives.  The practice has bred an industry that can be used at will, by anyone, to track down and look into people they don’t particularly like or, more often, who owe them money.  There’s often very little on this subject because private investigators tend to be pretty good at their jobs and avoid a crucial faux pas: Being spotted by their mark.  Only when targets find out they are being followed (also known as botched operations) — as with the extraordinary events that have unfolded between Iqbal Khan and his former employer Credit Suisse — do we get some insight into what has happened and how the murky world of corporate investigators operates.  Neil Gerrard, co-head of white collar and securities litigation at Dechert, was kicking back in St Lucia when operatives from Diligence International tried to enter the private island he was staying on. Diligence employees first claimed they were his nephews and then they tried booking a room at the island’s hotel last minute, according to a lawsuit filed in London where Gerrard is suing the company for as much as £100,000 in damages. In both instances they were denied access by local authorities, the document claims, which doesn’t bode well for their careers in the field.  The Dechert lawyer alleges that Diligence, a private investigation firm set up by former intelligence officers, also installed a video camera system on his East Sussex property and followed him at a London restaurant. Even the restaurant manager noticed that the two men were “very interested” in Gerrard. Not quite laying low.  When questioned by police, the Diligence operatives declined to say who had instructed them to surveil Gerrard. The defence to Gerrard’s claim has not yet been filed by Diligence.  The lawyer has been locked in an acrimonious battle with the Kazakh mining company ENRC. He was once brought in to lead an internal ENRC investigation into multiple allegations of wrongdoing in Kazakhstan and Africa, however, the company now accuses him of leaking information to the UK’s Serious Fraud Office — allegations Gerrard denies.  The claim comes as the corporate-intelligence sector has been rocked by separate scandals that have revealed some of the lengths private investigators will go to in order to fulfil their briefs. For Credit Suisse it has become a public-relations nightmare, where a middleman involved in the case has tragically died by suicide, the bank’s number two has resigned, and Zurich’s public prosecutor has launched a probe as to whether any criminal offences were committed.  If you want to go much further on the corporate intelligence industry and its roots in London, we recommend this investigative long-read by the FT’s Tom Burgis. Gambling: Paddy Power owner Flutter has Stars in its eyes When the US Supreme Court lifted its ban on sports gambling in 2018, betting operators around the world rejoiced. Here was a new, large market opening up that could provide a huge windfall.  Industry specialists predicted a wave of consolidation as smaller players teamed up to pursue bigger fortunes.  The dealmaking has been well and truly kicked off by Flutter, the parent company of Paddy Power Betfair and Canada’s Stars Group.   The UK gambling group has agreed to buy the PokerStars parent in an all-share deal that will create the largest online betting operator in the world by revenue.  Flutter shareholders will own 55 per cent of the new company, with Stars shareholders holding the remainder. The cross-border deal will create a UK company worth about £10bn and with annual revenues of £3.8bn. Investors see it as a win-win. Shares in Flutter, an Irish business listed in London, rose 14 per cent before Stars started trading across the Atlantic for a 34 per cent premium in the target stock. The FT’s Lex thinks that sounds about right. The combined entity should benefit from £140m in cost cuts, worth more than £1bn when taxed and capitalised. But don’t bet on it just yet. The deal has to receive regulatory approval, which could be difficult given its large market share in the UK and Australia. France gets short with short-sellers It’s no secret that France doesn’t really like short-sellers.  Activists have had a hard time cracking French companies despite some questionable practices that have been diligently reported by DD’s Robert Smith and Harriet Agnew.  Here’s a refresh on what’s been happening at iconic French retailer Casino and media group Lagardère. Family-owned businesses, of which there are more than a few in France, tend to get better protection because long-term investors are awarded double voting rights under the law.  That makes them difficult targets. But it hasn’t put off activist investors like US-based Muddy Waters and London-based Amber Capital. Both hedge funds have tried to bring Casino and Lagardère, respectively, to account.  Elliott Management is also flexing its activist muscles in France with stakes in drinks maker Pernod Ricard and the engineering consulting group Altran.   Now, a cross-party government commission in France has published recommendations to crack down on short-sellers, in what is seen as an attempt to counteract the flurry of activist activity against some of the country’s best-known companies.  The recommendations call for widening the disclosures of short positions to a number of financial instruments, pushing for more transparency around the borrowing and lending of stock.  It’s probably not much of a surprise that French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, pictured above, suggested earlier this year that France would seek more measures to push back against activists. Muddy Waters, which is currently under investigation by the French markets regulator for market manipulation called it “absurd” and said the country is taking a protectionist view.  Job moves Celeste Guth, who was named Deutsche Bank’s global head of M&A a little over a month ago, has left the bank to join PJT Partners in New York, Bloomberg reported and DD confirmed. Guth, a former partner at Goldman Sachs earlier in her career, will not be replaced at Deutsche.

"Credit Suisse wealth management head leaves after power struggle","Iqbal Khan had grown frustrated with position under CEO Tidjane Thiam","A power struggle at the top of Credit Suisse has resulted in the departure of its head of wealth management after he grew frustrated with his profile and future under chief executive Tidjane Thiam, according to several people with knowledge of the events. The Swiss bank made a surprise announcement late on Monday night that Iqbal Khan was leaving after almost four years leading the wealth management division, which has been the centrepiece and profit-driver of Mr Thiam’s overhaul of the organisation. Mr Khan is in talks to join Julius Baer, the wealth manager that has been poaching teams of bankers from larger rivals UBS and Credit Suisse over the past year, two of the people said. There he would be reunited with new chairman Romeo Lacher, with whom he worked closely at Credit Suisse. However, after choosing to leave Credit Suisse he will have to serve a period of gardening leave before taking any new position. Spokesmen for Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and Mr Khan declined to comment. During his time at Credit Suisse, the ambitious 43-year-old former EY consultant Mr Khan saw his profile rise rapidly as the unit’s performance improved, leading him to wait for assurances from Mr Thiam about his future and role within the organisation, the people said. When none were forthcoming, their relationship soured. “He’s in a rush, wants a huge job and had become a bit frustrated because there’s no room at the top here — Tidjane isn’t going anywhere and he [Mr Khan] wasn’t comfortable in his seat,” said a person familiar with the developments. “He and Tidjane didn’t see eye to eye,” said another person briefed on the circumstances surrounding his departure. “Iqbal is only 43 and Tidjane didn’t like everyone seeing him as the ‘big man’. Obviously that’s come to the boil.” Since Mr Thiam joined in March 2015 the share price has fallen 36 per cent, but has recovered 11 per cent this year as his turnround has gained traction. Mr Khan will be succeeded by Philipp Wehle, the wealth management division’s chief financial officer, who will also join Credit Suisse’s executive board. Mr Wehle has worked at Credit Suisse since 2005, previously leading the lender’s private banking Asia-Pacific finance team. He also serves as co-head of finance for international trading solutions, which aims to better link and cross-sell products between the investment bank and wealth management units. “After six successful years as CFO and later CEO of International Wealth Management (IWM) at Credit Suisse, I decided to pursue the next career move outside [the bank],” Mr Khan said in a statement.","02.07.2019"
"Credit Suisse names former CLSA chairman Tang as China chief","Move follows executive’s abrupt departure in March from Hong Kong-based brokerage","Credit Suisse has appointed Tang Zhenyi as its chief executive for China, where the Swiss bank has recently been moving to expand its business. Mr Tang, who abruptly left Citic-owned CLSA in March as part of a management exodus at the Asia-focused broker, will be based in Beijing. The Swiss bank said in a statement on Monday that Mr Tang would take responsibility for “execution of Credit Suisse’s strategy in China across its business and regulatory activities”, citing his “substantial experience building businesses in China and enhancing connectivity between China and international markets”.  Citic Securities bought Hong Kong-based CLSA in 2013 and Mr Tang later became chairman. Mr Tang’s stint as a senior official at Citic Securities, the securities and investment banking arm of one of China’s largest state-owned conglomerates, followed many years as an official at the country’s ministry of finance.  In March, he was one of several senior executives to leave CLSA amid a culture clash with Citic. Jonathan Slone, CLSA’s longtime chief executive, and Nigel Beattie, chief operating officer, also left the company around the same time. More recently, Christopher Wood, CLSA’s chief strategist, departed to take a job at Jefferies. People familiar with the matter said in March that Citic has struggled to mesh the Wall Street-oriented culture of CLSA with that of Citic, which ultimately takes its direction from the Chinese government. During his time at CLSA, Mr Tang was viewed as more of a western-style banker, despite his background at state-run Citic and China’s finance ministry. Mr Tang will be Credit Suisse’s first China chief executive to be based in Beijing. The last person to hold a similar role was Mervyn Chow, who was greater China chief executive and co-head of Asia Pacific investment banking and capital markets before leaving the bank in 2018 to join private equity group Hillhouse. Credit Suisse has been moving to expand its business in China. In April, it announced it would take majority control of its joint venture securities company, Founder Securities. The bank said it had agreed with Founder to increase its stake in their joint venture to 51 per cent from 33.3 per cent, a previous limit for non-Chinese companies, via a capital injection of about SFr94m ($94m). The increase is still subject to regulatory approval in China. That followed similar investments from rivals including UBS, which won approval from regulators to take a controlling stake in its own joint venture in December.  JPMorgan and Nomura have also secured permission to set up majority controlled JVs, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have said they are considering similar moves. Pressure has built on China’s top leadership to open the country’s markets if they expect reciprocal treatment overseas.  Regulators have vowed to speed up the process, and a year ago set out clearer timeframes for allowing banks, securities companies, asset managers and insurers to take full ownership of their local operations. “We remain committed to enabling the development of wealth and financial markets in China,” said Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse chief executive, in a statement.","03.06.2019"
"Critics round on Credit Suisse for suing UK over bonus tax","Shadow chancellor John McDonnell calls Swiss bank ‘outrageous’ as it kicks off £239m lawsuit","The UK shadow chancellor has branded Credit Suisse “outrageous” after the Swiss bank kicked off a legal battle to claw back £239m of bonus taxes it paid during the financial crisis a decade ago. The Swiss bank is suing HM Revenue & Customs to recover taxes it paid on bonuses for 2009, which were subject to a one-off levy introduced by then Labour chancellor Alistair Darling at a time of widespread anger over bankers’ pay.  Aidan Robertson, Credit Suisse’s barrister, argued in court that the tax was “strikingly unfair” on the Swiss bank and others who paid it, because some of their competitors avoided the levy or paid only trivial amounts due to the timing of their bonus payouts.  He said rivals including Nomura, Rothschild and Royal Bank of Canada avoided the one-off tax because they paid their bonuses outside the 117-day period when it was in effect. The UK’s “bonus tax” ran from December 2009 to April 2010.  Mr Robertson argued that the levy was in breach of EU rules on state aid because some banks managed to avoid the tax while the majority were forced to pay it.  “The [bank payroll tax] penalised us and gave certain competitors a leg-up in the market,” he said.  However, John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, told the Financial Times: “This is outrageous and Credit Suisse should pay these taxes. People in this country want the rich to shoulder their fair share of responsibilities.” The one-off bank payroll tax was introduced by Mr Darling during the depths of the financial crisis and applied a 50 per cent levy on individual bonuses of more than £25,000. The tax was paid by banks rather than individual employees. Credit Suisse cut its bonus pool by 5 per cent to cover the cost of the tax. At the time, Mr Darling said he was introducing the tax because banks were prioritising “substantial bonuses to some already highly paid staff” rather than using profits to “rebuild their financial strength”.  The levy ended up raising far more than Mr Darling had intended — £3.4bn versus initial Treasury projections of £550m. Credit Suisse was also criticised by the High Pay Centre, the UK think-tank, which said the Swiss bank had “failed to read the public mood or just doesn’t care about it”.  “This tax was introduced to help plug funding for public services after revenues from a lightly regulated financial services industry collapsed owing to the sector’s reckless conduct,” said Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre. He added: “It’s surprising that nobody from the Credit Suisse PR team suggested not to publicly demand money back from schools and hospitals.” Credit Suisse said it “considers the 2010 bank payroll tax to have been inherently discriminatory by virtue of an unusually short chargeable period, which meant it was unequally applied to some banks and not others, putting those banks at a competitive disadvantage”. The bank added: “We have been in discussion with HM Revenue & Customs on this point of law for some time, and believe that an important principle is at stake in these proceedings.” HMRC said “We are rigorously defending this claim and seeking to protect tax lawfully collected in 2010.” The trial is expected to last for three days. The case continues. ","25.06.2019"
"Founder Group’s legal spat imperils Credit Suisse move in China","Peking University’s lawsuit over privatisation of group puts bank’s joint venture in doubt","A legal battle between a Beijing-based conglomerate and one of China’s most prestigious universities is threatening Credit Suisse’s plans to take majority control of a securities brokerage connected to the dispute. Peking University has launched a lawsuit against shareholders in Founder Group, alleging that its sale of 65 per cent of the company to three investors 15 years ago was invalid due to fraud and the use of state money to make the purchase. The suit seeks to bring the shares held by the trio — Li You, Wei Xin and Yu Li — back under Peking University’s control. The case has highlighted how legal troubles still haunt the privatisation of state assets carried out more than a decade ago, often under the banner of economic reform. It has also led to concerns over the status of foreign investors that have since bought into those now-private assets. The dispute, which was received by Beijing No 1 Intermediate People’s Court, has raised questions over whether the fight for control over Founder will impede Credit Suisse’s plans to become a majority shareholder in a domestic securities house it owns with Founder Securities. The Swiss bank holds 33.3 per cent of Credit Suisse Founder Securities and said in April that it reached an agreement with Founder Securities to buy up to 51 per cent in the business. Corporate records show that Founder Securities is majority held by Peking University but also includes large shareholdings by the three executives targeted in the lawsuit. Since the Chinese authorities lifted the cap on foreign ownership of securities trading and fund management companies from 49 per cent to 51 per cent last year, many of the world’s biggest banks have been pushing to take full control of their operations in China. The move is particularly important for Credit Suisse, which has made expansion in Asia a key strategy under its chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Credit Suisse would not answer questions regarding the impact of the lawsuit on its business in China or how it would affect the deal for CS Founder Securities.  A Founder Group spokesperson would also not comment on the deal with Credit Suisse. On questions regarding the allegations that Founder shares were improperly transferred 15 years ago, the spokesperson said: “Any illegal or criminal act shall be corrected as soon as possible in accordance with the law.” Mr Li, Mr Wei and Ms Yu could not be reached for comment. The allegations are contested. Earlier this year Ms Yu told Economic Observer that she disagreed with Peking University’s depiction of how the original deal took place. The case was first reported by respected Chinese newspaper Economic Observer and was confirmed by Founder. The potential to roll back a state privatisation that happened a decade and a half ago has led finance experts in the country to question how many other such cases could arise. “One of the reasons this case has attracted so much attention was the prolonged duration since the incident,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in Beijing. “It has been a very long time since Founder’s mixed ownership and restructuring.” Founder was started by Peking University in 1986 as a university-controlled computer technologies developer. A 65 per cent stake in the company was sold to the three Founder executives in 2004, a move considered a big privatisation of a state asset.  Since then it has grown into a conglomerate with businesses ranging from internet technology and real estate to healthcare and finance. In 2016, Mr Li was convicted of insider trading, according to Chinese media reports. But the executives still hold large shares in the company, corporate records show. The lawsuit alleges that the sale of shares in Founder in 2004 to the three businesspeople was paid for with Founder money, indicating a pilfering of state assets, according to Economic Observer. It also alleges that fraudulent financial documents were used in the transaction.

"Credit Suisse sues UK to claw back banker bonus tax payments","Zurich-based bank seeks £239m bank payroll levy it paid after the financial crisis","Credit Suisse is suing the UK tax authorities to recover millions of pounds it paid during the former Labour government’s drive to tax bankers’ bonuses, according to one person briefed on the bank’s actions. The Zurich-based investment bank is seeking to claw back at least £239m, which it paid to HM Revenue & Customs for a temporary fee on bonuses introduced in 2010, the person said. The temporary levy was introduced by then chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling as a way to boost his department’s finances following the financial crisis which led to popular anger over bankers’ bonuses. Set out with an original target of £550m, the levy raised £3.4bn during the four months that it was in place through a 50 per cent levy on individual bonuses paid above £25,000. The tax was on the banks rather than on individual bankers. Credit Suisse has criticised the levy — which was called bank payroll tax — as unfair because it only punished bankers whose bonus payouts were awarded between December 2009 and April 2010, according to the person briefed on the bank’s plans. which were first reported by the Sunday Times.  The Sunday Times cited court documents in which the investment bank alleged the levy was applied unlawfully, arguing it was against European Union rules. Credit Suisse’s claims are for damages to make up for the loss and the amount of tax the bank paid. At the time the Swiss bank reduced the pool for bonuses for 400 bankers based in the UK by a third to source funds to pay for the bill as it sought to prevent the rest of its employees from footing the bill. The case over the tax, which HMRC said was self-assessed, is set to be head in the High Court in late June. It comes amid concerns among some bankers that a Jeremy Corbyn government would lead to similar measures targeting the wealthy. Some business people have already moved their money offshore over their fears of a government led by Mr Corbyn, who has been in favour of higher corporate tax and increased income tax for top earners.

"Lagarde’s IMF departure leaves door open for Thiam","Credit Suisse boss has not said he wants the job, but that hasn’t squashed the rumours","Tidjane Thiam: IMF bail-out
 Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam has been the talk of the town again, after Christine Lagarde’s likely departure from the IMF to head the ECB leaves vacant one of the roles that the Franco-Ivorian financier has long been linked with. Thiam has never spoken publicly about his interest in the job. But friends say he would be an ideal choice, enabling the IMF to make a switch to an emerging markets nominee that could still be palatable to France. (French nationals have held the managing director role five out of 11 times since its post-war foundation). Rumours that Thiam has discussed the issue with French president Emmanuel Macron are disputed. But the advice was allegedly to focus on the role next time round, not now. At least that’ll give TT time to boost the CS share price, after years of stagnation. Paul Donovan: page turner
 It’s been a month since UBS economist Paul Donovan agreed to go on leave after causing a near-diplomatic incident with China over “Swinegate”. A note about the economic impact of China’s swine flu epidemic, including an innocent quip about it being an unpleasant experience for Chinese pigs, went viral on Twitter after being translated and misconstrued. UBS and Donovan were accused of being “distasteful and racist”. Thankfully for the bank, which was frozen out of some business in the aftermath, and for Donovan, whose future at the bank looked uncertain, things have quietened down. Despite the free leave, the quirky economist hasn’t been idle. Friends say he’s picked up the pace on a book he’d been working on about the economics of prejudice. It’s a topic he’s written on before. “Any form of prejudice is bad for the economy,” he wrote last year in a UBS report titled “Pride and Prejudice, and Economists”, covering racial, gender and . . . disability issues. The anti-prejudice cause rather negates the idea of Chinese tweeters’ that Donovan is a racist bigot. Still, turning his open-ended absence into a few months of book leave could be an elegant way to ensure the tension dissipates fully. Then everyone can turn the page. John Dye: do or die
 Amanda Blanc’s departure from Zurich insurance last week left the Association of British Insurers with a headache. Blanc was the chair of the trade body, but had to step down as she was no longer working as a chief exec in the industry. Next into the ABI hotseat is John Dye, head of Allianz’s UK business. The German insurer is obviously keen to make a big splash in the UK. It has already bought businesses from LV and Legal & General this year. Now it’s managed to make its local CEO the figurehead for UK insurers. He’ll only serve a year as ABI chair, rather than the usual two. Watch out for what he does after that though — not one of the past five ABI chairs is still working as an executive in the insurance industry.  Christian Sewing: stylish cut
 Deutsche Bank chief exec Christian Sewing is well known as a details guy. So much so that he made personal phone calls to two London bankers this week. Not on this occasion to praise them on their spreadsheets or quiz them on their models, but to ball them out for their crassness. The pair had organised for personal tailors to visit them at their desks at the London Wall HQ on the same day that the first few hundred staff were told they’d be among the 18,000 being cut in the great purge. Will they get fired, too? “I’m sure that the two colleagues won’t forget my call,” Sewing told Handelsblatt. Daily newsletter

"Vatican spent over a year examining Angolan oil investment","Custodian of donations to Church was approached by businessman with links to senior cardinal","The Vatican’s powerful central administration office spent more than a year researching a $200m investment into an Angolan oil company in a deal proposed by a personal contact of a senior Cardinal, raising fresh questions about the oversight of funds administered by the Catholic Church. The Vatican Secretariat of State, custodian of charitable donations made to the Church by Catholics around the world, used external consultants in 2012 to conduct due diligence into lending funds it held in Swiss bank accounts to Falcon Oil, an Angolan oil company owned by the businessman Antonio Mosquito, people with direct knowledge of the proposal said. After deciding against the loan to Falcon Oil, the Secretariat instead decided to invest the $200m with a London-based Italian financier to buy a minority stake in a building he already owned in London’s exclusive Chelsea. That London property deal has become subject of a Vatican investigation in which Vatican police seized documents and computers from the offices of the Secretariat.
 The Vatican has declined to comment on the focus of its investigation and the suspension of five officials, saying only it was examining past financial transactions conducted by the Secretariat. Mr Mosquito directly approached the Vatican about the $200m investment, a senior Holy See official said. The Angolan businessman had an existing relationship with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu dating back to when he served as the Vatican’s ambassador to Angola from 2001 to 2009.  Falcon Oil and Mr Mosquito did not respond to a request for comment.  Until 2018 Cardinal Becciu was the second-highest ranking official in the Secretariat of State reporting directly to both Pope Benedict and later Pope Francis. He personally authorised the London real estate investment, people directly involved said. At the time that the Secretariat was considering the investment, Angola was led by President José Eduardo dos Santos. Until he stepped down in 2017, Africa’s second-largest crude producer had developed a reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, with few investors entering Angola. The country sits near the bottom of Transparency International’s index of corruption perceptions, ranking 165 out of 180 countries. Alberto Perlasca, a former senior official in the Secretariat’s Office of Administration at the time of the proposal, who this year was moved by Pope Francis to serve on the Church’s highest court, told the Financial Times the Secretariat was approached directly by Mr Mosquito about the Angolan oil opportunity. Mr Perlasca was responding to questions directed to Cardinal Becciu’s office on his behalf. “Mr Mosquito contacted the Secretariat of State as anyone else could have easily done,” Mr Perlasca said in an emailed response to questions from the Financial Times. “The fact that nothing was done about it shows that the Secretariat of State has been scrupulous in the examination of the investment beyond every consideration of person or of friendship.” Mr Perlasca did not directly respond to questions about why a $200m loan to an Angolan oil platform was considered a suitable possible investment for the Secretariat, which is the custodian of hundreds of millions of dollars of charity money donated to the Catholic Church by the faithful. In 2012 Falcon Oil held a 5 per cent stake in the Angolan offshore exploration block 15/06, whose largest shareholders were and still are Italy’s ENI and the Angolan state company Sonangol. Falcon was seeking the $200m loan to finance its contribution to the construction of an offshore platform. Angola’s offshore oilfields have been difficult to exploit as the country has battled to turn round a decline in reserves. Drilling mostly came to a halt after the 2014 oil price slump. Mr Perlasca added that “Cardinal Becciu had met Mr Mosquito in Angola. Note well: it was Mr Mosquito who contacted the Secretariat of State, and not the Secretariat of State who contacted Mr Mosquito.”  “The investment about oil was not considered attractive, unless one considers it a bit further in consideration of the novelty of the proposal,” Mr Perlasca said. “But to take something under consideration does not seem to me to be a fault.” Cardinal Becciu declined to respond directly to the FT’s questions. Raffaele Mincione, the London-based Italian financier whose company managed the Secretariat’s investment in the building in Chelsea, said that in 2012 he had been asked by the Secretariat to perform extensive due diligence on the Angolan oil proposal. “Credit Suisse, on behalf of the Holy See, asked WRM to perform due diligence on the potential investment with the objective to invest $200m in this venture,” it said. “Our due diligence was extensive and . . . lead us to recommend to Credit Suisse and the Holy See not to pursue this investment.”  Credit Suisse declined to comment. Credit Suisse was acting as the private banker for the Secretariat, and its adviser for its investments.  WRM has said it has no direct knowledge of the Vatican investigation into the Secretariat’s investment into its London property, and is confident that it has committed no wrongdoing.

"Credit Suisse singled out over ‘weakness’ in Fed stress test","Swiss bank banned from increasing payments to parent company","The US Federal Reserve has demanded Credit Suisse fix “weaknesses” in its capital plans before it will allow the US arm of the bank to increase payments to its parent in Switzerland, following annual stress tests that otherwise painted a healthy picture of the industry. The Swiss bank is the only major bank to have to submit a revised capital plan before being allowed to make its requested payouts. While it was the best capitalised bank in the stress test, officials said they were not happy with the way it forecast what its trading losses might be in a severe downturn. In contrast, Deutsche Bank, the troubled German bank which failed last year’s test, passed without further question this year, along with all 16 other major institutions — even though the Fed’s test this year made tougher assumptions about a severe economic downturn than it did 12 months ago.  Randal Quarles, the vice-chair of the Fed, said: “The stress tests have confirmed that the largest banks are both well-capitalised and place a high priority on strong capital planning practices. The results show that these firms and our financial system are resilient in normal times and under stress.”  Eric Varvel, chief executive of Credit Suisse USA, said: “We acknowledge the concerns relayed by the Fed and fully expect to remediate the issues by the October deadline given.” The results mean that large US-listed banks will now be able to make higher dividend payouts and share buybacks. Bank of America, for example, said it would increase its dividend by 20 per cent, while Citigroup said it would raise its payout by 11 per cent. According to an analysis by RBC Capital Markets, banks are planning to pay out $190bn to shareholders in the next year, up 17 per cent on the previous year. Gerard Cassidy, a research analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The big banks are making larger payouts than expected. Dividends are up, buybacks are up, and the banks are all well capitalised.” The results show that US regulators are more comfortable with the health of the US banking system than they were a year ago, when Deutsche failed and two other banks — Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — were required to submit updated plans. State Street was also required to adjust its plans for how it manages risk under stress last year. This year, two banks — JPMorgan and Capital One — had to resubmit their plans shortly before the deadline before being judged to have passed. Both banks only narrowly cleared the Fed’s required minimum for what they judged their capital ratio would be under a severe downturn, after accounting for payouts to shareholders.  Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said: “We are pleased to have the capacity and flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders as we maintain a fortress balance sheet that provides the ability to withstand extreme stress.” Capital One said it would maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.40 a share.  The Fed said that since the first round of stress tests in 2009, the largest and most complex banks had doubled their common equity capital — a measure of financial health — from about $300bn in total to about $800bn.  Those results meant that Deutsche Bank, which is the subject of several investigations in the US, will now be able to make planned payments back to its Frankfurt headquarters. The Fed has separately asked for more details, however, on Deutsche’s plans to create a “bad bank”, which could involve shrinking or closing many of its US operations. A senior Fed official said Deutsche Bank had stepped up efforts to address the regulatory and supervisory issues facing its US division, but the central bank was still monitoring its progress. Regulators will now give Credit Suisse four months to address the weaknesses they identified in the stress test, during which time the bank will only be able to make the same level of payouts to its parent it was authorised to do last year.","27.06.2019"
"Former Credit Suisse banker pleads guilty on Mozambique bribes","Detelina Subeva faced charge in US of conspiracy to help launder money","A former Credit Suisse banker has pleaded guilty in the US over handling alleged kickbacks in Mozambique’s $2bn “tuna bond” scandal. Detelina Subeva, a former vice-president at the Swiss bank’s global financing unit, entered the guilty plea on a charge of conspiracy to help launder money before a New York court on Monday. Ms Subeva is one of three former Credit Suisse employees whom US prosecutors have indicted over an alleged scheme to loot at least $200m from loans that the bank helped arrange in 2013 for the southern African nation, one of the world’s poorest. The prosecutors accused the trio of working with Mozambique’s former finance minister and a representative of Privinvest, an Abu Dhabi-based shipbuilder, to siphon bribes connected to the debt. The loans imploded not long after being sold on to global investors. Ms Subeva, 37, told the court that she had received funds from a $1m kickback that another of the trio, Andrew Pearse, allegedly received from Privinvest. The US dropped other charges against Ms Subeva. Ms Subeva’s lawyer in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US has detained Jean Boustani, the Privinvest employee. It is also seeking to extradite Mozambique’s former finance minister Manuel Chang as well as the former bankers — Mr Pearse, 49, former head of the global financing group who went on to work with Privinvest, and Surjan Singh, 44, a former managing director at the bank. The three are fighting extradition. Credit Suisse has said that its employees flouted due diligence rules and concealed communications from the bank. Ms Subeva’s guilty plea comes as 1,000 signatories from Mozambique urged the UK government to undertake a full investigation of the role of Credit Suisse and VTB in the scandal. The signatories, drawn from civil society, are dismayed by what they see as inaction by the part of the UK authorities in holding the banks to account. The loans to state-owned companies were sold to investors as having helped Mozambique to create a tuna fishery and maritime security projects.  The funds raised were channelled through Privinvest, which had contracts to supply equipment connected to the loans. However, about $1.4bn of the debt was concealed from the IMF and donors to Mozambique.  Donors cut funds to Mozambique’s government after the hidden debt was revealed in 2016 and Mozambique entered a deep financial crisis, including defaults on the loans. According to US prosecutors, the bankers fabricated the rationale even on the one publicly issued bond for the tuna fishery, which was later turned into fully fledged government debt. Mozambique has reached an agreement in principle with creditors on debt relief for the former tuna bond, and is close to a similar deal with VTB on a loan that the Russian bank arranged. But President Filipe Nyusi’s government is under pressure from the opposition and civil society groups at home to repudiate all of the loans outright over evidence of criminality. Mozambique has sued Credit Suisse, Ms Subeva and the two other ex-bankers in a London court in an attempt to cancel the state guarantee on the previously hidden loan arranged by the bank. Privinvest, which is not a defendant in the US case, has always denied wrongdoing over the loans. Lawyers for Mr Pearse and Mr Singh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","21.05.2019"
"The Swiss bank tries to move on but Spygate keeps getting worse","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Tidjane Thiam (pictured below) probably never thought that a bust-up with his neighbour over trees would turn into the biggest threat to his tenure as chief executive of Credit Suisse. But that is exactly what has happened over the past few weeks.  The Swiss bank on Tuesday tried to draw a line under the extraordinary spying scandal that has riveted Zurich and the financial industry.  A brief investigation into the espionage episode, which involved the bank’s decision to track its former head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan, has concluded that the operation was set up by Pierre-Olivier Bouée (pictured below) without Thiam’s knowledge. Bouée, the bank’s chief operating officer and a longtime associate of Thiam’s, departed to take the blame for the saga. Unfortunately, the news of his exit was overshadowed by the revelation that the consultant, who acted as a middle man between Credit Suisse and a private investigation firm, died by suicide. Read the FT’s latest report on the situation here to catch up.  The lurid affair has raised doubts over whether Thiam could survive the incident. Whether Thiam did or didn’t know about the fact that Credit Suisse had hired a private investigation firm to spy on Khan, a banker he recruited to help build out the asset management arm, seems almost irrelevant at this point.  DD readers will remember that Khan and Thiam shared a fence in Lake Zurich’s luxurious “Gold Coast” known for its low taxes and high house prices.  If Thiam didn’t know, he should’ve (he runs the bank!) and if he did know, well . . .  Credit Suisse’s chairman Urs Rohner has backed Thiam. “We strongly reject any assertions that call into question the integrity of our CEO,” he said in a hastily prepared press conference.  An independent investigation by the law firm Homburger concluded that Bouée had acted alone in ordering the surveillance on Khan on fears that he was going to poach Credit Suisse employees and clients to bolster the fortunes of his new employer UBS. Presumably this would’ve all stayed behind closed doors if Khan hadn’t spotted the spy while out with his wife in Zurich. But the information is now public (and sprawled all over Swiss dailies) and there are questions that still haven’t been answered.  The FT’s Lex column asks why Khan was able to take a top job at larger rival UBS just three months after quitting his job at Credit Suisse. Surely there should’ve been the standard notice or gardening period, which for some senior executives can be as long as a year? Rohner took the hit for that one.  Credit Suisse’s attempt to keep tabs on its former employee is distasteful at best. Wealth managers are held to higher standards of professional and personal conduct than those in almost every other field. The affair has managed to cast a negative light on the bank and might see some clients willingly defect.  Just in time for Khan who started his new role at UBS this week. As for Thiam, he has received a strong public backing from his board. But with Credit Suisse shares down more than 40 per cent since he started in the role back in July 2015, DD is left to wonder whether this incident will kick start further changes to the bank’s leadership over the next 12 months.  Leo Strine has some parting words for corporate America  Since he became chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court in 2014, no judge has loomed larger over corporate America and its dealmakers than Leo Strine (pictured above). The man who has presided over the domicile of more than half of all publicly traded US companies is about to step down, but not without a parting shot.  In a proposal called “Toward Fair and Sustainable Capitalism”, which he summarises in this column for the FT, Strine calls for big companies to create board committees focused on employees’ interests, for asset managers to consider their beneficiaries’ “human interests”, and for the holding period for “long-term” capital gains to be changed from one year to five. In an interview with Moral Money, Strine hailed the benefit corporation model, saying it requires companies “to give regard to their stakeholders, even when they engage in a sale or a merger”.  Hedge fund managers, activist investors and private equity executives should also take note: Strine is taking aim at “tax and accounting rules that encourage speculation and rapid portfolio turnover.”  Specifically, he is proposing a financial transactions tax of 0.5 per cent for equity securities, 0.1 per cent for bonds, and 0.005 per cent for derivatives, plus capital gains tax reform and the elimination of the “carried interest” tax loophole.  If all this sounds like a future candidate’s policy manifesto, the self-styled New Deal liberal insists that he isn't warming up for a political career.  “I’m definitely not planning to run for office,” Strine told Moral Money: “If I can help my society, I’ll always try to step up to the plate. But my biggest dream pretty much these days is of a nap.” Freshfields partner reckons with sexual misconduct allegations The #MeToo movement has swept through elite London law firms this year with reported claims of sexual misconduct near record highs.    
  Among them is Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer partner Ryan Beckwith, who is alleged to have attempted to kiss and later initiated “sexual activity” with a junior colleague. Beckwith’s hearing in front of the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal started on Monday with details about the law firm’s heavy drinking culture. Partners frequently set up bar tabs for more junior staff, according to the testimony. The female lawyer, who remains anonymous and is referred to as Person A, told the tribunal on Tuesday that she had not been “brave enough”, “strong enough or senior enough” to raise the issue before quitting the firm. She reported two separate incidents involving Beckwith: one where he had kissed her and one where he had allegedly followed her home after a night out and engaged in sexual activity while the junior lawyer was “extremely and exceptionally drunk” and had trouble standing up.  The 41-year-old partner in the restructuring team has called Person A’s account a “complete fabrication” and said that the sexual activity was consensual. If findings are made against him, Beckwith could be struck off but the SDT will not deal with matters of consent.  The tribunal is the most recent incident to grip big law as the Solicitors Regulation Authority puts sexual misconduct cases, once seen as outside of its remit, at the forefront of its agenda.

"Credit Suisse trading rebound eases pressure on Tidjane Thiam","First-quarter profits jump 8% as wealth management unit continues to grow","Credit Suisse reported an 8 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit, beating estimates, as its wealth management unit continued to grow and it reversed the decline in its securities trading business. The Swiss lender’s previously struggling global markets division made a SFr282m ($277m) pre-tax profit in the period, exceeding analysts’ expectations and recovering from the SFr289m it lost in the second half of last year.  Credit Suisse outperformed its bigger rivals on Wall Street, reporting only a 10 per cent year-on-year decline in trading revenue — or half that on a Swiss-franc basis — compared with an average 14 per drop at US banks.  “Our outperformance of peers . . . on the basis of the US banks that have reported so far is quite material, which I think in English means ‘quite a lot’,” said chief financial officer David Mathers. Andrew Coombs, a Citigroup analyst, said: “We view these as decent results. Global markets has been the main cause of earnings downgrades over the past year and has now shown signs of stabilising.” He also noted the Asia-Pacific trading unit eked out a small profit after consistently losing money for the past two years. Profit at the group’s flagship wealth management unit also jumped 8 per cent as the bank attracted SFr9.6bn of net new assets, increasing the total under management to a record SFr786bn. The shares lost early gains to trade up slightly at SFr13.52. The performance defied dire predictions by some observers and eased some of the pressure on chief executive Tidjane Thiam, for whom trading had been the most persistent problem despite his swingeing cuts to the expensive and volatile division. Analysts had forecast on average European investment banks’ revenue would drop about a quarter. Mr Thiam’s crosstown rival, UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti, warned last month his investment bank had one of its worst starts to a year in recent history with revenues dropping about a third. UBS reports on Thursday. “The positive momentum we observed towards the end of the first quarter has broadly continued in April,” said Mr Thiam.  The improvement in its global markets unit was credited to the bank’s focus on fixed-income trading, which generally fared better in the quarter, and an improved performance in equities, where it has been investing and hiring. However, overall revenue at the investment banking division fell 12 per cent, largely because advisory and capital markets division swung to a pre-tax loss of SFr93m after revenue slumped by a third.  The bank blamed the drop-off in M&A, bond and equity underwriting on “the US government shutdown, investor concerns over reduced growth in corporate earnings and GDP as well as the uncertain geopolitical environment”. “We are really not here saying all is good. I am still worried, absolutely, it’s very difficult to manage in an environment like this,” Mr Thiam said.  Still, the largely positive results add momentum to Mr Thiam’s often stop-start turnround of Credit Suisse. The 162-year-old Swiss lender returned to profit last year, ending a three-year lossmaking streak during which it made SFr6.7bn of losses as it unwound risky leveraged trading positions, cut more than 10,000 jobs and paid big misconduct fines around the world.  Credit Suisse’s net profits climbed 8 per cent to SFr749m, beating analysts’ expectations for SFr676m. Earnings were helped by a 6 per cent decline in operating costs to SFr4.2bn. While UBS is in talks to merge its asset management arm with that of Deutsche Bank, Mr Thiam said he had no desire to join the rush into dealmaking expected this year across the European banking sector. “Our appetite for the acquisition of a eurozone bank is limited, we just don’t think it is the best use of our capital,” Mr Thiam said. “We have more attractive investment opportunities across Switzerland and abroad . . . and that makes the bar very high.” Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank are nearing the endgame of their merger talks with rival suitors UniCredit and ING lurking in the wings. Credit Suisse’s common equity tier one ratio — a key benchmark of balance sheet strength — remained stable at 12.6 per cent, reassuring investors the bank will be able to deliver its promised SFr1bn of stock buybacks this year. Indeed, Citi analysts boosted their repurchase estimate to SFr1.5bn. However, the lender made a return on tangible equity of 8 per cent in the quarter, still shy of its target for 10 to 11 per cent for this year, meaning executives need to improve revenue and cut costs to achieve that goal. Shares in the bank have risen almost a third this year ahead of its annual meeting on Friday.","24.04.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Metro Bank, Paddy Power, Evraz, Carnival, BHP","Bunzl’s outsized margins look unsustainable, says Credit Suisse","Thursday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● Metro Bank dropped to a record low after its first-quarter earnings came in well below forecasts because of a sharp deterioration in net interest margins.  Underlying profit of £6.9m was down 39 per cent quarter on quarter, costs were up 3 per cent sequentially and deposits were reduced by 4 per cent on reputational damage following its January profit warning. For the full year, Metro warned that deposit growth would be “materially lower” than its previous 20 per cent target but left 2020 guidance unchanged. “Given the weak profit outlook we see a further equity injection in 2020 as highly likely,” said Barclays. It estimated that pre-update consensus forecasts for Metro were between 40 and 50 per cent too high.  ● Paddy Power Betfair led the FTSE 100 fallers after its first-quarter update showed the effects of adverse sports results and measures to tackle problem gambling.  Net revenue growth for the quarter was up 17 per cent to £478m, missing expectations by about £10m due largely to growth from online unexpectedly stalling and retail takings turning negative. Management said April trading had been in line with its expectations and left 2019 profit expectations unchanged. Post the introduction of a £2 maximum stake on roulette machines, Paddy Power’s high-street business had been trading towards the lower end of expectations, said Morgan Stanley. That had “a potentially negative read-across for William Hill, which has the same supplier, and potentially GVC”. Citigroup highlighted “relatively limited recycling” of customer winnings and noted that enhancing responsible-gambling measures would have an impact on Paddy Power’s higher-value customer revenues. Regulatory headwinds and weak earnings momentum stemming from a lack of growth from the group’s Betfair exchange made the stock a “sell”, it said. Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs downgraded Evraz to “sell” from “neutral” with a 550p target price.  A 31 per cent rally over the past three months has outpaced both the 10 per cent gain for Russian peers and the flat performance for global steelmakers, leaving Evraz’s valuation looking stretched, said Goldman. The broker also argued that Evraz had decoupled from key commodity prices, which based on its revenue sources were up just 9 per cent in the past three months.  Yet Evraz was likely to deliver much weaker free cash flow than peers this year given tough macro conditions in combination with its rising capital expenditure, Goldman said. A free cash valuation premium to historical levels of 19 per cent, against a sector trading at a 10 per cent discount, made Evraz too expensive heading into its July half-year update, it said. ● Credit Suisse downgraded Bunzl, the disposables distributor, to “underperform” from “neutral” with a £21 target. “We think the combination of limited organic growth and falling underlying margins more than offsets the ongoing opportunity to grow the business via mergers and acquisitions,” it said. “Bunzl makes substantially higher returns than either its clients’ industries or the producers of the raw materials within the products it distributes. To an extent this reflects that Bunzl is a relatively asset-light business, particularly when compared to the asset heavy retail client base and raw material producers, and this innate difference will not change. It does, however, indicate that Bunzl is commanding an above-average portion of the value in this supply chain. That leaves it vulnerable, in our view, to further pressure on margins.”Credit Suisse ● In brief: Air France-KLM rated new “neutral” at Citigroup; Almirall raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Atos raised to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; BHP cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Carnival rated new “outperform” at Macquarie; Ceconomy upgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Gima TT raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Hostelworld rated new “buy” at Shore Capital; Intesa downgraded to “sell” at Berenberg; Jupiter Fund Management cut to “sell” at UBS; Kone cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Morses Club cut to “hold” at Shore Capital; Nucleus Financial rated new “outperform” at Macquarie; Safestore downgraded to “hold” at Stifel; Wolters Kluwer cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays.

"Credit Suisse shareholders urged to vote against pay policy","Proxy adviser Glass Lewis attacks Tidjane Thiam’s ‘unjustified’ bonus increase","Credit Suisse is facing the threat of investor dissent after proxy adviser Glass Lewis urged shareholders to vote down the bank’s pay policy because of an “unjustified CEO bonus increase” for Tidjane Thiam.  The bank gave its chief executive a 30 per cent pay rise to SFr12.7m ($12.7m) last year despite a 38 per cent plunge in its stock, partly because his potential short-term bonus as a proportion of his base salary was increased to 1.83 times from 1.5. Credit Suisse said the pay rise was justified because Mr Thiam had taken voluntary reductions in the previous two years and returned the bank to profit after a three-year lossmaking streak. The increase is backed by Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis’s larger peer. “We are once again troubled by the board’s immediate exercise of upward discretion in increasing the CEO’s short-term incentive opportunity for the past fiscal year, which appears as an unnecessary anticipation of a reward for potential future results,” Glass Lewis said. “We are [also] troubled by the level of the CEO’s base salary, which seems to significantly exceed that of his peers.” ISS, which has a bigger following among Credit Suisse’s investor base, counselled shareholders to vote in favour of the compensation report because the bank provided a justification for pay increases, fixed pay levels remained roughly stable and it has provided more transparent disclosures in recent years. Pay has been a sensitive issue for the bank since it faced investor revolts for boosting bonuses in 2016 and 2017 despite making more than SFr3bn in annual losses during that period. To appease shareholders, executives including Mr Thiam took voluntary 40 per cent reductions to their bonuses over those two years, which have now been removed. Both Glass Lewis and ISS advised shareholders to vote in favour of all other aspects of the Zurich-based lender’s 2018 report, which will be presented at its annual meeting on April 26. “We take note of the recommendations put forward,” the bank said in response to both reports. “Credit Suisse respects shareholder democracy.”","08.04.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Investec, Rolls-Royce, Petropavlovsk
, Prada, Enel","Virgin Media is holding back Liberty’s acquisition firepower, says Citi","Friday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Investec led the FTSE 250 fallers after warning of tough trading conditions at its UK investment bank. Interim adjusted earnings per share would be between 4 and 7 per cent lower than last year because of a sharp downturn for the UK specialist banking business. “Market variability and persistent uncertainty relating to Brexit and global trade wars has negatively impacted investment banking fees and trading income,” Investec said. “Furthermore, interest income has been impacted by the additional liquidity required to pre-fund the exit of Irish deposits as a result of Brexit.” ● Rolls-Royce edged lower after the jet engine maker gave an update on problems with its Trent 1000 turbine, which has been blighted by resilience issues. A previous target of reaching single-digit grounded aircraft by the year end was pushed back to the second quarter of 2020. Rolls’ update comes after blade failure on a Norwegian Airlines-operated Boeing 787 last month scattered debris on to a Rome suburb. “Since then, we perceived a risk that further action would be required, potentially leading to higher costs being incurred. In that sense, today’s announcement that guidance for the Trent 1000 cash costs in 2019 and 2020 remains unchanged comes as a relief to us,” said Jefferies. ● Signify, the Amsterdam-listed lighting maker, retreated after parent company Philips began the sale of its remaining 10.7 per cent stake. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse upgraded Burberry from “neutral” to “outperform” and made the opposite call on Prada in a European luxury sector review. Its analysis drew in econd-hand resale values and a “heat index, capturing consumer engagement across Instagram, WeChat, Baidu and Google.” A likely slowdown in luxury goods demand across most major nationalities raises the profile of turnround stocks such as Burberry, Prada, Ferragamo and Tod’s, Credit Suisse said. But LVMH and Kering’s Gucci brand “have raised the bar in terms of product innovation and communication initiatives meaning that turnaround strategies are more difficult and most costly to execute”, it said. “We believe Burberry is the most appealing turnaround story in the luxury space. We see early signs that brand heat is rising following the arrival of the new collections and sound execution with the appointment of high-profile senior luxury executives in the last two years.”Credit Suisse New collections will account for the majority of Burberry’s sales from the second quarter 2020 so like-for-like sales growth can accelerate to 6 per cent from 4 per cent in the first quarter, Credit Suisse estimated. Yet at 22 times current year earnings Burberry was trading at a discount to the sector average of 23 times, which “is unwarranted at this stage of the brand cycle”. On Prada, Credit Suisse said: “The lack of change within the management [and] creative teams, a negative brand momentum of late and the distribution upgrade will likely weigh on both near-term sales and margins.” A valuation of 35 times current year earnings also “looks vulnerable”, it added. Ferragamo and Tod’s were repeated “underweight” based on a perceived lack of scale and a lack of brand heat improvement. The company founders “appear unwilling to sacrifice near-term margin to support a brand relaunch, leading to further market shares losses and gradual margin erosion”, it said. ● Citigroup downgraded Liberty Global 
from “buy” to “sell” with a $25 target price. It cited growth worries around UK arm Virgin Media, which provides about 60 per cent of Liberty’s valuation. An implied value on Virgin of just 7 times earnings “is warranted  . . . given the saturated UK broadband market, aggressive pricing environment, infrastructure competition and Brexit/foreign exchange risks”. The legacy cable TV business is in decline yet still provides 95 per cent of operating cash flow and, while some growth is coming from ultrafast broadband, the rollout requires substantial capital expenditure, Citi said. The broker added that Virgin’s lack of an owned mobile network made its convergence strategy “unsustainable in the long term”. Liberty’s 25 per cent outperformance against European telecoms peers in the year to date suggests that, once its Swiss network sale completes, investors expect share buybacks of about $4bn, said Citi. “However, we foresee risk of the deal getting blocked or the terms getting amended.” The risks limit Liberty’s firepower to make a “non-urgent” bid for a UK mobile operator or buy Belgian cable operator VOO, Citi added. ● Panmure Gordon started coverage of Petropavlovsk
, the Russian gold miner, with “buy” advice and a 17p target price. The commissioning in late 2018 of a pressure oxidation facility “is the key that unlocks value in the Petropavlovsk portfolio”, Panmure told clients. “The group has about two-thirds of its gold reserves in refractory ores; being able to monetise these via the hub is critical to the Petropavlovsk story. Put very crudely, the hub puts at least ten years’ production life in front of both the Malomir and Pioneer mines.” Falling capital expenditure and cash costs should mean sustained strong free cash flows from 2019 on, Panmure said. “Delivering this level of cash flow means management can consider distributions to investors as well as developing a longer-term strategy for the group — most likely around its refractory ore expertise.” ● Jefferies upgraded Vopak, the Dutch tank storage company, from “hold” to “buy” with a €54 target price. Pending European emissions regulations known as IMO 2020 were increasing storage demand for a wider range of fuel types, it said. The broker also saw higher demand being fed by a market for low-sulphur fuel in contango, meaning futures prices were higher than spot prices. “We think Vopak has rented out most of its fuel oil capacity under multiyear take-or-pay contracts at higher rates from the fourth quarter 2019,” said Jefferies. The multiyear contracts should help smooth over a period of heightened volatility in fuel demand as Vopak prepares for a longer-term shift of bunker supply from Singapore to Chinese ports that are closer to refineries, it said. Earnings per share should grow about 15 per cent a year to 2021, which makes Vopak’s enterprise valuation of 9.4 times 2020 trading profit look “undemanding”, said Jefferies. ● In brief: Alten raised to “buy” at Société Générale; Antofagasta cut to “sell” at UBS; Cegedim cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Derwent London cut to “reduce” at HSBC; Enel raised to “buy” at HSBC; Great Portland cut to “reduce” at HSBC; Hummingbird rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Inwit cut to “neutral” at Macquarie; Learning Tech cut to “hold” at Canaccord; Melrose Industries cut to “sell” at Panmure Gordon; rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Philips rated new “overweight” at Barclays; Ricardo cut to “hold” at Panmure Gordon; Roche raised to “hold” at Société Générale; Sensirion raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Siemens Healthineers rated new “equal-weight” at Barclays.

"Mozambique’s Nyusi wins landslide election victory","President tightens grip on power in polls that opposition branded a ‘mega fraud’","President Filipe Nyusi and his Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo) party have won a landslide victory in the gas-rich southern African nation in an election the opposition branded a “mega fraud”. The stakes were high in presidential, parliamentary and provincial polls marred by violence and overshadowed by the prospect of tens of billions of dollars in gas investment pouring into a country with a per capita income of below $1,000 in nominal terms. French oil group Total is heading a $25bn liquefied natural gas project agreed this year and ExxonMobil is expected to announce its intention to develop a similar-sized project in the next few months. The thumping victory, in which Mr Nyusi won 73 per cent of the vote and the opposition Renamo party failed to win a single of the country’s 10 provinces, will test a peace treaty signed between the two former civil war foes as recently as August.  Going into the election, Renamo had expected to win at least two provinces after a constitutional change that devolved power by allowing provincial governors to be elected directly for the first time. The electoral commission also declared that, in the 250-seat national assembly, Frelimo had won 184 seats against 60 for Renamo and just six for the country’s third force, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique. With more than a two-thirds majority, Frelimo has the power to change the constitution, which limits presidents to two terms in office. Ossufo Momade, the leader of Renamo, last week called the election a “mega fraud” and urged his supporters not to accept the result. His disavowal of the process echoes accusations of electoral fraud this year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi and elsewhere, but is unlikely to prevent President Nyusi from consolidating what had been a fragile grip on power. The campaign was marred by several incidents of violence and claims by election monitors that Frelimo, which has ruled the country since independence in 1975, had abused its incumbent status.  An observer mission sent by the EU said the election had been held in “a climate of fear” in which the ruling party had used state resources to mobilise campaign funds, logistical support and advertising.  The US embassy also reported what it said were several irregularities, including suspicious vote counts.  Weekly podcast

  Listen to the new weekly podcast from Gideon Rachman, the FT’s chief foreign affairs columnist, and listen in on his conversations with the decision makers and thinkers from all over the globe who are shaping world affairs Analysts for Mozambique’s Centre for Public Integrity, a civic watchdog, estimated that hundreds of thousands of votes for Mr Nyusi were faked. Frelimo has a long history of alleged vote-rigging but “this election was different” in the level of co-ordination, said Joe Hanlon, a veteran Mozambique watcher who compiled poll analysis for the watchdog. Frelimo had kept a tight grip on the process through violence and intimidation and “it does put the peace accord at risk,” Mr Hanlon said. Activists had raised the alarm before the polls about thousands of ‘ghost’ voters on the rolls in a Frelimo stronghold region in particular. On the eve of the poll, police were implicated in the shooting of a senior local observer in the southern Gaza province. Mozambique has been seeking to repair its relations with the international community since 2016 when its government revealed that it had secretly borrowed $2bn for a tuna fishing fleet that was never used.  The IMF suspended lending after most of those funds, arranged by Credit Suisse and Russian bank VTB, vanished.  A former Credit Suisse banker has pleaded guilty in the US to handling over some $2m in bribes in relation to the loan.  Mozambique has arrested 20 officials in connection with the alleged fraud, including the son of former president Armando Guebuza. ","27.10.2019"
"UBS spurs rivals to charge wealthy clients negative rates","Swiss banks seek to mitigate pressure on profits from shift in monetary policy","Negative interest rates have claimed their latest victim: the ultra-rich.  It emerged last week that UBS, Switzerland’s largest wealth manager, was planning to levy charges on wealthy clients with substantial pots of cash at the bank. Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse’s chief executive, told reporters that it was also considering charging clients who are holding cash with them in Switzerland to “mitigate [the] pressure” of negative interest rates. The moves come as banks around the world steel themselves for low — and, in some cases, negative — interest rates to be one of the defining features of the financial landscape for longer than expected. The European Central Bank is widely expected to cut its deposit rate from minus 0.4 per cent to minus 0.5 per cent in September — with some predicting it could go even further after that. Swiss interest rates have been at -0.75 since January 2015. Then last week, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in a decade.  UBS believes its move — as the largest wealth manager in the world — is likely to spur competitors to do the same.  Kleinwort Hambros, the UK private bank owned by Société Générale, has been developing the technology required to charge negative interest rates in the event of an influx of clients from competitors — though it currently has no plans to levy negative rates on depositors. Some smaller Swiss banks — including Pictet and Julius Baer — have already been passing on negative interest rates set by the central bank to clients. Lombard Odier plans to charge negative rates on euro deposits over €1m from October for what it says is a small number of clients who do not hold discretionary mandates with the wealth manager. US Federal Reserve cuts rates by 0.25%  So far, banks have largely only passed on these negative interest rates to their corporate and institutional clients. The move to target wealthy individuals comes as bankers complain that their richest clients are holding too much of their portfolios in cash, amid concerns about the outlook for equity markets and the global economy.  Wealthy clients need to get away from a perspective that cash is less risky, says Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management. In a negative interest rate environment, holding assets in cash is an easy way to lose money. And caution on the part of wealthy customers carries another sting for banks. The more clients trade, the more lenders earn in fees, while depositing assets into cash simply costs the bank money. “Negative rates have proved more sticky and endurable than we thought before they were introduced,” says one banker. “Whereas in the past banks have thought this is something we’ll have to mitigate the effects of, they are now under genuine economic pressure to pass the market rates on to their customers.” Some bankers believe that the next steps for banks will be to start penalising customers lower down the wealth curve for holding cash. “The class of clients is going to be surely and slowly increased,” predicts one. The trick will be the balancing act: if they levy charges on retail clients with smaller deposits, they could see withdrawals that would harm their balance sheets.  Others believe banks will not venture that far. “It becomes a political and a social issue if you charge a ‘normal’ person negative interest rates,” says Ronit Ghose, an analyst at Citi. Some view the move by UBS to pass on the cost of central bank policy to private clients as simply a bid to signal to shareholders that they are taking steps as negative rates become more entrenched in Switzerland. On that reading, this is less about clawing back money, rather demonstrating that they are addressing the ongoing threat to their profitability. More than anything, banks are hoping that by passing on negative rates, they will finally incentivise both companies and wealthy people to invest more of their money rather than hoard it. As one analyst puts it: “The ECB are ultimately trying to say to companies and individuals: spend it, go and build that factory or buy that yacht, as that’s what we want for the economy.”","06.08.2019"
"SoftBank and JPMorgan at odds over WeWork rescue","Some deal options could lead to margin calls for co-founder Adam Neumann","SoftBank and JPMorgan Chase are at odds over a multibillion-dollar rescue package for WeWork that might force the US bank to impose margin calls on co-founder Adam Neumann. The Japanese tech group and the US bank have submitted competing plans to pump as much as $5bn into WeWork in a debt-and-equity deal that could value the group’s equity at $8bn or less, according to multiple people briefed on the matter.  The proposal from SoftBank, which has already sunk more than $10bn into the company, would significantly dilute other equity holders, including Mr Neumann. Should Mr Neumann’s equity stake suffer a significant writedown as part of the deal, he could face a margin call from JPMorgan, UBS and Credit Suisse. They have lent the former WeWork chief executive hundreds of millions of dollars, using his stock as the main collateral, according to regulatory filings and people with knowledge of the matter. To meet the lenders’ capital demands, Mr Neumann could be forced to pledge additional shares or cash in the margin call and sell some of the property and other assets he has accumulated. The entrepreneur has raised at least $700m through share sales and loans against his equity stake.  The stake owned by Mr Neumann and co-founder Miguel McKelvey was worth almost $13bn earlier this year, which would be worth about $2bn if the company’s valuation plummets to $8bn. After dilution, though, it would be worth far less. That does not include the value of a stake that Mr Neumann was granted in a complex transaction this summer.  If he were unable to meet the margin call or repay the loan, the lenders would face losses. The banks had earlier this year extended a $500m credit facility to the WeWork co-founder, with $380m of that line tapped by Mr Neumann as of the end of July. JPMorgan has also lent Mr Neumann nearly $100m, regulatory filings showed. Mr Neumann declined to comment through a spokesperson. Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, SoftBank, UBS and WeWork declined to comment. Adding to the strain between JPMorgan and SoftBank is the fact that the Japanese group has not engaged in formal negotiations with the Wall Street lender. This leaves the bank unaware of how exactly the SoftBank proposal will affect earlier investors such as Mr Neumann, one of the people added. The WeWork board has only a few weeks to decide on the financial lifeline it will choose as its cash crunch intensifies. Some people informed of the talks said it could ultimately settle on a mix of the two deals, with an equity and debt package that avoids a margin call on Mr Neumann. JPMorgan is putting together a $5bn financing package that would include about $2bn in unsecured debt, structured as payment-in-kind notes and carrying a coupon of up to 15 per cent, said people who saw the terms of the offer.   The expensive capital, which is still being negotiated with investors, reflects the risk that lenders would be taking on when financing a company that expects to burn through its current funding by late November — faster than expected in the aftermath of September’s aborted initial public offering. JPMorgan has pitched the offering to about 100 institutional investors.  SoftBank had earlier committed to inject $1.5bn into WeWork in April 2020 at a valuation of $47bn. It is now renegotiating the size, timing and valuation of that agreement, multiple people familiar with the situation said. One added that it could put some or all of this sum into WeWork faster to address the company’s cash crunch, but would look to do so at a much lower valuation. Potential conflicts of interest among directors representing competing ownership stakes — including SoftBank and Mr Neumann — have prompted WeWork’s board to establish a special committee to evaluate its financing options.  SoftBank has hired restructuring bankers at Houlihan Lokey to advise them on how to revive WeWork, according to people briefed about the matter. The bankruptcy specialists are assessing ways to cut WeWork’s liabilities as well as determining the company’s valuation by going through its portfolio building by building, those people added. Bloomberg first reported the $8bn potential valuation.","18.10.2019"
"Credit Suisse to take majority stake in Chinese joint venture","Latest sign China is opening up its financial sector to overseas competition","Credit Suisse is poised to take majority control of its Chinese investment-banking joint venture, the second major international lender to do so as the country opens up its financial sector to overseas competition. The Swiss bank has reached an agreement with partner Founder Securities to increase its stake in their joint venture to 51 per cent from 33.3 per cent, a previous limit for non-Chinese companies, by way of a capital injection of about SFr94m ($94m), according to statements from both parties on Monday. The deal still has to be approved by regulators, expected in August. Credit Suisse follows local rival UBS, which won approval from regulators to take a controlling stake in its own joint venture in December. The presence of another international bank onshore in China shows the eventual success of a decades-long lobbying campaign in Beijing, which argued the country’s nascent capital markets would benefit from foreign investment and expertise. Despite numerous setbacks, pressure has recently built on China’s top leadership to open their markets if they expect reciprocal treatment overseas. Regulators vowed to speed up the process and a year ago gave clearer timeframes for allowing banks, securities companies, asset managers and insurers to take full ownership of their local operations. Of other international banks, only HSBC has been granted permission to take a 51 per cent stake in a national-level securities joint venture, taking advantage of special rules for Hong Kong-funded institutions. JPMorgan and Nomura have received permission to set up majority controlled JVs. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have said they are considering similar moves.","15.04.2019"
"Chasing wealth managers is a risky business","Private banks are fighting to advise billionaires who want a lot for their money","Zurich is a sober and orderly city, so a fierce altercation near the Swiss National Bank between a banker to the world’s billionaires and a private detective who was trailing him is worthy of John Le Carré. It is all the more lurid that Credit Suisse ordered surveillance of Iqbal Khan after he left abruptly for its rival UBS. Credit Suisse was worried that Mr Khan, who led an expansion of wealth management there, could take valuable clients and colleagues with him. Cut to Germany, where Deutsche Bank is hoping to recruit several hundred “relationship managers” — financial advisers to the wealthy — to compete with Switzerland’s private banks. Whenever banks get overexcited about a profitable and expanding area of finance and embark on an expensive talent war, it usually leads to trouble down the road. So it is a fair bet that there will be fallout from this battle over wealth management, the activity that includes private banking. The stampede is understandable. Swiss private banks went through tough times after the 2008 financial crisis and a US crackdown on offshore tax evasion that led to banks including UBS being fined hundreds of millions and having to loosen traditional bank secrecy rules. But they never lost their grip on a business that many rivals envy. Traditional retail banking has been less profitable in the era of low interest rates and digital insurgency. Investment banking has been squeezed by regulations and caused a lot of trouble at European banks, notably Deutsche. When boards of global banks gather for strategy days, it can get gloomy. Wealth management feels like a profitable one-way bet, by comparison. It does not require much capital to advise clients on how to conserve and invest their wealth, and the returns on equity are high. The rise of billionaire entrepreneurs and the super-rich, particularly in China and the rest of Asia, keeps the market growing. This makes private bankers, particularly relationship managers with clients they have served for years, desirable. It is hard for an institution without a long history in private banking to expand without hiring them from other banks — the rule of thumb at one Swiss bank is that one manager can advise clients with a total of $1bn in assets. Hence the unruly scene on the streets of Zurich and the poaching of bankers that is occurring around the world. Boris Collardi, who led the expansion of Julius Baer as chief executive, is now heading a hiring drive at Pictet, including the appointment of Tee Fong-Seng as head of wealth management in Asia. But as banks offer millions to lure private bankers with desirable clients, they should consider a few things. First, a relationship manager may not bring clients with them. The personal touch helps: private banks advise clients not only on investments but on sensitive matters such as family succession and trusts. But the expertise (and credit rating) of the bank also counts: “Assets are sticky and they take time to transfer. Sometimes they do not come at all,” one Swiss banker says. The danger is that the hiring war will prove an expensive zero-sum game in which costs grow faster than revenues. McKinsey & Co, the consultancy, this week sounded a warning that profits fell by 8 per cent at private banks in western Europe last year, as rising costs squeezed their margins. Second, private banking to the emerging class of ultra-wealthy in Asia is not free of risk. Under Mr Khan, Credit Suisse targeted Asia entrepreneurs with assets of about $500m, whose wealth tends to be tied up in their own companies, and who often want to borrow against these assets to buy houses in Mayfair or large yachts. So far, banks that lend to wealthy clients have made money — one banker estimates that loan default rates have only been about 0.1 per cent. But those loans have yet to be tested in a global recession, with falling asset valuations. Only then will we discover how profitable the business really is. Third, despite rivalry among private banks, their ultimate competitors are the clients themselves. Wealth managers pitch themselves as trusted advisers but the ultra-rich with more than $100m are different from you and me — many employ their own investment advisers and lawyers in family offices. There are now more than 10,000 single family offices, according to the consultancy EY, and the number is rising as more of the merely rich band together in multifamily offices. When it happens, private bankers are often excluded from the inner circle, where the most profitable decisions are made, and must pitch for smaller bits of business. It is not a mystery that the richer someone is, the harder the bargain he or she tends to strike. The days of millionaires depositing money with Swiss banks and only occasionally visiting Lake Geneva to catch up with their bankers are in the past. Billionaires do not hand over cash lightly. Wealth management is still an attractive business, given the alternatives. But before they start following bankers around the streets of Zurich and Singapore, banks should realise what they are rushing into. In finance, one-way bets are rarely what they seem. john.gapper@ft.com

Following the departure of Bennett Goodman (pictured below), announced on Thursday, Blackstone’s sprawling credit business GSO will be just as inaptly named. Bennett Goodman: GSO's business has become increasingly important to Blackstone © Bloomberg With about $140bn of assets under management, and a presence stretching from San Francisco to Frankfurt, it is a sprawling financial fiefdom that now manages more money than Blackstone’s traditional buyout funds. Goodman founded GSO in 2005 with Tripp Smith and Doug Ostrover, and the trio’s surnames form the firm’s three initials. But none of them are left. Smith left last year to raise his own credit fund (and has already poached at least one other senior GSO executive). Ostrover left in 2015 and has since formed Owl Rock alongside former dealmakers from investment bank Goldman Sachs and rival private equity firm KKR. Goodman’s departure comes only a few months after he negotiated a new pay package at Blackstone that provided faster vesting of a $200m share award dating from 2015. Crucially, Goodman also received new sweeteners for five years after he retires from Blackstone. At the time, Blackstone said the concessions amounted to a new “new multiyear retention arrangement”. Whereas earlier defectors have sought to raise outside capital for their new ventures, Blackstone suggested that Goodman would follow a different path. He “plans to establish a new Goodman family office”, the firm said in a statement on Thursday, adding that he would remain on hand at Blackstone to advise on direct lending and smooth relations with some investors.

"Jefferies and Credit Suisse set to lose on Israeli cyber security deal","Investors balk at $510m loan backing acquisition of NSO, which has been criticised by Amnesty","Jefferies and Credit Suisse have got their fingers burnt underwriting the leveraged buyout of a controversial Israeli cyber security company, which Amnesty International recently criticised for allegedly providing spyware to target political dissidents. The two Wall Street banks have faced difficulty selling a $510m loan backing UK private equity firm Novalpina Capital’s acquisition of NSO Group, despite an otherwise hot market for leveraged loans.  Investors have balked at the deal because of corporate governance concerns over the Herzliya-based company, which is being sued by a Saudi dissident who claims its software was used to spy on murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi. NSO has said that the suit is “completely unfounded”. Jefferies and Credit Suisse now look set to lose money on their decision to back the debt deal, according to bankers and investors, after being forced to offer the loans at just 90 cents on the dollar — one of the steepest discounts to face value the leveraged loan market has seen in years. People familiar with the matter said the two banks had also not yet fully sold the deal, even though it is due to formally close on Tuesday. This raises the prospect that the underwriters will have to hold some of the debt on their balance sheet, potentially weighing on the banks’ capital position. Jefferies and Credit Suisse both declined to comment. The botched deal shows how some investment banks are underwriting debt for increasingly high-risk borrowers in an effort to win business in the crowded market for US leveraged loans, which are generally provided to companies already carrying lots of debt. NSO says that it helps government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to prevent and investigate terrorism and crime. Sales of its so-called “Pegasus” software, which exploits weaknesses in smartphones to track encrypted messages, accounted for about three-quarters of the company’s more than $250m in revenues last year, according to an investor who has seen the presentation to potential buyers of the loan. The investor added that Novalpina was putting $246m of equity into the group, with $114m coming from NSO’s management team. A spokesperson for NSO said that the company was “committed to the ethical and responsible use of our technology”. NSO has also previously denied its software was used to track Mr Khashoggi. Amnesty International wrote an open letter to Novalpina in February raising concerns that NSO’s software was being used to target people “solely as a result of their criticism of governments”. Novalpina’s founder Stephen Peel, a former senior partner at private equity heavyweight TPG, stepped down from the board of international human rights group Global Witness the same day. Mr Peel wrote a letter in response to Amnesty last month that outlined the private equity firm’s due diligence into NSO, which he said found no evidence to “substantiate the misuse allegations”. A spokesman for the group told the Financial Times that NSO’s software had “saved thousands of lives, helping prevent suicide bombers, stop drug and sex trafficking rings and rescue kidnapped children”. That argument has done little to assuage leveraged loan investors.  The investor considered it would be “almost impossible” for most collateralised loan obligations to buy the loan, as they have to regularly report their holdings publicly. These structured investment vehicles are normally one of the biggest buyers of such loans, fuelling a boom in riskier debt that has worried policymakers worldwide.  The lack of demand for the NSO debt comes despite investment banks managing the deal jacking up its interest rate to 700 basis points over Libor, equating to more than 9.5 per cent at prevailing rates. Bankers running the deal have also beefed up the loan’s covenants — key investor protections — while adding in terms that divert the group’s excess cash to paying down the debt. Despite these sweeteners, Jefferies and Credit Suisse have pushed the deal’s deadline several times and this week jettisoned an effort to sell a euro-denominated piece of the loan entirely.","09.04.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Infineon, Keir, Scapa, Tate & Lyle, Ocado, Experian","Ditching the Champions League would give BT a £200m cash flow boost, says Credit Suisse","Monday 13:00 BST What’s happening ● Infineon dropped on a cautious response to the chipmaker’s €9bn cash bid for US peer Cypress Semiconductor. The price, which was 30 per cent funded by a planned share issue, was equivalent to 19.5 times Cypress’s current year earnings. “At first glance, we think the proposed deal appears expensive on an enterprise value multiple basis, and we think its success will likely depend on the ability to extract sales synergies to generate a strong return on capital,” said UBS. It liked the potential synergies from Cypress’s reliance on auto and internet-of-things end markets, accounting for more than two-thirds of sales. Citigroup questioned whether Infineon was wise to dilute its product range with in-car information systems, having previously focused on the higher-growth safety and powertrain applications. “Our initial view is that the overall risk-reward profile of the deal is unfavorable, as scale and diversification benefits are more than offset by diminished positioning appeal, hard-to-substantiate revenue synergies and execution/regulatory risks. As such the deal requires investors to take a longer-term leap of faith, which we believe will prove hard amidst an uncertain near-term demand backdrop.”Citi ● Kier led the FTSE 250 fallers on a profit warning. The UK engineering outsourcer lowered full-year earnings guidance by about 30 per cent to reflect lower highways maintenance spending, delays to a customer’s fibre network rollout and stalled construction projects. Andrew Davies, Kier’s recently appointed chief executive, also announced £15m of restructuring costs. The warning meant Kier, which raised cash at 409p a share with a rights issue in December, would swing back into net debt by the full year, said Liberum. It forecast a £70m adverse swing in cash, resulting in £36m of net debt. ● Scapa slumped by the most on record after the industrial tape maker said ConvaTec, the medical products maker, was cancelling a contract worth £23m a year. The Aim-listed company said ConvaTec had no grounds to cancel the contract, which had three years left to run, and had filed to a US federal court for an “action for declaratory judgment”. The news came two weeks after Scapa said Heejae Chae was stepping down as chief executive after 10 years with the company. “From our understanding a declaratory judgment does not typically implicate damages, but simply provides legal certainty on the dispute at hand. However, Scapa has indicated it will defend its right under the [contract] and pursue all rights and remedies . . . Assuming the issue remains contained to the ConvaTec contract, we believe this would be a loss of revenue in the region of C$30m. Assuming typical gross margins, we believe this contract loss could see earnings downgrades circa 20% on an adjusted basis. However, this is subject to error and we expect more financial guidance from the company in the coming days and weeks.”Berenberg Sellside stories ● Jefferies downgraded Tate & Lyle, the food ingredients maker, to “underperform” from “hold” with a 660p target price. It said the stock was at a 30 per cent premium to “near-identical peer Ingredion” in spite of second-half headwinds, ambitious 2020 guidance and the risk that management would pursue an expensive acquisition or a break-up strategy.  Tate’s full-year guidance of broadly flat to low single-digit earnings per share growth “strikes us as difficult to achieve” given a rising tax burden and a tough year-on-year comparison, given 2018 benefited from a £6m windfall profit from its Sucralose sweetener, Jefferies said. It expected growth from Tate’s specialist ingredients business to be too slow to offset pressure elsewhere, particularly as US corn prices have spiked higher. On the US threat to impose trade tariffs on Mexico, Jefferies called the spat “unhelpful” for sentiment but “directionally in the price”. Nevertheless, any escalation might make 2020 high-fructose corn syrup contract pricing more difficult, Jefferies added. ● Credit Suisse upgraded BT to “outperform” from “neutral” with a 280p target. The main reason for the upgrade was an increased confidence in BT’s ability to return to sustainable operating earnings growth from 2021, Credit Suisse said. BT’s four-year low enterprise value versus earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation added to conviction and offset any short-term impact of a recent cut to 2020 guidance, the broker said. The stars were finally aligning for BT’s Openreach wholesale division, Credit Suisse said. Citing a more pro-investment stance at regulator Ofcom, the accelerating adoption of fibre in the UK and improving build economics, it forecast fibre-to-the-premises adoption to hit 50 per cent within 10 years, generating a 14.5 per cent pre-tax return on capital employed for BT. Credit Suisse also highlighted that BT’s Champions League broadcast rights were back up for auction in early 2020. Ditching content could boost BT’s free cash flow by up to £200m by 2020, supporting a fair value per share of 330p, it said. ● Jefferies downgraded Ocado, the online grocery systems developer, to “underperform” from “hold” with a 600p target. The stock’s current valuation “assumes an unequivocal commercial success of the Ocado Smart Platform for its existing customers” as well as a near threefold expansion of its warehouse network, the broker said. Ocado’s £8.2bn equity value appears to price in another 150 customer warehouses, in addition to the 38 planned currently, said Jefferies. It estimated that existing contacts were worth just 210p a share, suggesting around 780p was being pinned on future deals.  Jefferies worried about Ocado’s reputation being harmed by a slow start to its landmark deal with US retailer Kroger for 20 warehouses. A “moderate build in capacity utilisation” might undo scale benefits and drag on profit margins, it said, adding: “The additional circa 5 per cent of gross fees payable to Ocado could stretch the economics of the venture, especially in the early stages of capacity being installed. The biggest risk is that the second wave of [warehouse] openings will be significantly reduced from the expected total of 17.” ● In brief: Adevinta rated new “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Aurubis cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Beazley cut to “hold” at Investec; BioMérieux rated new “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; Charles Taylor rated new “buy” at Canaccord; CompuGroup rated new “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; DiaSorin rated new “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Experian raised to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Grifols rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Informa cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Ipsen raised to “buy” at UBS; Lagardère upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Loungers rated new “buy” at Liberum; Mediclinic raised to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Pirelli upgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; SDX Energy rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Sartorius rated new “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; Scout24 raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Wacker Chemie raised to “hold” at Berenberg Read more

"Prudential singles out ambitions as it prepares to split in two","Build-up to long-awaited demerger of UK insurance group has been overshadowed by problems","Prudential will split itself in two on Monday, but the run-up to the long-awaited move has been overshadowed by a fine from regulators, the blocking of a £12bn deal and allegations of sexual harassment by a fund manager.  Plans for the split, which will separate the insurance company’s UK business from operations in Asia and the US to give investors more choice about which parts of the group they want to own, have been under way since March last year and have cost £355m. Investors will be given one share in M&G plc — the demerged UK business — for every Prudential share they own. Analysts think that M&G will have a valuation of between £6bn and £8.5bn when trading starts on Monday morning, which would be enough to put it into the FTSE 100.  However, the past three months have been marred by a number of problems for the group. In August, the UK High Court blocked a proposed £12bn annuity transfer to specialist insurer Rothesay, while in September Prudential was fined £24m by regulators for failing to treat customers fairly.  Last week Bloomberg reported allegations that an unnamed senior fund manager at M&G — Prudential’s asset management business — had been sexually harassing female colleagues for several years. The behaviour allegedly included sexually explicit text messages, inappropriate comments and unwanted physical contact. John Foley, chief executive of M&G, said: “What’s been alleged in terms of culture will not prevail here. We will root it out. We are investigating it and we will get to the bottom of it.” As the split is not an initial public offering, there is no initial price range. Analyst estimates for the M&G market capitalisation range from Citi and Credit Suisse at £6bn to Jefferies at £8.5bn. At the lower end of the range, the share price would be 230p; at the upper end it would be 326p.  However, the price is expected to be volatile immediately after the split as investors decide if they want to own shares in both companies. On Monday, shares in Prudential PLC — housing the US and Asian businesses — are expected to fall, as it will no longer own the UK operation.  “You will have some forced sellers from M&G,” said Abid Hussain, analyst at Credit Suisse. “People in Singapore, for example, might not be able to hold M&G shares for longer than 30 days.” However, he added that these “natural sellers” could be replaced by income funds who might not own the shares already. Mr Foley has been touring investors to tell them about his plans for the company, which include the M&G fund management business and Prudential’s UK life insurance operation. “This part of the business has not been well understood by investors in the past. We’ve had a series of education sessions with them about what they already own,” he said. “They are asking about two things — growth and cash generation.”  M&G hopes to deliver both, with growth coming from expansion in Asia and Europe and cash generation coming from the back book of old insurance policies.  “After the demerger, we will have a lot more discretion over our balance sheet and around where we grow,” said Mr Foley. However analysts say that growth will not be the main attraction for investors.  “I think it will trade as a UK dividend stock,” said Andrew Baker, analyst at Citi. “Investors will care about capital generation and dividend cover. They will gravitate more to that than to growth.” The company will also face questions about its strategy. “You’ll have a headquarters in a location where you have no operations,” said Mr Hussain. “Over the long term, will it be an Asia and US business or a pure Asia growth franchise? Should the opportunity arise to list or sell the US business, I think management would seriously consider the option down the line.” Daily newsletter

"Stocks to watch: Tesla, Sainsbury’s, Taylor Wimpey, ASMI, 3M","Adidas needs to rediscover its heat to compete, says Credit Suisse","Thursday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● J Sainsbury led the FTSE 100 fallers after the Competition and Markets Authority formally blocked the supermarket’s proposed Asda merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and reduce the quality and range of products available to shoppers. Sainsbury’s and Asda said they would not contest the decision and mutually agreed to terminate the deal. The CMA’s confirmation raised fears that Sainsbury’s would reset profit margin targets, perhaps as early as full-year results due on May 1. “Sainsbury has been struggling in terms of top-line momentum against a resurgent Tesco. Further, thanks to the strength of the margin recovery in International, Tesco can afford to effectively cap the UK margin recovery to just over 3 per cent, which gives it options to step up the offensive. Sainsbury’s will now need to act to reverse the sales underperformance, though we are not fully sure if there’s a willingness to reset the business.”Macquarie Goldman Sachs said if Sainsbury did not change strategy, its 2020 full-year earnings were likely to miss consensus forecasts by 10 per cent. “We also highlight that if the company considers that a more comprehensive strategic change is needed, as Tesco and Morrisons did in 2014, we estimate a similar margin investment would be equivalent to circa 60 per cent of full-year earnings before interest and tax,” it added. ● Taylor Wimpey led the UK housebuilders lower after its first-quarter update raised concerns about rising build costs. The company said full-year volumes would be slightly higher versus 2018 and that selling prices remained flat in a “stable” market. But margins were weakening due mainly to build cost inflation, which was guided at 5 per cent versus previous guidance of 3 per cent to 4 per cent, Taylor Wimpey said. While high levels of forward sales should defer the hit to the second half of 2019, the lack of price rises and higher costs would gnaw away at housebuilder margins, said Shore Capital. “The previous commentary from the sector and the forecast consensus has been too bullish . . . and this statement confirms that it is right to be looking for at least a fade in profit before tax here rather than sustained growth,” it added.  ● ASM International hit a record high after the chip foundry operator said order strength meant first-half sales would exceed previous guidance. The Dutch group posted first-quarter revenue of €249m, above the top end of its target range, which slightly offset lower gross margins.  ● 3M, the US maker of Post-it notes, plunged after posting much weaker than expected results and cutting 2019 guidance. First-quarter earnings per share were $2.23 compared with a $2.51 consensus, which meant organic sales growth turned negative with all company segments underperforming forecasts. Management also revealed two big litigation charges related to industrial chemicals and coal mine dust at a cost of $0.72 per share. Blaming operational issues for the warning, 3M announced a restructuring plan to cut 2,000 jobs and save between $225m and $250m annually.  “Good execution has historically been a hallmark of 3M, and it appears the company is now undergoing a transition . . . that may take several quarters to realise,” said Goldman Sachs. “We note that the first quarter was the easiest [year-on-year comparison] for 3M. As a result, we are surprised that the organic growth guidance was not reduced further, highlighting that despite the large cut to full-year guidance, it may still not be conservative enough.” Sellside stories ● Wedbush downgraded Tesla to “neutral” from “outperform” on the back of first-quarter results overnight, which missed consensus expectations but came with reiterated full-year guidance. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said there was “merit to raising capital” after revealing cash burn of $1.5bn in the quarter. Wedbush said it had lost confidence in Tesla “with no pilot on the plane to navigate through this severe demand turbulence”. The company had failed to adapt to a quickly evolving electric vehicle market, especially in the US, Wedbush said. “To this point, in our 20 years of covering tech stocks on the Street we view this quarter as one of [the] top debacles we have ever seen, while Musk & Co in an episode out of the Twilight Zone act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story.” Wedbush called Tesla’s experiments with robotaxis and insurance products as “distractions from the growing demand woes that are not being addressed”. It forecast that Tesla would have to raise $3bn-plus in the near term to sustain its capital expenditure and debt needs. “As such, we no longer can look investors in the eye and recommend buying this stock at current levels until Tesla starts to take its medicine and focus on reality around demand issues, which is the core focus of investors. This morning we are throwing in the white towel.” ● Credit Suisse downgraded Adidas to “neutral” from “overweight” with a €2.35 price target. “Although Adidas represents a reasonably valued play on global sporting goods, the lack of brand momentum is a growing concern, and with first-quarter results (due May 3) likely to be soft, it is hard to see potential for further re-rating before we see evidence of sales accelerating in the second half.”Credit Suisse Supply chain problems should be resolved by midyear, having cut group sales by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, but “overall brand heat” was a bigger concern, said Credit Suisse. Footwear sales in Europe and North America needed to reaccelerate, Instagram engagement “has been quite soft”, and consumer surveys suggested the company’s lead in emerging markets might be softening, it said. The broker also argued that Adidas needed to displace fast-growing smaller brands such as Vans, Fila and Champion from its key distributors. While Adidas was valued at discounts of 27 per cent and 34 per cent to Nike and Puma respectively, likely sales growth of just 4 per cent in the first half left “little likelihood of that gap narrowing without clear evidence of recovery in sales and brand heat”, Credit Suisse concluded. ● In brief: Aker BP cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Capital Drilling rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Julius Baer cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Kion downgraded to “hold” at Commerzbank; Munters cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Novartis raised to “buy” at Liberum; Photo-Me raised to “buy” at N+1 Singer; Suedzucker raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"Credit Suisse gives CEO 30% pay rise despite share price fall","Tidjane Thiam awarded $12.8m in 2018 after Swiss bank returns to profit","Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam received a 30 per cent pay rise last year — despite a 38 per cent plunge in the stock — after a cap on his pay was removed and the Swiss bank returned to profit following a three-year lossmaking streak. Mr Thiam was awarded a total of SFr12.7m ($12.8m) for 2018, according to the bank’s annual report published on Friday. This compares to the SFr9.7m he received the year before, when he took a voluntary SFr1.5m pay cut after shareholders protested about the bank’s remuneration policy. His potential short-term bonus as a proportion of his base salary also increased to 1.83 times from 1.5, resulting in an extra SFr500,000 in cash upfront. “This adjustment is designed to acknowledge the strong performance of Mr Thiam over the course of his tenure to date,” said Kai Nargolwala, the board member in charge of compensation, in a letter to investors. He cited earnings, capital and cost improvements, a share buyback programme and a lowering of risk at the investment bank. The CEO’s 2018 pay breaks down into a SFr3.4m salary and SFr9.3m in bonuses and long-term incentives — including SFr2.5m in cash — out of a potential maximum of SFr16m. However, Mr Thiam is not guaranteed to receive that much; over the past three years, Credit Suisse executives have received around half their so-called deferred “incentive pay” because of poor earnings and share price declines. Credit Suisse’s 2018 net income rose to SFr2.1bn from a loss of SFr983m a year earlier as earnings from its core wealth management and Swiss divisions overcame yet another woeful performance from traders at its investment bank. However, the lender made a return on tangible equity of 5.5 per cent for the whole of 2018, about half what it is targeting. While the bank’s share price has recovered slightly this year — rising 9 per cent, more than most European peers — it is still down about 40 per cent since Mr Thiam took over in 2015. 40%Decline in the Credit Suisse share price since Tidjane Thiam took over as chief executive in 2015  Overall, the top 12 executives received a big boost. They were paid a combined SFr93.5m for 2018, out of a potential SFr115m, up from SFr70m and SFr73m in 2017 and 2016 respectively when they took voluntary cuts.  At the lender’s April 26 annual meeting, the bank will propose to increase top managers’ maximum potential pay to SFr123m next year, the report shows. It does not break down how much individual executives stand to earn in 2019. The bank froze its overall 2018 group bonus pool at SFr3.2bn ($3.2bn), confirming a Financial Times report from February. Rival UBS decreased its own pool 1 per cent to $3.1bn and total pay, including bonuses and incentive plans, for its chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, was also cut 1 per cent to SFr13.8m. Credit Suisse said in its annual report that it had “increased the level of differentiation for high-performing employees”, which in practice means its wealth managers, private and M&A advisory bankers were given more, reflecting their strategic importance to the group and higher profitability. By contrast, the bank’s traders saw their share of bonuses fall after the global markets business abandoned its revenue target and posted losses in the final two quarters of last year. Chairman Urs Rohner, who voluntarily waived SFr450,000 of his SFr1.5m chairman’s fee last year, has decided to take his full entitlement this time. The Zurich-based lender has to tread carefully on pay after the board was sharply criticised by investors for boosting bonuses 3 per cent in 2017 and 6 per cent in 2016, despite making more than SFr3bn of annual losses over that period. To appease shareholders, executives took voluntary 40 per cent reductions to their bonuses over those two years. Mr Thiam has reshaped the 162-year-old Swiss bank since joining from insurer Prudential, refocusing it on managing the wealth of the world’s ultra-rich, especially in Asia, while taking an axe to the unpredictable and capital-intensive trading business. It has not been an easy ride for the French executive. Credit Suisse made SFr6.7bn of combined net losses from 2015 to 2017 as it unwound risky leveraged trading positions, cut more than 10,000 jobs and paid big misconduct fines around the world. Even as Credit Suisse’s bonus pool and executive pay has been gradually creeping back up in recent years, overall pay — which includes both salaries and bonuses — fell to SFr9.6bn in 2018 compared with SFr10.4bn last year and SFr16bn in 2011, said Mr Nargolwala. This article has been updated to clarify that Sergio Ermotti’s SFr13.8m in 2018 was total pay including bonuses and incentive plans.

"Vatican police investigate Holy See’s bet on Chelsea property project","Chelsea development generated large profits for investment fund of UK-based financier","The Vatican is investigating how $200m in Swiss bank accounts controlled by its central administrator ended up financing a luxury property development in London’s Chelsea district that generated large profits for a company that managed the investment for the Holy See. The project to construct 49 luxury apartments at 60 Sloane Avenue has become the focus of an investigation by Vatican police into the financial activities of the Holy See’s Secretariat of State, the custodian of millions of dollars in charity given by Catholics around the world, according to multiple people familiar with the probe. This month, Vatican police seized documents and computers from the Secretariat in search of evidence about the project and suspended five employees pending the results of its investigation.  The Vatican became involved in the Chelsea project in 2014 when $200m held in Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Secretariat of State was transferred to a Luxembourg investment fund called Athena Capital. Athena is owned by the Italian London-based financier Raffaele Mincione through his company WRM. Athena had bought the Chelsea building for £129m in 2012 and then sold a minority stake in the project in 2014 to a fund it managed on behalf of the Vatican as a sole client. In 2018, the Vatican bought out the remaining equity in 60 Sloane Avenue from Athena. Mr Mincione’s vehicle earned around £130m from the project overall. The Vatican declined to comment about its ownership of the London building, or confirm the subject of the raids on the offices of the Secretariat. Mr Mincione worked for nearly 20 years at various investment banks, mostly in London in fixed income and derivatives, before starting an investment vehicle in 2009. Since 2011, he has bought large equity stakes in several small Italian banks, including Banca Carige. People familiar with the deal said that the Holy See’s investment with Mr Mincione was personally authorised by Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who met the London-based financier inside the Vatican. The current building at 60 Sloane Avenue in Chelsea © Tolga Akmen/FT Cardinal Becciu was at the time in charge of the administrative duties of the Secretary of State, and reported on a daily basis to Pope Benedict, and later Pope Francis. Cardinal Becciu, through his office, declined to comment. WRM said that it could not comment on the Vatican probe. It said: “We have no inside knowledge of these investigations or the circumstances that led to them. We are secure and confident in the knowledge that no wrongdoing or improprieties were conducted by the WRM group or any of its companies.” It said the Vatican Secretariat had been constantly kept updated of its investment in the Athena fund through its private bankers Credit Suisse and all of its transactions and accounts had been audited. Credit Suisse declined to comment. Athena Capital first purchased 60 Sloane Avenue in 2012 for £129m with a £75m mortgage from Deutsche Bank that was later refinanced with a £100m loan from hedge fund Cheyne Capital.  In November last year, the Vatican Secretariat sent an official to London to meet Athena Capital and negotiated the buyout of the fund’s 55 per cent stake in the building at 60 Sloane Avenue.  After a complicated asset swap that involved the Holy See transferring £40m to Athena as well as other assets owned by Athena on its behalf, the Vatican took control of the property. In addition, it has taken over the £100m debt attached to the project.  The $200m originally invested by the Secretariat with Athena in 2014 was worth around £128m at exchange rates at the time. If that is added to the £40m paid to Athena in 2018, the Vatican ended up buying Mr Mincione’s equity in the Chelsea building for £168m.  That would mean Mr Mincione made a £128m profit after the £40m he originally invested in 2012. WRM said that the profits it made by selling a minority stake in Mr Mincione’s building to the Secretariat in 2014 were based on an independent valuation conducted by CBRE, and that the value of the building had sharply appreciated along with other prime London real estate from 2012 to 2014. Cheyne Capital declined to comment. There is no evidence to suggest that Cheyne Capital, which acted as a third-party lender, is involved in the Vatican’s investigation into the property deal.

"UBS: Swiss Khan do ","A credible transition plan will not make it easier to revive dismal share price showing","Smart-suited Swiss private bankers offer wealthy clients a palette of services. One is succession planning. UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager, has finally drawn up its own scheme. A reshuffle on Thursday revamped the top team below Sergio Ermotti, chief executive since 2011. The effect was to start the race to replace him. For now the frontrunner is the youthful Iqbal Khan, a recent defector from local rival Credit Suisse, who becomes joint head of the main wealth management unit. Having a credible transition plan is a relief for Axel Weber, the former German central bank president who chairs UBS. It will not make it any easier for Mr Ermotti or him to revive the bank’s dismal share price performance.  Even in a weakening European bank sector, UBS’s stock has underperformed its main Swiss rivals this year, falling 11 per cent. True, it generates respectable double-digit returns on equity. Relative to book values, the shares trade at four times Deutsche Bank’s multiple. It has stolen a lead in China, and, belatedly, pushed into the US. But a deteriorating global economic environment is buffeting Switzerland’s largest bank. Financial market turmoil has stopped wealthy clients from trading. Interest rates plunging deeper below zero have squeezed margins. In February a French court levied a €3.7bn fine in a case related to tax evasion by clients. In June, an analyst’s note upset clients in China. UBS’s downsized investment bank, meanwhile, still causes earnings upsets. Mr Ermotti sees it as essential for serving the ultra wealthy, especially in Asia, and combating competition from big US rivals. He successfully executed UBS’s shift to wealth management after the global financial crisis.  He is now UBS’s longest-serving chief executive since it was formed by a 1998 merger. Thursday’s reshuffle implicitly acknowledged change was needed. The big loser was Martin Blessing, scion of a German banking family, who lasted just three years at UBS. His replacement, Mr Khan, quit Credit Suisse amid tensions with its boss Tidjane Thiam.  Other challengers include Sabine Keller-Busse, chief operating officer, and Tom Naratil, co-head of wealth management.  Resulting internal strife could be creative — or destructive. Mr Ermotti’s job will only become harder if it is the latter.  ","29.08.2019"
"The Vatican, a Chelsea property deal and Brexit","Pope Francis has ordered an investigation into a London investment by the body managing charitable donations"," In 2012, private bankers at Credit Suisse arranged a meeting at their Canary Wharf offices in London that required even more discretion than usual. There a representative of one of their most secretive clients sat down with a man claiming to be able to perform miracles with money.  The client, an ultra-high net worth European account, had been studying an investment into a risky oil project in Africa, and the stylish Italian financier was there to offer his expert advice.  After a year of deliberations the Italian had returned with his opinion. The oil investment would not be profitable, but instead he could put a new, far more lucrative opportunity on the table: selling the client a stake in his own luxury property development in one of London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods. By 2014 a total of $200m had been wired from accounts at Credit Suisse and Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), a Lugano-based private bank, to an investment fund managed by one of the Italian financier’s companies in Luxembourg.  The ultra-high net worth client was none other than the Secretariat of State for the Vatican — custodian of hundreds of millions of charitable donations from the Catholic faithful around the world for the poor and needy.  The luxury property in Chelsea, 60 Sloane Avenue, in which the Vatican invested © Tolga Akmen/FT As a result of the investment, the Secretariat was now the part owner of a scheme to build 49 luxury apartments in London’s Chelsea — a speculative development plan that was made even riskier after Britain’s vote to leave the EU in 2016 sent shivers through the capital’s prime real estate market. This month cardinals were left stunned when the Vatican’s own police raided the offices of the Secretariat — the central bureaucracy of the Holy See — to seize financial documents and computers, while five members of staff were suspended.  That same week Pope Francis drafted in Giuseppe Pignatone, one of Italy’s most feared anti-mafia judges who helped bring down the capo of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, Bernardo Provenzano, as head of the Vatican’s prosecution service.  The Vatican has declined to comment on why it staged the unprecedented raid on its own offices beyond a statement that it is probing suspicious financial transactions “carried out over time”. The Financial Times has been able to establish through interviews and financial documents that the investigation is focused on how the Vatican Secretariat entered into a complex London real estate deal that was blown off-course by Brexit.  The deal, which saw the Secretariat buy a minority stake in 60 Sloane Avenue in Chelsea through an offshore structure of funds and companies, realised about £128m in profit for Raffaele Mincione, the Italian former banker who put the deal together and managed it on the Vatican Secretariat’s behalf.  Last year, with the UK luxury property market shaken by political uncertainty, the development was forced to refinance its debts with a London hedge fund. In November 2018 the Vatican Secretariat issued a demand to Mr Mincione to buy the Chelsea building outright — setting in motion the events that would lead to the police raids at the heart of the Holy See this month.  The Vatican raid, insiders say, is a rare public glimpse of a fierce battle inside the Holy See, with a faction of cardinals resisting attempts by Pope Francis to sort out and centralise its sprawling finances after decades of scandals and embarrassment for the Church.  The Secretariat’s bet on London real estate was made with funds held away from the Vatican bank, the Institute for Religious Works, which since 2013 has published an annual report of its €5.3bn of assets in an effort to show progress after past money laundering cases. In a statement, Mr Mincione’s investment company WRM said the Vatican Secretariat had been advised in all of its dealings with the fund by Credit Suisse, and all its transactions with the Secretariat were transparent and audited. The Italian financier Raffaele Mincione, who persuaded the Secretariat of State for the Vatican to invest in a luxury property development in Chelsea © David Benett/Getty “We have no inside knowledge of these investigations or the circumstances that led to them. We are secure and confident in the knowledge that no wrongdoing or improprieties were conducted by the WRM group or any of its companies,” it said. Credit Suisse declined to comment. Details of the London property deal raise questions over the actions of Giovanni Angelo Becciu, now a cardinal and at the time of the investment the substitute for general affairs of the Secretariat, its second highest ranking official and in effect chief of staff to the pope. It was in this role, which made him one of the most powerful figures inside the Holy See reporting daily to Pope Benedict and later Pope Francis, that Cardinal Becciu signed off on the investment after meeting Mr Mincione at the Vatican. Cardinal Becciu, through his office, declined to comment. Mr Mincione was not the typical company that a man of the Church such as Cardinal Becciu might be expected to keep. Born in Pomezia, 30km outside the centre of Rome in 1965, Mr Mincione moved to London in the 1980s, where he worked selling bonds and derivatives in various investment banks and developed a reputation among his colleagues as something of a playboy.  Having briefly attracted British press attention for dating the model Heather Mills in the early 1990s after meeting her in the London nightclub Stringfellows, ex-colleagues said Mr Mincione showed a penchant for taking large, risky bets. “He made a lot of money, and spent a lot of money,” says one.  During the Russian financial crisis of the late 1990s he used his bonus money to buy up Gazprom bonds at distressed prices, making several million pounds in profit when they were eventually paid out at full value.   He hit the British press again after buying a large period house in London’s Knightsbridge for what was reported as a knockdown price of £18m in 2009. He commented to a newspaper that “in a very uncertain time there is no bargain”. Mr Mincione’s biggest bet was yet to come. In 2012 he established a Jersey registered company called 60SA, arranged a £75m loan from Deutsche Bank, and for £129m bought 60 Sloane Avenue, a large building located a few minutes’ walk away from the house he had snapped up in the financial crisis.  The building’s terracotta-façade had been originally built by Harrods as a motor car showroom but now housed offices and shops on the ground floor. If the building could be demolished and rebuilt into flats while keeping the historic façade, Mr Mincione reasoned, he would stand to make hundreds of millions of pounds in profits. Why Cardinal Becciu, and his advisers at Credit Suisse, were attracted to the terms of Mr Mincione’s offer to invest in his Chelsea luxury property plan remains unclear. The investment signed off by Cardinal Becciu saw Mr Mincione transfer a stake in his London property to a fund he set up especially for the Secretariat as its sole client. He then transferred shares in the building to the new Vatican fund at a price that more than tripled the money he had invested in the property less than two years after buying it. Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu signed off on the property deal when he was in effect the pope's chief of staff © Corbis/Getty In June 2014, one month before the Vatican deal, accounts show that the value of the equity in 60 Sloane Avenue was sharply revised higher after an appraisal. Based on a new valuation by CBRE the value of the equity in the building was increased to £137.66m, or more than three times the £40m Mr Mincione had put down in December 2012 and representing a paper profit of £97.66m in just 19 months. The following month, Mr Mincione sold the fund he managed for the Vatican a 45 per cent stake in the equity of 60 Sloane Avenue at the new valuation, while he cashed out more than the value of his entire initial investment. The Vatican would not own shares in the property directly, but only through its investment in Mr Mincione’s fund, which in turn owned the majority of the equity in the building. At the time of the sale to the Vatican he had not received planning permission from Kensington & Chelsea council for the conversion. As a result of the deal structure, the Secretariat paid millions in fees to Mr Mincione, who charged a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent on profits. The Vatican funds were also used to buy unrated bonds in Mr Mincione’s own holding company, allowing him to use the cash to finance his own personal investments.  Mr Mincione, through WRM, said the valuation increase just before the Secretariat bought its stake was decided by CBRE as an independent consultant, and audited by Deloitte. The value of the London building had risen considerably since he bought it near the bottom of the market during the European debt crisis in 2012, and the hedge fund-style fees charged were normal because of the complex planning process involved.  WRM said the investments of the Secretariat’s money in the debt of Mr Mincione’s holding company were “made in full transparency with the investor and its advisers”, as well as with the fund’s regulators in Luxembourg. By 2016, after finally receiving planning permission from Kensington & Chelsea, it appeared as if his large, leveraged bet on prime London property, financed by the Vatican, was about to pay off. Then Britain voted to leave the EU. The project now had to refinance its debt while facing a far colder market. Since 2016, prime London property prices are down 10.4 per cent, according to data provider LonRes.  With 60 Sloane Avenue now a development project, rather than a simple office building, it was considered more risky by lenders. To refinance, Mr Mincione turned to the London hedge fund Cheyne Capital, which provided him with a higher interest loan in April 2018. Pope Francis brought in Giuseppe Pignatone, one of Italy's top anti-mafia judges, to invesigate the property deal © Alessandra Tarantino/AP Later that year, back in Vatican City, something important had changed. Angelo Becciu had moved from the Secretariat after being promoted to the status of cardinal by Pope Francis. Senior Vatican figures were no longer happy with owning a minority stake in 60 Sloane Avenue, and by the summer of 2018 the Secretariat dispatched an official to London to inform Mr Mincione that he would have to sell the entire building to them immediately.  By November the Secretariat had bought the building outright. The precise amount paid is hard to establish because of a complex asset swap involved in the transaction, and currency movements.  Based on a cash payment made by the Secretariat of £40m offered in the swap, and the sum of its $200m original investment in 2014 at exchange rates in that year, the Secretariat ended up paying £168m for Mr Mincione’s shares in the building, making him a £128m profit. The Vatican also took on the development’s £100m of debt, now owed to a London hedge fund. Work on demolishing the building to rebuild it into luxury flats had still not begun. The Secretariat, however, now needed to refinance the expensive debt attached to the property. One person familiar with the situation said the Secretariat turned to the Vatican bank for a loan, triggering scrutiny of the deal that eventually resulted in the raids and suspensions this month. Two of the Secretariat officials suspended by the Vatican had earlier been appointed as directors of a new company established in the UK in 2019 to hold the Secretariat’s ownership of the 60 Sloane Avenue building.  One of these, Mauro Carlino, served as secretary to Cardinal Becciu during his time at the Secretariat. Mr Carlino could not be reached for comment through the Vatican.  For the Vatican, questions remain over the oversight of an unknown number of accounts and investment funds believed to be held outside the control of the Papal State’s bank, or its centralised investment funds. The money invested with Mr Mincione by the Secretariat came from a pool of capital that is estimated by one person with knowledge of it to be at least $800m. That account is believed by some to be just one of many side-pockets of cash controlled by different Vatican entities.  While the efforts made by Pope Francis to demonstrate that the steps being taken to sort out the Holy See’s finances are more focused than those of his predecessors, there are signs that they have been repeatedly frustrated. In 2017 Libero Milone, the former chairman of Deloitte in Italy who had been hired as the Vatican’s first ever auditor, resigned from his post just two years into the job. Mr Milone said at the time that his attempts to gather financial information angered powerful figures within the Church. He claimed that before his exit he was presented by Vatican police with trumped-up charges of spying and embezzlement, and told to sign a letter of resignation on the spot.  Cardinal Becciu said at the time of Mr Milone’s claims that the auditor had broken Vatican rules and “was spying on the private lives of his superiors and staff, including me. If he had not agreed to resign, we would have prosecuted him.” All charges against Mr Milone were eventually dropped. No replacement has been named. Whether the Vatican under Francis can finally put its own house in order may come to define a liberalising Papacy that has strived to refocus the Church on the needs of the poor. Meanwhile the Secretariat, now the owner of 122,000 square feet of prime London real estate, is exposed to the whims of Britain’s chaotic politics. “We have the bad effects of Brexit, a softer market,” says one insider. “The only way to ride out the storm is with strong hands”.

"Top five GAM shareholders nurse losses of $840m ","T Rowe Price, UBS, Credit Suisse, Kiltearn and Silchester hit by 80% fall in Swiss manager’s shares","The top five shareholders in GAM are sitting on losses of almost SFr835m ($840m) after a plunge in the Swiss fund manager’s share price following a tumultuous year.  The Zurich-listed group has been in the headlines for the wrong reasons since spring 2017. These have included being the target of an activist campaign, suffering a shareholder revolt over executive pay and two profit warnings. But the fallout from a whistleblowing saga, which claimed the scalp of bond trader Tim Haywood and led to the departure of chief executive Alexander Friedman, lies at the heart of the crisis that engulfed GAM last year.  Its shares have dropped 80 per cent since hitting a high of nearly SFr18 early last year with much of the fall occurring since the whistleblower saga became public in July.  GAM’s five biggest shareholders — Silchester International Investors, Kiltearn Partners, T Rowe Price and Swiss investment banks UBS and Credit Suisse — have lost about SFr835m, based on analysis of Bloomberg data and public filings. Together they own just under 36 per cent of GAM shares.  GAM’s problems lay bare an unpleasant reality for fund managers: that an unexpected crisis and sudden departures of key managers can leave them vulnerable, especially against a backdrop of low returns and pressure on fees.  The issues at GAM, which led to the biggest meltdown at a European asset management company since the financial crisis, are magnified because they coincide with a difficult period for all active asset managers as clients look at cheaper passive alternatives. Silchester, GAM’s top shareholder with a 19 per cent stake, has suffered a paper loss of close to SFr430m based on the difference between the 2018 high and Wednesday’s close of SFr3.55. At that depressed level GAM has a market value of SFr567m.  The London boutique is one of the biggest shareholders in several listed asset managers including Jupiter, Man Group and Janus Henderson. It keeps a low profile and has a reputation as a long-term investor. Chief investment officer Stephen Butt told the Financial Times last year that “asset management is a quiet, contemplative, diligent, long-term activity”.   Credit Suisse said it only held GAM shares on behalf of clients, which have collectively lost about SFr110m, and that the Swiss bank itself had not lost money.* Kiltearn, an Edinburgh-based manager, has lost a similar amount based on public filings of its holdings.  T Rowe Price, the US investment manager, is also listed as a top-five shareholder by Bloomberg. It has suffered a paper loss of about SFr95m, while UBS is nursing losses of close to SFr90m.  Silchester, UBS, T Rowe Price and Kiltearn declined to comment. The FT this week reported exclusive detail of the dispute within the team running GAM’s Absolute Return Bond Funds range, which triggered the whistleblowing. Daniel Sheard, a co-manager of the ARBF range, raised concern internally and later with the Financial Conduct Authority over investments made by Mr Haywood.  GAM stunned the market in July when it suspended Mr Haywood and announced that he might have failed to do sufficient due diligence, had breached the company’s gifts and entertainments policy and used personal email for work purposes.  The subsequent panic by investors to claw back their assets forced GAM to freeze redemptions from its ARBF range. GAM has said it found “no material client detriment” and that Mr Haywood did not breach the funds’ rules by holding the assets.  It is rare for an asset manager to collapse but a sudden calamity can spook investors, trigger outflows and leave a group struggling to recover. “[Going bust] is the wrong term. It could be a wind-down candidate,” says one analyst who wishes to remain anonymous. “You lose assets, you close the fund, you fire the management team. If they cannot stop the outflows it will be a managed decline.” GAM could enter “a downward spiral”, he says, if recent events cause asset owners such as pension funds to question whether they should invest.  The rush out of the ARBF range triggered by Mr Haywood’s suspension also highlighted key person risk, where the exit of a top manager causes redemptions. “[When] managing an asset management company you are very dependent on very strong personalities — fund managers have to have a high conviction in their ideas,” says a former senior GAM employee. “There are structural trends that are not favourable,” says Tomasz Grzelak, a former analyst at Baader Helvea. “If these things were happening in a boom market, they would be fine. The mood of investors would be good, there wouldn’t be many redemptions. In some ways they’re still at the mercy of the markets.” David Jacob, acting chief executive of GAM, insists the group can survive and eventually thrive. “We’re doing all we can to return this business to growth,” he told the FT as he unveiled a restructuring plan in December. However, eight months after the scandal broke no line has been drawn under the affair. Mr Haywood was dismissed for “gross misconduct” in February. He claims he is a scapegoat and is to challenge his dismissal. The group says liquidation of the ARBF funds is expected to conclude in the next few months.  “The organic recovery story at GAM looks likely to be gradual,” says Haley Tam, analyst at Citi. She adds that GAM still has “attractive areas of investment specialism”, such as in emerging market and real estate debt. “These should be useful engines for future growth, or attractive features for any potential acquirer.” Additional reporting by Chris Flood and Ralph Atkins * This article was revised on March 22 to state expressly that Credit Suisse itself has not lost money","22.03.2019"
"China’s banks surge into ‘perps’ market to bolster capital","Beijing wants lenders to build defences against downturn as trade war lingers","China’s banks are racing to issue domestic perpetual bonds as they seek to top up capital levels to meet tighter regulations, with about Rmb810bn ($114bn) worth of debt issued or in the pipeline. The embrace of “perps” — bonds with no maturity date, which qualify as loss-absorbing capital — is part of an effort by Beijing to shore up the nation’s financial system as the economy loses steam, and after a crackdown on the “shadow” banking sector, in which many banks had invested, put several under stress. The need for Chinese banks to raise capital has intensified in recent months as Beijing, still grappling with a trade dispute with the US, counts on domestic lenders to stimulate growth. “Chinese regulators want banks to cut shadow banking investment and increase traditional lending,” said Nicholas Zhu, an analyst at rating agency Moody’s in Beijing. “That requires capital that lenders couldn’t sufficiently generate from their retained earnings.” In January, Bank of China became the first Chinese lender to issue Rmb40bn in perpetual bonds with a 4.5 per cent coupon. Since then, eight lenders — ranging from industry leaders such as ICBC to regional players such as China Bohai Bank — have followed suit, taking the total to Rmb410bn. Momentum is expected to continue with eight more banks preparing to raise up to Rmb400bn by issuing perpetuals, according to company reports. The capital shortage in the sector is reflected in an FT analysis of 33 listed Chinese banks, using data from Wind Financial. This shows 21 of them — including the big four state lenders — fell short of capital requirements set out by global regulators, as at the end of the second quarter this year. “Our capital ratio is among the lowest in the global banking sector,” said a Bank of China director involved in the lender’s perpetual bond issuance, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We need to lift it to the industry average.” In the past, Chinese banks relied on issuing preference shares to improve their capital levels. But this avenue is limited to listed lenders and there are many unlisted lenders that are undercapitalised. Preference share issuance also suffers from a lengthy approval process and a lack of liquidity, say bankers. Perpetual bonds, which qualify as additional tier one capital as they have no incentive on the issuer to redeem, offer an alternative for banks seeking to shore up their capital base. The security is available to public and private lenders, which makes it a powerful financing tool for small banks which have limited access to external funding.  Perps also come with a feature called central bank bill swap (CBS) that helps improve the instruments’ liquidity. The feature allows dealers to temporarily swap perpetual bonds for central bank bills and to use the latter as collateral to obtain cheap credit. “CBS is giving perpetual bondholders the highest possible collateral they can get,” said Zhao Wenzhe, an economist at Credit Suisse in New York. The Bank of China director said perpetuals carry low risk despite the threat of a write-off, which is triggered when the issuer’s capital ratio drops below a certain level. “If we end up writing off the security, everyone else will default as well,” said the banker. Not everyone in the market is convinced. A Shanghai-based asset manager said he would not consider buying bank-backed perpetuals as the security offers a similar and, in some cases, lower return than traditional bank bonds despite a higher risk of default. Perps rank behind most debt securities in the priority for collecting repayment, in the event a bank goes bust. “Perpetuals could neither offer upside potential like stocks, nor security like bonds,” said the investor. “I don’t see a reason to hold them unless they offer a very high yield.” Investors agree that the potential influx into the perp market of smaller banks, which are more susceptible to economic dips, would require greater scrutiny. “It is difficult to predict when small issuers may run into trouble,” said Qi Sheng, an analyst at Zhongtai Securities in Shanghai. “You need to have particularly strong credit analysis capability.”  The CBS operation also opens up the question of state intervention, as it would allow Beijing to inject liquidity directly into the financial system. The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, has shrugged off that idea, saying it will keep perpetuals off its balance sheet while leaving credit risks to commercial banks. But analysts have doubts. Credit Suisse’s Mr Zhao said the central bank would have little trouble tweaking its rules if necessary. “If a financial crisis hits China, the PBoC could easily turn debt swap into an official purchase of securities in order to increase credit supply,” he said. “We are not there yet. But the central bank has created the mechanism that allows it to do so.”","18.09.2019"
"Pictet targets Asia as wealth managers battle for ultra-rich","New senior partner Renaud de Planta says headcount and revenues set to double in region","Swiss asset manager Pictet aims to double its assets in Asia in the next decade as wealth managers compete for a share of the increasing number of ultra-wealthy individuals in the region. The group plans to double staff in the Asia-Pacific region from a current headcount of 470 and has ambitions to double revenues, currently around 10 per cent of the group’s total SFr2.6bn, to 20 per cent by 2030, new senior partner Renaud de Planta told the Financial Times.  The number of Asian millionaires has grown almost 80 per cent since 2011, overtaking the US in 2015 as the region with the most so-called high net worth individuals, according to the CapGemini World Wealth Report.  Wealth managers have been battling to service the new ultra-rich in Asia, with UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, and rival Credit Suisse both making the region a priority. Julius Baer has also been expanding aggressively in Asia in recent years.  Mr de Planta estimated that private wealth in Asia currently accounts for just under a third of the global total, but that this will rise to 40 per cent over the next decade, which he said was “an enormous shift”. “It will be difficult for any firm like ours that wants to be global not to grow in Asia,” he said. Mr de Planta also said that Pictet — which has never made an acquisition in its 214-year old history — would consider opportunities if they arose to aid expansion in the region, though these are likely to be small and the focus will be on organic growth.  In addition to five existing financial centres in the Asia-Pacific region, Pictet is “close” to submitting an application to open a centre in Shanghai, which would be its first in mainland China. The push into Asia comes as Mr de Planta takes up the reins as senior partner, the 22nd to lead the group since Pictet was founded in 1805. Nicolas Pictet is stepping down after three years in the role.  All seven partners at Pictet, which is Switzerland’s third-largest wealth manager by assets behind UBS and Credit Suisse, are men. Mr de Planta said that recruiting a woman was a priority.  One of the most recent partners to join Pictet was Boris Collardi in 2018, who was formerly chief executive at Julius Baer, and who told Singapore’s Business Times in July that Pictet was “not where it should or deserves to be in Asia”.","02.09.2019"
"Stocks to watch: HSBC, Cairn Energy, Drax, Informa, William Hill","Merrill Lynch predicts an Aston Martin profit warning and a cash call","Monday 13:00 GMT What’s happening ● HSBC slipped on weaker than expected earnings and a cautious outlook statement that abandoned 2020 targets. Third-quarter adjusted profit before tax was 6 per cent below consensus expectations at $5.35bn as worse than expected revenues and credit losses were only partly offset by better costs. A deteriorating environment for revenue meant HSBC scrapped a target of delivering at least an 11 per cent return on tangible equity, though consensus forecast had already anticipated the miss.  Management also announced a strategic review due by the time of full-year results, saying parts of the group such as in continental Europe and its UK non-ringfenced bank were not generating returns worth the capital they consumed. The review “could result in significant [goodwill] impairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and beyond”, said Credit Suisse.  ● Cairn Energy slipped on news that a tribunal investigating its long-running dispute with the Indian government over a $1.4bn tax refund was not expected to conclude until summer 2020, between six and nine months later than previously hoped. The oil explorer also announced its first well offshore Mexico was dry. Morgan Stanley called the tax case “a wild card for Cairn’s net asset” with a value of between 0p and 200p a share. On the failure in Mexico, RBC said the prospect “was a key well in an important new basin for Cairn that could have added around 30p per share to our valuation”. Sellside stories ● HSBC upgraded Drax, the power station owner, from “hold” to “buy” with a 360p target price.  The upgrade came after the European Commission last week confirmed that a UK power capacity market scheme complied with EU state rules. The European Court of Justice had ordered the suspension of the capacity market in mid November to review its legality. Companies that missed out on historical payments would be refunded, the UK government said. “This is a significant reduction in 2019 earnings uncertainty for Drax,” said HSBC. The £75m of 2019 capacity payments due to the company compared with an operating earnings target of about £410m, the broker said. The return of the capacity market would also clear the fog around Drax’s expansion plans, in particular whether a new fleet of gas-fired turbines would be economic, it added.  ● Merrill Lynch downgraded Aston Martin from “neutral” to “underperform” with a 400p target price. It said to expect a warning from the automaker at third-quarter results, saw longer-term guidance as unachievable and noted that a rights issue was looking inevitable.  Weak near-term demand has hit Aston Martin’s profitability and another cut to margin guidance “looks very likely”, said Merrill. As well as a tough macroeconomic environment, Merrill cited competition from Porsche’s recently relaunched 911 and argued that Aston Martin’s DB11 and Vantage cars were “already showing a mid-cycle ageing”.  It forecast Aston Martin to deliver a 4.3 per cent earnings before interest and tax margin this year, compared with the company’s own guidance of 8 per cent and a consensus expectation of 6.2 per cent. That meant, ahead of Aston Martin’s third-quarter results, the broker cut 2020 and 2021 earnings forecasts by up to 50 per cent. Aston Martin’s recent debt sale revealed “significant liquidity issues” with the automaker agreeing an interest rate of about 15 per cent, Merrill said. Another $100m drawdown contingent on securing 1,400 orders for its soon-to-launch DBX model, “is only a temporary fix”, added the broker. “Aston may need to raise more equity in 2021.”  Further cash burn expected in the coming years meant Aston Martin’s net debt should rise to £1.1bn in 2021, or 3.5 times adjusted trading profit, Merrill said, adding: “With significantly increased leverage, we think the company would not be well positioned for any external shock with close to no more borrowing capacity.” Trading at an enterprise value of 1.6 times 2020 sales and 15.4 times adjusted earnings, Aston Martin might look cheap versus sector peers such as Ferrari but “much weaker financials and execution” made the comparison wrong, said Merrill. “[With] another tough set of results, significantly higher cash burn and likely very low guidance, when 2020 guidance is first set, the name will see further downgrades,” it said.  ● Goldman Sachs downgraded Informa, the publishing and events group, from “neutral” to “sell” with a 723p price target. Businesses across industries “are facing an inflection point in the mainstream adoption of data analytics tools”, said Goldman. Informa’s current suite of intelligence and analytics products are “still at an early stage and skewed towards end-markets that are facing their own structural challenges.” Informa therefore requires another investment cycle that will temper margin expansion in the medium term, particularly as the benefit of synergies from its 2018 merger with UBM reduce, Goldman said. Softer macro conditions and trade tensions also made Goldman “incrementally more negative” on growth from exhibitions, which provided 39 per cent of Informa’s total revenue last year. The broker also argued that Informa’s high level of debt would hinder its ability to make acquisitions, particularly as it would be competing with private equity players for data and analytics companies.

"Cost of Thomas Cook collapse becomes clearer","Bill for refunded bookings, repatriations and compensating hotels likely to be more than £500m","Thomas Cook’s collapse could land the government and the travel industry’s insurance scheme with a bill of more than £500m, according to official estimates. The government has said that the cost of refunding future bookings under the Air Travel Organiser’s Licence (Atol) scheme will be around £420m, in addition to tens of millions owed to hoteliers and an estimated £100m bill for chartering 1,000 flights to return Thomas Cook customers to the UK. That would eclipse the amount available through the Atol scheme. In its most recent accounts, the Atol’s parent fund, the Air Travel Trust, reported net assets of £170m and a £400m insurance policy, making a total of £570m it could call on.  The financial fallout from the liquidation of Thomas Cook has rapidly spread through the market this week, hitting lenders, suppliers, partners and landlords of its high-street shops. Banks including Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Scotland are facing writedowns of up to £1.8bn from the failure of Thomas Cook.  Estimates compiled by AlixPartners before the UK travel group collapsed, which have been seen by the Financial Times, showed that as little as £138m would be recovered for the lenders out of the £1.9bn debt they had provided. People close to the banks said even that previous “low-case” scenario was now unlikely, meaning the banks and bondholders would probably need to write down almost the entire amount. Bondholders are expected to write down £900m-£1bn, and the lenders £550m-£825m, with one person with knowledge of the debt position admitting this would likely be “at the higher end of the range”. Meanwhile MPs announced on Thursday that they would hold an inquiry into the company’s collapse focusing on its accounting practices, executive pay, and the role of its auditors. The business, energy and industrial strategy committee said it would seek to question Thomas Cook’s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, as well as its chairman, finance director and auditors. “The collapse of Thomas Cook has uncovered what appears to be a sorry tale of corporate greed, raising serious questions about the actions of Thomas Cook’s bosses and their stewardship of the business,” said Rachel Reeves, chair of the committee. One person close to the insolvency process said the travel group’s assets were “depressing”. Thomas Cook’s 40 UK aircraft have an average age of around 11 years and its retail estate consists of secondary and tertiary leases on already struggling high streets. Most value is likely to be realised from the airline slots, in which operators including Virgin Atlantic and Wizz Air have signalled an interest, and the brand itself. Norway’s biggest bank, DNB, which took a NKr1bn ($110m) writedown relating to Thomas Cook this week, and UniCredit were two of the larger lenders to the travel group’s revolving credit facility. Others lenders exposed include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Lloyds, RBS, Société Générale, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. Lloyds made a provision for exposure to the company in its first-half results, although did not say how much, given it was deemed “non-material”. The banks, some of which were blamed in part by Thomas Cook insiders for not doing more to help save the group during its restructuring talks, either declined to comment or did not respond to request for comment.  Alongside a majority of bondholders, the banks had been prepared to see their debts converted into £450m of equity in the tour and airline businesses — but Thomas Cook then struggled to meet a request for an additional £200m in equity from some of the banks.  Two people close to the insolvency proceedings said they expected Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate that owned 18 per cent of Thomas Cook until it folded, to be interested in buying the brand. “It’s an industry they want to play in,” said one. Thomas Cook’s hotel assets could also release some capital. LMEY, a real estate company that launched a £150m hotel fund in a joint venture with Thomas Cook in 2018, said it was looking to buy out Thomas Cook’s 42 per cent stake. “We will buy for sure Thomas Cook’s stake,” said Hans Kortlevers, founder of LMEY, adding that the company was looking for a partner to run the hotels.

"Stocks to watch: Barratt, Dunelm, Burberry, IQE, Hiscox, IP Group","Drug pipeline progress makes GlaxoSmithKline a buy, says SocGen","Wednesday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Barratt Developments faded on full-year results from the housebuilder that provided few surprises.  Profit, net cash and the dividend had already been reported in a July trading update so the focus was on cautious guidance for completions, which Barratt said would be at the lower end of the 3 per cent to 5 per cent medium-term target. Barratt also tempered expectations for current-year net cash to reflect tax, land purchases and a reduction in creditors. Peel Hunt downgraded Barratt from “add” to “hold” in response. “While there is plenty of uncertainty being caused by domestic politics it doesn’t seem to have had a major impact on recent sales reservations. The shares have had a great run in the year to date, comfortably surpassing peers due to a better margin performance. As a result the shares are now trading on a modest premium to the sector which looks about right.”Peel Hunt ● Dunelm retreated from an opening gain to lead the FTSE 250 fallers after a cautious outlook overshadowed in-line results. The soft furnishings retailer said full-year profit before tax was up 23 per cent, matching guidance given in a July trading update. But management cautioned over political uncertainty surrounding Brexit, drawing a parallel to tough trading around the 2016 referendum, and highlighted that the October 31 deadline to leave the EU was in the run-up to its peak winter season.  While consensus forecasts were not changing, Dunelm’s premium rating looked vulnerable given like-for-like sales were likely to normalise from 10.7 per cent on average in the last financial year, said analysts. Morgan Stanley highlighted that, assuming earnings per share of 51.9p in the current year, Dunelm had been trading in excess of 16 times calendar 2020 earnings in a UK retail sector valued at 12.6 times earnings.  ● Prudential led the Hong Kong-reliant stocks higher after the territory’s chief executive Carrie Lam formally withdrew an extradition bill that sparked three months of unrest in the city. Standard Chartered and luxury goods makers including Kering, LVMH and Burberry also gained.  Sellside stories ● Société Générale upgraded GlaxoSmithKline from “sell” to “buy” with a £22 target price.  “We’ve liked all the management and capital-allocation changes that new GSK chief executive officer (Emma Walmsley) has made during her first two years at the helm. But we have delayed upgrading our rating until now, as we wanted to see clear evidence of improving (internal and external) innovation within GSK’s unloved pharma business. After more than a decade of underperforming research and development productivity, we now expect five high-profile phase 3 assets to release results over the next three to four years. This pipeline progress means that we now forecast the group (both including and excluding the consumer business) to deliver above-average sales growth from 2023. We thus believe that a premium valuation is finally warranted.”SocGen ● Stifel downgraded IQE, the semiconductor materials maker, from “buy” to “hold” with a 50p price target.  Near-term headwinds have resulted in a broad-based drop in demand that, because of IQE’s high leverage, have had a severe effect on margins, profit and cash generation, Stifel said. It highlighted that IQE’s recent first-half results missed expectations again, with trading profit £2m short of a consensus at £7m. The broker suggested waiting until 2020 or beyond to see if there was any abating of sales headwinds including weak smartphone demand and inventory destocking. Apple’s unveiling of new iPhones next month may be a catalyst if there is an upgrade to 3D sensing technology, which uses IQE-sourced wafers, but annual pricing declines would offset any increased demand, said Stifel.  ● In brief: Akzo Nobel rated new “sell” at Berenberg; Antofagasta cut to “sell” at Deutsche Bank; Aperam raised to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Assura cut to “hold” at Panmure Gordon; BHP raised to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Bankinter raised to “neutral” at UBS; Basler rated new “buy” at Jefferies; Beazley cut to “hold” at Canaccord; Boliden raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Computacenter cut to neutral” at UBS; Direct Line raised to “hold” at Canaccord; Eni cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Equinor raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Hiscox raised to “hold” at Canaccord; IP Group raised to “hold” at Jefferies; Isra Vision rated new “buy” at Jefferies; Lenzing raised to “hold” at Berenberg; Pharnext cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Sabre Insurance raised to “buy” at Canaccord; Suez raised to “hold” at Société Générale; Talgo raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Telecom Italia raised to “hold” at Berenberg; Teleperformance raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Veolia raised to “buy” at Société Générale; Wereldhave cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"BNP Paribas beats profit estimate as fixed-income division recovers","Investment banking arm saw revenues increase by 4%","BNP Paribas’ investment bank continued its recovery in the second quarter as profits at France’s biggest bank by market capitalisation were boosted by its fixed income trading operation. The lender on Wednesday reported that net profit in the second quarter beat expectations with a 3.1 per cent increase over the same period last year to €2.46bn. Revenues increased 0.2 per cent to €11.2bn. Analysts had expected net profit of €2.1bn and revenues of just under €11bn, according to Bloomberg. BNP’s shares were up 3.5 per cent by mid-morning in Paris. The bank said the results came as “economic growth remained positive in Europe but slowed down, implying expectations of a continued low interest rate environment”.  Maxence Le Gouvello Du Timat, an analyst at Jefferies, said: “The beat comes from all divisions, mainly on the revenue lines and a low cost of risk.”  But, “the bulk of the . . . beat” came from the investment bank where revenues were “9 per cent better than expected”, said Jean-Francois Neuez, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. BNP’s investment banking division reported that operating revenues increased 4 per cent compared with the same quarter last year, to €3.1bn. Pre-tax profit was up 6.2 per cent to €1.1bn. Revenues from fixed income, currency and commodity (FICC) trading were up 8.8 per cent over the same quarter last year to €793m, boosted by “good growth in forex, credit and primary issues despite a more challenging context for rates, in particular in Europe”. Equities trading revenues fell 14.3 per cent to €615m, however, hit by the low interest rate environment and “a high base in the same quarter last year”.  That pulled down overall global markets revenues, the main trading division, by 2.7 per cent. Revenues would have been only 1.2 per cent lower, stressed the bank, if the effect of the creation of a new capital markets platform was excluded.  BNP’s investment banking performance was less impressive than the first quarter, when corporate and institutional banking revenues rose 3.5 per cent and FICC revenues climbed 28.5 per cent, but the bank will welcome the continued forward momentum — particularly following the results of its large US rivals. Analysts at Credit Suisse had expected a “sluggish quarter” for the big European banks based on the results of their US counterparts. Across the Atlantic, FICC revenues fell 7 per cent on average, while equities were down 8 per cent, according to Credit Suisse data. Credit Suisse also posted a better than expected quarter in trading, with revenue rising 4 per cent versus an average fall of 8 per cent on Wall Street. Last week, UBS and Deutsche posted disappointing results more in line with US peers. In the final quarter of last year, BNP Paribas suffered what it called “extreme market conditions” that hit trading revenues and its ambitions to become a European investment banking champion. In response, the lender accelerated cost-cutting and slashed its financial targets.  Large-scale job cuts, such as those being undertaken at crosstown rival Société Générale, are not expected in corporate and investment banking, said people familiar with the bank. BNP’s common equity Tier one ratio — a measure of balance sheet strength — was at 11.9 per cent at the end of June, an increase of 20 basis points over the previous quarter and 10 basis points ahead of expectations.","31.07.2019"
"Goldman Sachs seeks majority stake in China joint venture","Latest foreign investment bank to apply for control after recent relaxation of rules","Goldman Sachs has applied to take majority control of a securities joint venture in China in a move that will bring the US investment bank closer to its goal of sole ownership of the company. China has in the past year expedited the opening of its financial sector to foreign companies, following criticism that the process has dragged on for far too long without allowing true market access. A number of banks have since applied. In December UBS became the first to receive the green light, with the China Securities Regulatory Commission approving its request to raise its stake in Beijing-based UBS Securities from 24.99 per cent to 51 per cent. Goldman holds 33 per cent of its joint venture in China, Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, which was launched in 2004 and is connected to powerful Chinese institutions and investors. The CSRC said it had received Goldman’s application to raise its stake on Monday.  Goldman plans to take full ownership of the company as soon as regulations allow, which would bring its China business in line with its operations in other parts of the world. Several other banks have moved to increase their holdings in their securities JVs to 51 per cent, with Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Nomura all submitting applications.  Credit Suisse said in April it had reached an agreement with shareholders but was waiting on government permission to launch. Goldman’s joint venture was the first of its kind when it was launched nearly 15 years ago. The deal was hashed out between Henry Paulson, then chairman and chief executive of the bank, and Fang Fenglei, one of China’s top private equity investors. Mr Fang has connections to some of the most powerful figures in Chinese politics, including vice-president Wang Qishan.  The JV is also partially owned by Legend Holdings, a group founded under the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1984 that went on to buy IBM’s personal computer unit in 2005. Its structure has allowed the foreign shareholders to exercise management control despite holding a minority stake. UBS struck a similar deal in 2006 when it bailed out Beijing Securities. Since then, no other JVs have ceded control to foreign parties. The process of taking majority control of a Chinese securities house is fraught with difficulties for foreign banks. To launch their businesses as majority shareholders, they must pass several long approval processes, something likely to drag into 2020 for many applicants. ","21.08.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Centrica, CYBG, Fresnillo, Aston Martin, JD Sports","Asos has own-brand problems that will take time to fix, says Berenberg","Tuesday 15:30 BST What’s happening ● Centrica hit a 20-year low after the British Gas owner cut its dividend by more than expected and set out a disposal plan including the sale of its upstream operations. Continued weakness in gas prices, US losses, nuclear outages, warm weather and the impact of the consumer energy tariff cap meant half-year earnings per share plunged 63 per cent.  Iain Conn said he was stepping down next year as Centrica chief executive. JPMorgan Cazenove analysts called Mr Conn’s exit “the key positive . . . broadly balanced by the litany of negatives strewn through the release”. “We continue to see no easy solution to Centrica’s many woes. Clearly, the company’s newly announced re-structuring plan . . . would take time to bear fruit and involves execution risks. In our view, disposals are also likely to result in material earnings (10-15 per cent on 2020 consensus earnings per share) and free cash flow dilution. Management’s comments implied to us that [dividend per share] growth was unlikely in 2020, with high uncertainty on DPS growth prospects beyond that.”Jefferies ● CYBG, the Clydesdale Bank owner, was the FTSE 250’s sharpest faller after reporting a drop in net interest margins and trimming its year-end guidance. Management blamed a refinancing of a large volume of mortgage redemptions, as well as flagging slower mortgage growth as it tightens lending criteria. The warning raised concerns that CYBG’s purchase of Virgin Money last year might erode profitability. Shaw and Partners, the Australian wealth manager, highlighted that CYBG’s average mortgage rate was 2.6 per cent in the first half but Virgin Money has been offering new mortgages at interest rates that are 80 basis points lower. “Mortgages represented 70 per cent of CYBG’s interest-earning assets in the first half,” it said. “If all mortgages are ultimately priced 80bp lower, then much more [net interest margin] decline can be expected.” ● Lufthansa led Europe’s airline stocks lower after its second-quarter results came with another warning that industry overcapacity was putting pressure on fares. As flagged by an earlier profit warning, unit revenues weakened at Lufthansa’s network business while its Eurowings budget brand and its cargo business were both lossmaking. Management stuck to its full-year guidance.  ● Fresnillo slumped after the bullion miner posted weaker than expected half-year earnings, due to costs that were above the guidance given in a profit warning last month, and slashed production targets. Negative free cash flow in the period meant Fresnillo’s dividend was cut 76 per cent and needed to be paid from debt.  Sellside stories ● Merrill Lynch downgraded Aston Martin Lagonda from “buy” to “hold” with a halved 700p target price.  Near-term balance sheet concerns overshadow the longer term growth story, said Merrill, which cut earnings forecasts by up to 40 per cent in response to Aston Martin’s profit warning last week. An equity raise of between £250m and £500m could solve liquidity concerns ahead of the maturity of its 2022 bonds, the broker said. However, the interest among Asian car companies in European marques such as Volvo and Daimler suggests Aston Martin may become a target for a strategic buyer, Merrill added. It said a bid might come from Investindustrial, the private equity firm that is company’s largest shareholder, by itself or with a partner. ● Berenberg downgraded Asos from “buy” to “hold” as part of a retail sector review. Primark owner AB Foods was the broker’s only “buy” recommendation.  “We have been bullish on Asos, despite wobbles earlier this year and weaknesses (gaps) in key management roles, as we were of the view that the major infrastructure upgrade that Asos is undertaking would soon bear fruit. While this upside risk remains, and Asos has begun to strengthen its management team, this may take some time and consecutive profit warnings and ongoing execution issues may be indicative of cultural weakness.In terms of product, at the first-half results, management flagged a disappointing performance from its own-brand product. This is an issue that appears to have been building for some time. While fashion retailers can experience economies of scale with regards to fabrics and shipping costs, we can now also see material risk of diseconomies of scale, stemming from the complexity of scaling the buying and merchandising process. These problems are far from insurmountable, but we would wait for evidence that Asos has tackled them, before recommending that investors should buy the shares.”Berenberg ● RBC Capital Markets started coverage of JD Sports Fashion with an “outperform” rating and 725p target price. “We view JD Sports as one of the few UK retail success stories overseas,” it said. “Our analysis suggests the market has underestimated its international expansion potential and the margin recovery opportunity for Finish Line in the US.” A purchase intentions survey of UK, US and German consumers suggested demand for sportswear should remain healthy, with the majority of preferring to visit multi-brand shops, RBC said. It forecast UK sales to hold steady and predicted an improvement in US margins as last year’s Finish Line acquisition benefits from store conversions and better buying, which the broker saw as JD Sports’ key competitive advantage. “A strong sourcing capability is key to the success of JD Sports. JD Sports employs very experienced buyers who are experts in their product fields. These buyers are very close to consumer trends and the consumers themselves. As a result of having the ability to source new and on-trend products, JD Sports is able to control its promotions, maximise full price sales and minimize the level of markdowns.”RBC ● In brief: Admiral rated new “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Direct Line rated new “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Domino’s Pizza cut to “add “at Peel Hunt; Fevertree cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Hastings rated new “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Philips rated new “buy” at Citigroup; RSA rated new “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Saga rated new “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Smart Metering rated new “buy” at Citigroup; Swiss Re rated new “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley.

"SoftBank reaps instant profit from Wirecard debt shuffle","Japanese conglomerate had agreed a Buffett-like investment in German group","SoftBank cut its exposure to Wirecard this week within hours of signing a strategic tie-up with the German payments company, in a move that could net the Japanese conglomerate a big profit while taking little risk. SoftBank announced in April that it had agreed to pour €900m into Wirecard, providing a vital vote of confidence in the Aschheim-based company that has faced controversy over its accounting. SoftBank did not purchase a stake in Wirecard, however. Instead it bought a convertible bond, a type of debt that can be repaid in stock rather than cash. Wirecard’s shareholders gave final approval to the transaction on Wednesday, while also formally signing a “strategic cooperation agreement” with SoftBank. The following day, Credit Suisse sold a new €900m Wirecard bond that is exchangeable for stock to a broad group of investors. The new deal effectively means that SoftBank has taken the money it invested off the table, in what SoftBank executives described as a “return optimisation” measure. SoftBank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Wirecard did not respond to requests for comment. A senior SoftBank executive told the Financial Times that the Wirecard trade was inspired by Warren Buffett Analysts at brokerage Stifel said that Thursday’s deal offloads the “economic risk” of the Japanese group’s bet on Wirecard, adding that the deal effectively allows SoftBank to make good on its April commitment “without having to provide funding”. SoftBank still has skin in the game, however, because Wirecard’s shares have rallied strongly since it announced the deal. The Japanese group has retained exposure to 3m shares — now worth around €450m — and can also profit on a further 3.9m shares up to a price of around €230 per share. Wirecard’s shares are currently trading at €149. The Wirecard investment was made through a special fund managed by SoftBank Investment Advisers, which manages the group’s influential $100bn Vision Fund. Capital for the deal came from SoftBank, some of its employees and Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s state investment company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mubadala is the second-biggest backer of the Vision Fund after Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Mubadala did not respond to requests for comment. A senior SoftBank executive told the Financial Times that the Wirecard trade was inspired by Warren Buffett, who has a record of making highly structured investments in seemingly troubled companies that then benefit from his reputation. Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought $5bn of preferred equity in Goldman Sachs during the height of the financial crisis, for example. This paid a hefty 10 per cent annual dividend and netted Mr Buffett billions of dollars of profit when the investment bank later bought back his stake. The so-called “repackaging” of SoftBank’s convertible bond was sold to investors at less generous terms than those the Japanese group extracted from Wirecard. While repackagings are relatively common for small deals, convertible bond investors and bankers said that it is unusual to see one conducted on such a large scale. SoftBank frequently makes use of equity derivatives such as those seen on its Wirecard trade, often as a way of employing leverage — raising debt against its stakes that can be deployed on other investments. For example, a so-called “equity collar” on shares in Chinese internet giant Alibaba helped SoftBank raise the funds to buy shares in Arm, the UK chip designer, before a takeover bid in 2016. SoftBank took profit on its Wirecard trade at a time when the group is coming under renewed scrutiny for its outsized bets on tech companies. Investors in SoftBank’s Vision Fund are braced for hefty writedowns on some of its investments. One of them, WeWork, has shelved its public listing while valuations for freshly listed Uber and Slack have tumbled. Wirecard said its cooperation agreement with SoftBank would allow both companies to “pursue global growth opportunities and synergy effects, including through the SoftBank ecosystem in the fields of digital financial services, data analysis and artificial intelligence”. *This article has been amended since original publication to clarify the potential profit SoftBank stands to make.

"Julius Baer: the Iq factor","To surprise on the upside, new chief must gather funds affordably","Can you people just give a man a break? The chorus of “Philipp who?” must be dispiriting for Philipp Rickenbacher, who Julius Baer this week appointed as chief executive. Shares in the Swiss bank and wealth manager have since fallen 4.5 per cent.  Mr Rickenbacher was not randomly hired after coming in to overhaul the photocopier. He has been at the Baer since 2004 and before that worked for McKinsey. Who did investors think Baer would appoint? The answer to that appears to come in two parts. First, “someone exciting” — a harsh verdict on all experts in custody and intermediaries. Second, “Iqbal Khan”. Mr Khan was head of international wealth management at Credit Suisse. According to industry scuttlebutt, he then asked his chief the brave question “where do you see my career in five years’ time?” The answer now includes neither Credit Suisse, nor Baer, to which Mr Khan was briefly linked.  Erstwhile chief executive Boris Collardi surprised investors in 2017 by resigning to become a partner at privately held rival Pictet. Baer shares have lost a quarter of their value since.  Shareholders had hoped an external hire would energise the bank. In February, caretaker boss Bernhard Hodler announced flat profits. Client assets fell and the bank abandoned a 64 per cent to 68 per cent cost-to-income target.  That positions Mr Rickenbacher nicely. Unlike Mr Khan, he has no great expectations to live up to. If half-year results are terrible later this month, it would be the icing on the cake.  To surprise on the upside, Mr Rickenbacher needs to gather funds affordably. Baer’s wealth management assets are just $379bn, compared with $1.4tn for Credit Suisse and $3.3tn for UBS. Acquisitions are one method, though competition is stiff. Another is to hire more relationship managers. Buying bad apples is the danger here. There are still plenty around in the semi-reformed industry that is private banking. Last October, a former Baer banker was jailed for 10 years in the US for money laundering. *This article has been amended for incorrect assets under management figures

"Stocks to watch: AstraZeneca, Tui, H&M, Auto Trader, Jupiter, Evraz","Man Group’s attractions should keep cash returns flowing, says Credit Suisse","Friday 11:00 GMT What’s happening ● AstraZeneca slumped after the drugmaker launched a $3.5bn equity issue as part of a deal to license half the rights to a cancer treatment from Daiichi at an upfront cost of $1.35bn, rising to $6.9bn depending on performance and milestones. Management guidance pointed to no effect on core earnings per share this year, followed by growing accretion from 2020. Daiichi’s drug is seen as a potential competitor to Roche’s franchise targeting the HER2 gene, which is linked to breast cancer. Analysts estimated a peak sales potential of $5bn in a market worth about $11bn a year. JPMorgan Cazenove said that while the collaboration was a “significant” positive for AstraZeneca’s pipeline, the equity raise was a surprise so soon before the company releases safety data for its anaemia treatment roxadustat.  “The fact that AstraZeneca is raising more than it needs for the Daiichi deal speaks to the strain that the company’s balance sheet is already under, and the fact that this strain isn’t going to be resolved organically. Secondly, because although the potential for an equity funded deal had been discussed at some length over the last year . . . we believe investors had got more comfortable that such a deal wasn’t going to take place.”JPMorgan Cazenove ● Tui dropped after warning of a €200m one-off cost from the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max fleet, which was much higher than investors had anticipated.  The guidance, which was expected to cut Tui’s full-year earnings by about 17 per cent, was based on the assumption that 737 Max flights would resume by mid-July. If planes remain grounded until the end of September the cost would be €300m, or a 26 per cent cut to 2019 earnings, said Tui. Press reports had put the cost of landing alternative aircraft at €3m a week, suggesting a cost to mid-July for Tui of closer to €50m, said Citigroup. Tui’s guidance was more wide ranging, taking in disruption costs and trading effects. “The bears may feel there is an element of padding in this number given the ongoing tough trading environment and Brexit uncertainty in particular and the share price weakness today suggests the market regards roughly half of the €200m cost as one-off. While this may seem like a harsh assessment we struggle to see investor sentiment improving on the stock until there is more clarity on peak summer trading.”Citi ● Hennes & Mauritz soared on better than feared first-quarter results. The Swedish retailer posted earnings per share of SKr0.49, its weakest in 18 years, but still better than a SKr0.33 consensus forecast thanks to fewer clearance sales delivering an unexpected improvement in gross margins.  On current trading, H&M said total sales on a constant currency basis were up 7 per cent so far in March. That improved on 4 per cent growth for the first quarter, which analysts said was likely to reflect favourable weather in western Europe. They also noted that H&M’s inventories were up a further 14 per cent. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse started coverage of Man Group, the hedge fund manager, with an “outperform” rating and 180p target price. “Man has strong differentiation in technology-enabled active investment management strategies. Its differentiated products should provide better net new money generation, better relative performance across market conditions and better defence against margin competition than traditional asset managers. Man has returned 50 per cent of its market capitalisation in the past five years and we think consensus is too conservative on first-quarter performance and future buyback assumptions.”Credit Suisse ● In brief: Accesso Technology upgraded to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Jupiter raised to “neutral” at UBS; Partners Group raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Ren raised to “hold” at Société Générale; Auto Trader cut to “hold” at Panmure Gordon; Beiersdorf cut to “sell” at Investec; Carl Zeiss Meditec cut to “reduce” at Commerzbank; Deutsche Telekom cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Evraz downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Osram cut to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Tele2 cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Lotus Bakeries rated new “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux Read more

"UK bankers to fight extradition to US over ‘tuna bond’ case","DoJ charged three Credit Suisse executives with fraud in connection with $2bn scandal","US prosecutors face a protracted extradition legal battle over three UK-based former bankers at Credit Suisse whom they have charged in connection with the $2bn Mozambique “tuna bond” scandal. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on Friday, lawyers said the defendants would contest the extradition request made by the US, where they are wanted for “large-scale fraud”, according to Mark Summers QC, representing the US government. The three former bankers were charged by the US Department of Justice in January with fraud and receiving kickbacks in connection with the hidden-loans scandal, which  centres on a 2013 deal for Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries, to borrow from international investors. Ostensibly this was to fund maritime projects, including a state tuna fishery, ahead of investments in offshore gas. The loans were partly concealed from the International Monetary Fund and donors before they collapsed and sparked a financial crisis amid signs that the projects were suspect. But the case could prove difficult for the DoJ, which has been stymied recently in other extradition cases by UK courts. The department already faces a legal challenge from Manual Chang, Mozambique’s finance minister at the time of the loan deals, who was arrested in South Africa in January in connection with the indictment and is fighting extradition to the US from there. Andrew Pearse, the former Credit Suisse banker who then went to work at Privinvest, an Abu Dhabi-based group that supplied boats and gear to the projects, will contest the case “on the forum bar, and possibly other grounds”, his barrister, Alex Bailin QC, told the London court on Friday. The so-called forum bar gives the court the ability to block an extradition if it deems the majority of the alleged criminality took place in the UK. It was extended by Theresa May, the prime minister, in 2012, when she was home secretary, in response to the perceived long arm of US justice. One recent case saw UK courts rebuff a US extradition request of a London-based HSBC banker charged with forex-rigging on such grounds.  Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in extradition and human rights, said the tuna-bond case would be “a test of how far US prosecutors can reach and exercise their power”. But successful forum-bar cases are still rare. According to Thomas Garner, an extradition specialist at the law firm Gherson, the key questions over the forum bar hinges on where the court deems the “centre of gravity of the case” to be, given that complex financial cases affected multiple jurisdictions. “It’s not just a case of saying, ‘I’m British, prosecute me here’. The forum bar was drafted in a very tight way and the factors the court has to consider are very narrow.” One of those factors is whether UK authorities have their own investigation into the same alleged conduct. The UK’s financial regulator did have a criminal money-laundering probe into the matter as well as a parallel regulatory one. The criminal investigation has been dropped because the Financial Conduct Authority said it did not have the requisite legal powers it felt were needed in the case, although its regulatory case remains.  The watchdog referred its file to the Serious Fraud Office for review, according to people familiar with the situation, but it is not clear whether the SFO has decided to take it up. The SFO did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. People familiar with the investigation told the Financial Times that the SFO has not contacted either Credit Suisse or the individual defendants On Friday, Mr Summers confirmed after the hearing that all three defendants — Mr Pearse, 49, Surjan Singh, 44, and Detelina Subeva, 37, are fighting the extradition request. Solicitors for Mr Singh and Ms Subeva declined to immediately comment after the hearing. The DoJ and Credit Suisse also declined to comment. All three defendants, who attended court on Friday, were bailed until their next hearing on March 29. Magistrates courts in extradition hearings do not determine whether defendants are guilty of the offences charged, merely whether they should be extradited to the country that has filed those charges.   The DoJ alleges that the three allegedly deceived investors over the loans’ true purpose and circumvented the bank’s internal controls to conceal the alleged fraud. The indictment accused the bankers of using personal emails to conceal their activities and misleading the bank over the nature of the companies behind the loans. On Thursday the DoJ revealed three additional defendants, including two former Mozambique government officials and an agent of Privinvest.  Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber in Washington

"Crédit Agricole falls after first quarter miss ahead of June strategy update","French mutual bank reported net profit below expectations","Crédit Agricole’s profits came in below expectations in the first quarter, despite a better than forecast performance in its investment banking arm, sending shares down as investors turned their eyes towards a strategy update due in June. The French mutual bank saw shares in its listed vehicle fall close to 3.6 per cent by midday in Paris on Wednesday after it reported net profit of €763m, below a consensus estimate of €820m and 10.9 per cent down on the same period last year.  The miss by Crédit Agricole was, said analysts at Citi, “mainly due to higher costs and higher taxes, with revenues broadly in-line and better provisions”. It was also due in part to a higher than expected contribution to the EU’s Single Resolution Fund during the quarter. Revenues in Italy dragged on the results, but analysts at Credit Suisse noted that the bank’s asset management division, Amundi, and its investment banking arm beat expectations. Fixed income, currencies and commodity trading saw revenues of €472m versus analyst consensus of €404m and equating to a 2 per cent increase over the previous year. That compared to a 10 per cent drop on average for the bank’s US peers. Credit Suisse added that they “would expect limited changes to forecasts ahead of the investor day on 6 June” when a new strategic plan is expected to be unveiled. The bank achieved the goals laid out in its current plan ahead of schedule and its shares, despite Wednesday’s fall, are up 16.5 per cent this year. The performance at Crédit Agricole’s investment bank follows that of French rival BNP Paribas which earlier this month saw revenues rebound at its corporate and investment banking business.  That contrasted with the final quarter of last year, when BNP Paribas suffered what it called “extreme market conditions” that hit its trading revenues and prompted both BNP and Société Générale to restructure their CIB operations. Crédit Agricole’s core tier-one ratio, a key measure of financial strength, came in flat at 11.5 per cent. The bank is buttressed by its wide French retail network.","15.05.2019"
"Credit Suisse returns to profit despite Asian trading losses","Investment bank drags on earnings, while wealth management and Swiss divisions show resilience","Credit Suisse swung to a profit in the last quarter, helping to break a three-year lossmaking streak as growth in wealth management and its Swiss home market overcame another disappointing performance by the bank’s trading business.  Chief executive Tidjane Thiam has transformed the 162-year-old Swiss lender since joining in July 2015, slashing its volatile and capital-intensive trading operations to expand the more profitable and predictable wealth management and private banking units, particularly in Asia.  However, the investment bank remains a persistent drag on earnings more than three years into his overhaul. Analysts said the bank’s pre-tax profits beat expectations in the fourth quarter, helped by cost-cutting, but its shares fell 1.8 per cent in mid-morning trading on Thursday. The Zurich-based lender reported a second consecutive quarterly loss in its struggling global markets trading operation, which was offset by increased profits and revenues in its wealth management and Swiss universal banking divisions. “There was a significant drop off in high-yield trading, leverage finance and the new issue pipeline” with the lack of deals “pretty much unheard of”. head of investor relations Adam Gishen said on a call with reporters.  “It was also really tough in Asian markets, we knew it was coming, but there was a very very significant fall off in client activity levels, they stepped away from market and took the opportunity to deleverage.” The bank’s Asian fixed-income sales and trading revenues fell 91 per cent, which it blamed on “the unfavourable trading environment”.  Executives reiterated that despite the repeated losses they did not plan to shrink the markets unit any further, arguing it could not get any smaller without losing credibility as a scale player or having a knock-on impact on earnings from ultra-wealthy clients, who use the division’s trading services. Its assets under management in wealth management fell only 2.1 per cent year on year and incoming net new assets were almost flat compared with $13bn of client outflows at UBS. * “While the Swiss bank and international wealth management did well, global markets disappoints again and posts revenues of less than SFr1bn in a quarter for the first time ever,” said Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti, who has called for the trading unit to be cut back further. The struggling global markets trading unit made a second-consecutive quarterly loss, losing SFr193m ($191m) in the period following SFr96m in the third quarter. It also made a SFr195m loss last year. The weak performance in trading mirrors that of European rivals, such as Deutsche Bank, UBS, BNP Paribas and Société Générale.  Group revenues fell 7 per cent in the quarter to SFr5bn, making it harder for the bank to achieve its profitability target, which is predicated on the measure remaining at least flat. Operating costs fell almost 18 per cent to SFr4.1bn in the quarter. “Overall, a solid result considering . . . peer group reporting, driven mainly by strong cost management in a difficult environment,” said JPMorgan Chase analyst Kian Abouhossein. “However, operationally there will be some questions with focus in particular on global markets.” Adjusted group quarterly pre-tax profit rose 49 per cent. Net income climbed to SFr292m in the final three months of 2018 — handily beating analysts’ expectations — compared with a loss of SFr2.1bn last year. On an annual basis, net income rose to SFr2.1bn from an overall SFr983m loss in 2017. The bank reiterated its goal to make a return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 10 to 11 per cent this year, despite posting a ROTE of 3 per cent in the quarter and 5.5 per cent for the whole of 2018. It also plans to buy back as much as SFr1.5bn of stock this year. “We experienced widespread volatility and lower activity levels across the market [in the fourth quarter],” said Mr Thiam. “This has improved so far this year, with signs of normalisation in the first six weeks of 2019, leading to a less negative trading environment . . . but [things are] still weaker than in the first quarter of 2018.” Mr Thiam, a former insurance executive and management consultant, has had a turbulent time at the Swiss bank, which made SFr6.7bn of combined net losses from 2015 to 2017 as it unwound risky leveraged trading positions, cut more than 10,000 jobs and paid big misconduct fines around the world. Last week the Financial Times reported the bank had frozen its 2018 bonus pool at SFr3.2bn, while awarding its top executives double-digit pay rises, as the board seeks to balance distributions to shareholders with pay for employees. *This article has been amended to remove an incorrect reference to Julius Baer’s outflows

"Wirecard rated just above junk by Moody’s as it launches €500m bond","Rating agency gives German fintech lowest possible investment grade classification","German financial technology group Wirecard has been rated just above junk status by rating agency Moody’s as it looks to issue a €500m bond. Moody’s assigned a Baa3 rating — the lowest investment grade classification — to both Wirecard generally and the planned unsecured notes specifically, citing constraints including the payment company’s size relative to US rivals and the “constant threat” of competition from new market entrants and technologies. But the rating agency also cited positives including Wirecard’s strong market position in Asia an Europe, its diversity, scalability and “sound financial profile”. “Wirecard’s Baa3 issuer rating reflects its leading position in the payment processing market, especially in Europe and in the strongly growing Asian markets and its comprehensive product portfolio in the highly competitive industry,” said Dirk Goedde, Moody’s lead analyst for Wirecard. Based out of Aschheim, Germany, Wirecard has grown rapidly in recent years, selling technology and knowhow used by businesses to take payments from customers. Its share price has been under pressure since late last year when it became embroiled in an accounting scandal.  Moody’s gave the group a stable outlook and said it expects it to generate growth in adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation in the “high-teens to mid-twenties” over the next 12-18 months It added that it does not expect Wirecard to exceed an adjusted debt to ebitda ratio of three times, including the new €500m bond and an “envisaged” €900m investment by Japan’s SoftBank via a convertible bond that was announced earlier this year.  Wirecard plans to begin a roadshow for the new five-year bond on September 2 to meet with fixed income investors. Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank and ING will act as global coordinators, while Citi and Credit Suisse will be active bookrunners.","29.08.2019"
"Rich people are hoarding cash, and wealth managers are getting frustrated","Irritation that clients think cash is safest bet in world of negative interest rates","A friend of mine has relatives in Germany who converted some of their not insubstantial family wealth into gold bars and buried them in the woods of Bavaria. This was at a time before negative interest rates so was not a reaction to today’s uncertain global economy, rather mistrust of the financial system in general. Yet it highlights a propensity on the part of the wealthy to hoard that is increasingly frustrating wealth managers. High-net worth individuals (HNWIs) — people with at least $1m in investable assets — are increasingly shunning equities. In the first quarter of this year, HNWIs held nearly 28 per cent of their portfolios on average in cash, according to the Capgemini World Wealth report. A year previously, that figure was 27.2 per cent. Overall cash holdings of clients at UBS, the largest wealth manager in the world, are now 26 per cent, according to its quarterly investor sentiment survey — up from 25 per cent at the start of the year. Credit Suisse’s chief executive Tidjane Thiam told analysts in July that clients were holding 29 per cent in cash — albeit a slight dip from 30 per cent at the start of 2019. Wealth managers say the uncertain environment for the global economy and the outlook for equities are why clients are keeping their powder dry. More recently, fears over the trade war between the US and China have led some investors to increase their cash holdings: a third of investors in UBS’s quarterly survey thought the skirmishes could last a year or longer, and while 45 per cent thought diversifying their portfolio was the best solution to a prolonged trade war, 37 per cent said holding cash was the answer. Wealth managers do not like this trend, for understandable business reasons. Swiss banks in particular, where interest rates are negative at -0.75 per cent, have been passing on these rates to clients with high cash balances. Credit Suisse and UBS had held fire, but recently said they would have to start passing them on, too. If rich people do more with their money — investing in private equity or other alternative assets, buying property or even regularly trading equities, for example — wealth managers make more money from them. 3.9%The fall in the number of ultra-HNWIs around the world in 2018 To give them their due, it is not all about their bottom line. Some wealth managers are genuinely frustrated that clients think cash is the safest bet in a world of negative interest rates. “In some ways it is heartbreaking to think about how much the markets have moved since the financial crisis,” UBS chief investment officer Mark Haefele told me recently, referring to investors who have stayed on the sidelines and missed out on the great bull run in equities. Yet perception of risk is an emotional thing. If people feel comfortable paying extra money in the form of negative rates for the known loss they will suffer on cash versus the unknown and potentially larger loss on riskier assets, it can be hard for wealth managers to talk them out of it. At least, unlike gold bars buried in the ground, finding where their money is will not be a problem, so in that respect the cash-rich could be doing worse in terms of portfolio protection. Wealth managers may need to respect that.    Capgemini Global HNW Insights survey Only 44% of HNWIs interviewed for the 2019 Capgemini Global HNW Insights survey said they connected ‘very well’ with their wealth managers
“My wealth manager does not know me well personally”
28% cited their adviser’s lack of emotional intelligence as the reason they did not connect well
“My wealth manager uses too much technical lexicon that is difficult to understand”

Boris Johnson will on Wednesday submit a formal Brexit proposal to the EU after closing the Conservative party conference in Manchester, with allies saying they could know “by the weekend” whether Brussels will accept plans to resolve the vexed Irish border issue. Mr Johnson is pinning his hopes on Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, to present a British proposal as the basis of a deal and declare the controversial “Irish backstop” dead. The UK prime minister also joined a pledge to tone down language after last week’s furious scenes in parliament sparked public outrage. But Mr Johnson faces resistance from opposition leaders, who agreed on Monday to seize the parliamentary agenda to force the disclosure of government Brexit planning documents. Swirling rumours about the influence of Tory financial backers hoping to profit from a no-deal withdrawal also received a dose of cold war. At the Tory conference, chancellor Sajid Javid announced plans to raise Britain’s minimum wage to the highest in the developed world amid efforts to abandon longstanding Tory mantras of low public spending. Robert Shrimsley writes that Mr Johnson’s snarling conservatism speaks to a “one nation” of small-town, patriotic and northern voters — and targets a common enemy.

"Tech crunch could herald US ‘earnings recession’","Quarterly results from US blue-chips could show second successive fall in profits","Equity investors are bracing for a second successive drop in US quarterly profits, led by the technology and materials sectors, that could undermine a record-breaking run in the stock market.  Blue-chip companies across America are expected to reveal a 2.8 per cent drop in earnings per share for April to June, following a first-quarter contraction of 0.3 per cent, according to FactSet data. If this happens, the two back-to-back quarters of shrinking earnings would constitute an “earnings recession” — a phenomenon equity investors have not witnessed since mid-2016. Contracting corporate earnings would underscore concerns over US economic growth, coinciding with the trade dispute with China and recent disappointing manufacturing data. The end of the decade-long US expansion could prompt investors to reduce risk by shifting assets into bonds to weather a downturn. Despite the first-quarter earnings contraction, US shares have continued to soar. Last week the S&P 500 index of US companies touched 3,000 points after comments from Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell reinforced the market’s view that the central bank will clip interest rates later this month. Technology stocks appear particularly vulnerable to a drop in earnings. Analysts estimate earnings per share at tech companies will shrink by just over 7 per cent on average compared to the second quarter last year, tying with materials as the worst sector by earnings growth forecasts, according to Credit Suisse.  The tech sector — which, after an index reshuffle, no longer includes social media groups such as Facebook and Google’s parent company Alphabet and is instead dominated by hardware companies — is suffering a squeeze on its profits due to a tightening labour market, according to Goldman Sachs. Labour costs amount to about 16 per cent of revenues for the information technology companies, the second highest level after the industrials sector, according to the bank. “The margin pressure for large tech companies is what is driving the drop in earnings,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist for Credit Suisse. “There is earning pressure but it’s not universal — it’s being felt among a few companies, but they happen to be very large.” Not all analysts are convinced earnings will fall. US companies typically offer dire guidance to prompt analysts to lower earnings predictions — creating a low bar that is easy to surpass when results are officially released. This occurred in the first quarter, when predictions of a 4.6 per cent drop in earnings based on company guidance eventually became a 0.3 per cent drop. The impact of share buybacks will also soften the impact of lower earnings on a per share basis. Company stock repurchases remove shares from the market, so earnings are spread across fewer shares. First quarter stock buybacks for S&P 500 companies hit $205bn and if the pace continued in the second quarter, companies will be on course to surpass last year’s record $806bn. Weaker corporate earnings comes as disappointing economic data signal a cooling US economy, said Mr Palfrey of Credit Suisse. “We don’t see a recession coming in the next few years but we are cautious,” he said.

"Short sellers pile into WeWork debt","More than 10% of property group’s bonds now on loan — the most on record","Investors have placed a record level of bets against WeWork’s bonds since the lossmaking property group abandoned its initial public offering and its credit rating was slashed deep into junk territory. More than $67m of the company’s $669m of corporate debt was on loan, according to data provider IHS Markit. This is a proxy for “short positioning” in the bond, where investors profit if the price of the debt declines. WeWork’s bonds, which mature in 2025, have fallen dramatically in recent weeks. The debt traded hands for less than 85 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, a record low. That was down sharply from a high of 105 cents on the dollar after WeWork made public its IPO plans in August. By Thursday morning, they had edged just above 85 cents. “It makes sense as a ‘pile on’ trade,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. “All the sentiment, all the headlines have been bad. It’s led to a feasting on a failed unicorn.”  WeWork’s bonds now offer a nearly 12 per cent yield to maturity, just short of the average yield on a Credit Suisse index of triple C-rated high-yield debt. On Tuesday, Fitch Ratings had cut WeWork’s credit rating by two notches to triple C plus with a negative outlook. Under Fitch’s definition of triple C, bonds carry “substantial credit risk” and default is seen as “a real possibility”. Short sellers borrow debt — often from banks — for a fee and then sell it into the market. If the bond price declines, they are then able to buy the bond back at a lower price. The short seller then returns the bond to the bank, pocketing the difference between their purchase and sale prices. Sam Pierson, a director in IHS Markit’s securities lending division, noted that the cost to borrow WeWork debt to short had skyrocketed and that it was now among the most expensive bonds to short in the $9.5tn US corporate debt market.  More than 10 per cent of WeWork’s debt was now on loan, according to the IHS Markit data, eclipsing a period last year when the company was expected to win new financing from SoftBank, news that drew a large number of short sellers into the debt. The company earlier this year repurchased $33m of the $702m bond, according to filings with US securities regulators. WeWork has been in turmoil since it pulled the plug on its hotly anticipated IPO last month and co-founder and chief executive Adam Neumann stepped down from his role at the head of the company. Institutional investors have raised serious concerns over the company’s business model, Mr Neumann’s sway over the company and his share sales. The two executives installed to take up his post — Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham — are now at work to secure a new financial lifeline for the office space provider.  The company had planned to raise at least $3bn in its now-aborted listing and a further $6bn through a loan from a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. But that debt package was contingent on the IPO, and WeWork parent the We Company is now negotiating a far smaller loan from the group of banks, according to people briefed on the matter. In a bid to solidify its finances, WeWork is considering selling off companies that it has recently acquired, including Managed by Q, Meetup, Conductor, SpaceIQ and Teem, as well as its stake in The Wing.  It has also dramatically slowed its pace of new lease signings, and last week temporarily halted the signing of new property contracts. The company has burnt through capital as it has expanded from its founding in a single office in New York’s SoHo district to more than 500 locations. Credit-rating agencies have swiftly cut their views of the company and warned creditors of the stresses on WeWork’s balance sheet. Analysts at Fitch warned it was likely WeWork had $1.5bn of cash at the end of the third quarter, down $1bn from the end of June, and that it faced “material restructuring cash charges”. The company is expected to lay off thousands of its employees in the coming weeks.","03.10.2019"
"Banks and advisers to land £200m in fees on Cobham sale","Bulk of charges relate to debt financing on £4bn deal for UK defence group","Banks and other advisers are set to make more than £200m in fees if the £4bn takeover of Britain’s aerospace and defence contractor Cobham is successfully completed by private equity group Advent International. The fee arrangements were set out in documents released on Wednesday ahead of a shareholder vote on the deal next month.  The proposed takeover of one of Britain’s oldest engineers has faced a backlash from parts of the country’s political establishment over concerns about the sale of leading defence intellectual property to a foreign buyer.  Nadine Cobham, whose late husband Michael Cobham ran the FTSE 250 group and who was the son of the founder Alan, has urged the government to intercede, arguing the deal, which has the backing of the board, is not in the “national interest”. Cobham’s pioneering air-to-air refuelling technology is used on all western fast jets and is regarded by many as a national strategic asset.  “It is very odd that the UK has a company that has 90 per cent of the global air-to-air refuelling market and doesn’t want to keep it, particularly as that technology is a strategic asset,” Lady Cobham told the Financial Times.  The documents published on Wednesday revealed that the bulk of the fees from the deal — between £120.2m and £135.2m — would be incurred from the financing of the debt on the transaction. Advent is financing the purchase through a combination of equity, totalling just over £1.2bn, and debt. Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are among the banks providing interim lending facilities.  Advent and Cobham’s respective financial and corporate broking advisers — Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Credit Suisse for Advent and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Cazenove and Rothschild & Co for Cobham — stand to share up to £45.8m.  The proposed fees are towards the top end of average fees paid to advisers in the UK on recent private-equity transactions, according to research by Dealogic. On average for listed sell side fees, Dealogic said it would expect them to be in the range of $25m-$29m. Cobham’s advisers and brokers are expected to receive £24m or $29m. The fees are smaller than those paid to advisers during last year’s hostile takeover battle of GKN, another British industrial group, by Melrose Industries. The Financial Times earlier this month disclosed that JPMorgan Chase is poised to collect the largest individual fee to a bank for selling a company, earning $123m for advising Allergan on a planned $63bn sale to US pharmaceutical group AbbVie.  Advent has so far secured the backing of investors holding 5.2 per cent of the stock, including Cobham’s management as well as Artemis Investment Management. Silchester International, Cobham’s largest shareholder which owns 11.83 per cent, has said the 165p cash offer was too low and urged the company’s management to find alternative proposals. Under the terms of the “scheme of arrangement”, Advent needs 75 per cent of shareholders to back its offer.  The proposed sale will test the appetite of Boris Johnson’s government for takeovers of key parts of Britain’s industrial base. Advent has pledged to maintain investment in Cobham’s research and development and production sites but concerns are rife about the loss of key defence technology.  Lady Cobham, whose family owns 1.5 per cent in the group, wrote to defence secretary Ben Wallace and business secretary Andrea Leadsom earlier this month. Mr Wallace has promised that he will look into the family’s concerns, saying he would consider the impact on “the security and skills” needed to protect the UK. ","21.08.2019"
"Mozambique sues Credit Suisse over tuna bonds scandal","Southern African nation launches court proceedings against the Swiss bank in London","Mozambique has launched London court proceedings against Credit Suisse and former employees of the Swiss bank implicated in the southern African nation’s $2bn “tuna bond” scandal. The case in the Commercial Court names 10 defendants, including Surjan Singh, Andrew Pearse and Detelina Subeva, the former Credit Suisse bankers who were criminally indicted by US prosecutors in January in connection with the bonds. The US indictment accused the trio of working with Mozambique’s former finance minister to siphon at least $200m in kickbacks from loans that were marketed to international investors in 2013 as backing a state tuna fishery and maritime security projects. While the debt to finance tuna boats was raised publicly, other loans arranged by Credit Suisse and Russia’s VTB were concealed from the IMF and international donors. The debts sent one of Africa’s poorest nations into a financial tailspin when they were fully uncovered in 2016. The US charges reignited pressure on Mozambique’s president Filipe Nyusi to repudiate the debts, rather than seek to restructure them after they were plunged into default by the scandal’s fallout. A forensic audit by Kroll found that at least $500m of the amount raised by the debt could not be accounted for. The Mozambican government filed its civil case on Wednesday, naming both Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse International as defendants, court records showed. Case documents were not available from the court. The London case is “hopefully an indication that the Mozambique government will declare the $2bn debt illegal so that the people of the country do not have to pay a debt they had no say over and no benefit from,” said Tim Jones of the Jubilee Debt Campaign. The launch of the London case came two days before Mr Pearse, Mr Singh and Ms Subeva were due in court for a hearing on a US request to extradite them from the UK. But that hearing has now been put back a week after the Home Office failed to receive key documents from the USA, according to a court official. Mozambique is also suing Privinvest, the Abu Dhabi-based shipbuilder that provided boats and equipment under the loans. An agent of Privinvest was indicted by the US alongside the ex-Credit Suisse bankers and Manuel Chang, the ex-finance minister of Mozambique who is fighting extradition to the US from South Africa. According to US prosecutors, as part of their alleged fraud the former bankers flouted due-diligence rules at Credit Suisse and fabricated the rationale even for the publicly issued tuna bond, which was later turned into fully fledged state debt. Mozambique has arrested Ndambi Guebuza, the son of its former president, over the scandal — as well as a former intelligence chief and the head of the tuna fishery who also ran two other companies linked to the loans. Mr Guebuza, who was remanded in custody, said his arrest was politically motivated. He and others who were arrested have not been tried. They are accused of mishandling funds and other offences. Credit Suisse declined to comment. The bank has been advising investors in some of the loans during the debt restructuring negotiations. A spokesperson for Privinvest said that the group and its associated companies had not yet been notified of the case and could not comment. Lawyers for Mr Pearse and Mr Singh declined to comment. A lawyer for Ms Subeva did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","28.02.2019"
"Credit Suisse freezes bonus pool after tough year of rebuilding","Swiss bank boosts senior executives’ pay after share price falls 30%","Credit Suisse has frozen its 2018 bonus pool while awarding its top executives double-digit pay rises, as it tries to keep investors onside when it reports higher annual pre-tax profits next week. The Swiss bank’s overall pool of bonuses will remain flat at about SFr3.2bn ($3.2bn) in the latest pay round as the board seeks to balance distributions to shareholders with pay for employees, according to people with knowledge of the decision.  However, its top executives are set to receive a significant pay boost worth tens of millions of francs after removing a voluntary cap on their pay imposed in the past two years. The move comes despite an almost 30 per cent fall in the bank’s share price in the past year. Credit Suisse has attracted controversy before over pay. The bank, led by chief executive Tidjane Thiam, was criticised by investors for boosting bonuses 3 per cent in 2017 and 6 per cent in 2016, despite making more than SFr3bn of annual losses during a painful restructuring over that period. This time the rewards will not fall evenly. Credit Suisse will continue the trend set in recent years of awarding its wealth managers and private bankers a larger slice of the pie to reflect their strategic importance to the group and higher profitability, the people said.  By contrast, the bank’s struggling traders will see their share of incentive pay fall after the global markets business abandoned its revenue target and posted a surprise loss in the third quarter. However, Credit Suisse’s M&A advisory bankers are expected to fare much better after generating more fee income last year. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. The situation is bleaker at Deutsche Bank, where investment banking staff are bracing for a double-digit fall in their bonus pool after the unit recorded one of its worst years since the financial crisis. At Credit Suisse, the top 12 managers on the executive board could earn a maximum combined SFr115m for their work in 2018 if they hit performance targets, up from SFr70m and SFr73m in 2017 and 2016 respectively. However, the amount actually awarded is expected to be less than SFr95m, one of the people said. Mr Thiam has said previously the bank had achieved 16 of its 17 main strategic objectives. Executives are judged on a range of factors such as the share price, return on equity and improvements to the company’s culture, according to its annual report. The bonus decisions were made this week by the compensation committee, led by non-executive director Kai Nargolwala, and will be formally signed off by the full board before Credit Suisse reports its annual results on February 14. Mr Thiam has dramatically reshaped the 162-year-old Swiss bank since joining from insurer Prudential in July 2015, refocusing on managing the wealth of the world’s ultra-rich while downsizing the unpredictable and capital-intensive trading arm. While there are green shoots, especially in Asian wealth management, and the lender has slightly mollified investors by starting a SFr3bn buyback programme, the shares have fallen more than 45 per cent under his leadership and the investment bank still weighs on results more than three years later. In a December strategy update, Mr Thiam guided that 2018 pre-tax profits would rise to between SFr3.2bn and SFr3.4bn, compared with SFr1.8bn the previous year and losses in 2016 and 2015.  However, the bank may be poised for a poor fourth quarter if its rivals’ results are an indicator. UBS blamed an economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions for $13bn of client outflows in wealth and asset management, while its investment bank swung to a loss after big falls in credit and equities trading. This week France’s BNP Paribas and Société Générale slashed financial targets and pledged to cut hundreds of millions of euros in investment-banking costs after reporting similarly poor markets performances. Even as Credit Suisse’s bonus pool has been gradually creeping back up in recent years, overall pay — which includes both salaries and bonuses — will fall to slightly less than SFr10bn in 2018 versus SFr16bn in 2011, the people familiar with the pay decisions said.  This is mainly because the bank has culled many of the expensive external contractors and consultants it previously relied on, bringing more roles in-house and replacing back-office staff with automated processes, they said. More than 85 per cent of top-earners’ compensation is in deferred shares, usually over three years, according to company filings. Two years ago, Mr Thiam and his top managers took a 40 per cent cut to their short-term bonuses and long-term incentive awards after shareholders and proxy advisers rebuked them for boosting their pay despite heavy losses. It also emerged that Credit Suisse paid its top investment bankers and traders almost SFr250m under a special scheme created to stop them jumping ship during the bank’s restructuring.  As a result, Credit Suisse’s remuneration report was approved by only 58 per cent of shareholders at its annual meeting in 2017, forcing the board to backtrack and slash executive payouts for two years. In the following year, however, 81 per cent of investors backed the bank’s pay report.","07.02.2019"
"Wirecard chairman dismisses calls for independent audit","Wulf Matthias calls discussion of payment group’s accounting ‘an annoyance’","Wirecard’s chairman Wulf Matthias has dismissed calls for an independent forensic audit of the German fintech group’s accounts, at the end of a week which saw its market value drop by more than a fifth. Mr Matthias said the group’s accountants appeared to be acting properly. “Prima facie, EY is evaluating the matters sufficiently,” Mr Matthias told the Financial Times. Wirecard has faced growing calls for an independent review of work by its auditor, EY, after the FT published documents on Tuesday that appeared to indicate a concerted effort to fraudulently inflate sales and profits. The company has categorically denied impropriety and said the conclusions drawn by the FT about the files were incorrect.  The 74-year-old — a former senior banker at Credit Suisse in Germany and other lenders — called the public discussion about Wirecard’s potential accounting issues “an annoyance”, adding that “we have endless stories [about Wirecard], three a day. I have not looked at them in further detail. We have other things to do.” Mr Matthias is due to step down as chairman of the supervisory board next year.  The comments came after Wirecard’s shares came under fresh pressure following an anonymous public letter to the group’s supervisory board members, warning them they could potentially face personal liability if they failed to investigate credible allegations of fraud. The letter was posted Friday on a website, MCA Mathematik, which unidentified short sellers have used in recent months to publish analysis of Wirecard’s financial statements and management commentary.  The FT could not immediately reach the five other members of Wirecard’s supervisory board for comment.  Wirecard’s shares dropped 6.3 per cent on Friday, to €111.65, taking the fall for the week to 21 per cent, despite the company announcing a €200m share buyback.  EY has declined to comment on its work for Wirecard, citing client confidentiality. In a statement published on Wednesday, Wirecard said “Wirecard’s group auditor Ernst & Young GmbH, Germany, confirmed that they have complied and will comply with all statutory and professional audit standards.”  Wirecard faced scrutiny this year as an accounting scandal unfolded in Singapore, where white-collar crime investigators are probing alleged accounting fraud and forgery.  After initially denying FT reports that the head of its finance team in the region was suspected of cooking the books at subsidiaries in the region, Wirecard admitted that some employees may face criminal liability, and announced a dozen new compliance measures. The company has said there was no material impact on its financial statements, and EY signed off on the group’s accounts for 2018.","18.10.2019"
"Jyske becomes first Danish bank to impose negative deposit rates","Decision comes as expectations for ultra-loose monetary policy pressure bond yields","Jyske Bank became the first Danish lender to introduce negative interest rates on deposits as a further sign of how the finance industry is expecting ultra-loose monetary policy to persist. Denmark’s third-largest lender said on Tuesday it would make customers holding more than DKr7.5m in deposits pay for them. The interest rate would be agreed individually but the default would be minus 0.6 per cent per year. “As Jyske Bank has a significant and increasing deposit surplus from personal clients and hence incurs large expenses in relation to these, Jyske Bank introduces a maximum of DKr7.5m on personal clients’ demand deposits with an interest rate of 0 per year,” said chief executive Anders Dam. Denmark has had sub-zero interest rates for longer than any other country with banks scrambling to adapt to the new reality. Danish lenders have offered negative interest rates on mortgages since 2015 and Jyske last week became the first to offer a 10-year home loan for minus 0.5 per cent. Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse have already signalled plans to levy negative interest rates on their wealthiest clients.","20.08.2019"
"Crédit Agricole raises profit target after reaching 2019 goal early","French mutual group seeks net income above €5bn by 2022 for listed arm","Crédit Agricole has laid out higher profit targets as part of a strategic plan to guide the French mutual group through to 2022 after its previous goals were met ahead of schedule. The bank’s listed arm aims for net income above €5bn and a target return on tangible equity (ROTE) above 11 per cent in 2022, it said in a statement on Thursday morning. Net income was €4.4bn in 2018. The bank, which has the largest retail customer base in Europe, is aiming to be the “number one in customer conquest” with a focus on payments and cash management, to increase revenue synergies by €1.3bn up to €10bn in 2022 while also pumping €15bn into IT over the next four years. It also wants to see its cost-to-income ratios across all business lines fall below 60 per cent in 2022, excluding the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund, the EU’s rescue kitty for failing lenders.  “The economic scenario is based on interest rates remaining low,” said Crédit Agricole in its statement. Crédit Agricole’s listed arm “had completed the majority of its 2019 business plan targets early, by the end of 2018. This stands in contrast to domestic peers which were forced at the same time to lower their 2020 ROTE targets and launch new restructuring plans to keep on track,” said analysts at Credit Suisse. “Crédit Agricole had already restructured its [corporate and investment banking] division several years earlier,” they added. The bank is thus less exposed to some of the more volatile markets that have hit its French rivals, Société Générale and BNP Paribas. The mutual aims for a core tier 1 equity ratio, a key measure of balance sheet strength, of 16 per cent for the group overall and 11 per cent for its listed arm by the end of 2022, taking “into account the much tougher regulatory requirements expected by this date”.  The plan “seeks to amplify and accelerate the Group’s growth in an uncertain environment, and in a context of growing societal expectations”, it said. In that vein, the group has also set out its raison d'être for the first time: “Working every day in the interest of our customers and society.” ","06.06.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Ferguson, Greggs, Hargreaves Lansdown, Wizz Air","Airlines have priced in a European recession that is unlikely to happen, says Merrill Lynch","Tuesday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Ferguson jumped after fourth-quarter results from the Americas-focused plumbing and heating supplier beat forecasts on cost savings and market share gains. Full-year trading profit was up 7.5 per cent at $1.6bn compared with a $1.57bn consensus.  On the possibility of switching its main market listing to New York and the planned demerger of its UK division, Ferguson said it would be “a number of months” before any decisions were made.  “While underlying growth in the key US market is expected to take a step down from recent years (as previously flagged), management remains confident of the ability to continue outperforming at the top line level, and they remain ready to continue adapting the cost base to protect profit. We expect limited forecast changes for now.”Jefferies ● Greggs led the FTSE 250 fallers after the bakery chain reported a moderation in sales growth and left full-year targets unchanged. Third-quarter total sales were up 12.4 per cent, or 7.4 per cent on a same-store basis, which compared with growth of 14.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent at the interim stage. Sellside stories ● Merrill Lynch started coverage of Wizz Air with a “buy” rating and added British Airways owner IAG to its “Europe 1” list of recommended stocks. Airlines “are priced for an outright euro area recession, which we think is unlikely”, it said.  Airlines’ relative performance is highly sensitive to euro area growth momentum, with the sector typically responding to purchasing managers’ index data as well as oil prices, said Merrill. But the sector’s 30 per cent underperformance versus the wider market since the start of the year “has been the sharpest and most prolonged underperformance over the past 15 years — and the most significant undershoot relative to the fair value implied by our analysis, based on the PMI and the oil price”, it said. The broker estimated that, at current levels, airlines are priced for the euro area composite PMI of 48.8 (a six-year low) to fall to 46 or for Brent crude to jump to $95 a barrel. “We think neither of these assumptions is likely to materialise.”  IAG has been held back by worries about Brexit and pilot strikes that have left the stock at a historic low, said Merrill, which set a 660p-a-share target price. The broker also put “buy” ratings on Air France-KLM and Ryanair, saying both airlines have robust balance sheets.  Merrill put a “neutral” rating on easyJet because of its reliance on the UK, which accounts for 44 per cent of group sales. Lufthansa and Norwegian Air were both rated “underperform”.  ● Credit Suisse started coverage of fund manager Hargreaves Lansdown with an “underperform” rating and £17.40 target price. “We find Hargreaves’ premium valuation difficult to support in the face of near-term revenue and earnings growth headwinds,” it said. Hargreaves’ higher-than-average pricing model and 65 per cent-plus operating profit margins may not be sustainable in the long term, it said. It noted that fund platform fees were under threat from new entrants, such as Fineco Bank and Vanguard, and that the gating in June of Woodford Equity Income may cause reputational damage. Entrants were also going after the 18 per cent of group revenue Hargreaves took from stockbroking services, while persistently low rates were a headwind for the 15 per cent of revenue that came from interest on client cash balances, it said. A valuation of 35 times current-year earnings therefore looked vulnerable compared with the sector average of 22.1 times, Credit Suisse said.  Separately, Panmure Gordon gave Hargreaves a “sell” rating as part of a sector initiation. “Globally the fund management industry is under revenue pressure from pricing and indexation. Costs are under pressure from regulation, product diversification and the internalisation of costs previously borne by clients. You could be forgiven for believing that there was no future. But the pressures are not new, nor necessarily accelerating.“The best defence is to provide fund investors with good risk-adjusted returns, and to do so over the long term. There is plenty of evidence that revenue margins can be robust if clients are happy. Longevity is the key to profitability, more so than a particular revenue margin. Costs must continue to come out, either a company’s own or someone else’s.”Panmure Hargreaves “has in our eyes confounded economic theory over the years by gaining market share despite never having a price-leading product”, said Panmure. While Hargreaves’ breadth and quality of service explains its historic outperformance the need to invest will crimp operational gearing going forward, said the broker, which set a price target of £16.96 per share.  Panmure’s sector review put “buy” ratings on Standard Life Aberdeen, Liontrust and Intermediate Capital.  Daily newsletter

"UBS plans negative interest rate for rich clients","Latest European bank to pass cost of central banks’ ‘lower for longer’ stance to depositors","UBS plans to levy a negative interest rate on wealthy clients who deposit more than SFr2m with its Swiss bank, as lenders hunker down for a period of ultra-loose monetary policy.  Several banks in Switzerland and the eurozone already pass on the cost of negative official rates to corporate depositors, although most large players have refrained from doing so with individual clients.  But with policymakers expected to adopt a “lower for longer” stance for the foreseeable future, UBS Switzerland will from November charge 0.75 per cent a year on individual cash balances above SFr2m, according to three people briefed on the plans.  The move underscores how banks in Europe and the US are scrambling to prepare for a protracted spell of lower rates that threatens their profitability, having previously wagered that central bankers would tighten monetary policy. Last month the Swiss National Bank said it would hold the negative rate it charges on commercial banks’ deposits at -0.75 per cent, while the European Central Bank deposit rate is -0.4 per cent. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later on Wednesday.  “A year ago everyone thought interest rates would go up. Now it doesn’t look like that,” said one senior wealth manager at UBS. In a note to clients last month, the lender forecast that the SNB would in September lower its rate on deposits to -1 per cent.  UBS relationship managers have started discussing the forthcoming charges with some wealthy clients and are preparing to issue a letter outlining the changes, the people added. Some of the bank’s smaller rivals, such as Julius Baer and Pictet, already charge some clients with large cash deposits.  “We assume that this period of low interest rates will last even longer and that banks will continue to have to pay negative interest rates on customer deposits at central banks,” UBS said. “Following similar moves by a number of other banks here in Switzerland, we confirm that we’ve decided to adjust cash deposit fees for Swiss francs held in Switzerland.” The move comes as Credit Suisse, UBS’s main rival, said on Wednesday it was also thinking about imposing a levy on some wealthy clients.  “In Switzerland, we are considering measures on deposits to mitigate pressure of negative interest rates,” Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse chief executive, told reporters during a discussion of the bank’s half-year results.  He said any levy would be “targeted on people . . . that measure their cash balances in millions”.  UBS clients who want to avoid the levy can move their balances into non-cash assets or into “fiduciary call deposits” that can be transferred back to the customer’s main account within 48 hours, two of the people said.  The FDCs are held in third-party banks or UBS entities based outside Switzerland, meaning the lender does not have to pay negative rates to the SNB, two of the people said. ","31.07.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Smiths, Aggreko, Learning Technologies, Pearson","B&Q owner Kingfisher is an unlikely break-up candidate, says Credit Suisse","Friday 11:00 GMT What’s happening ● Smiths slipped even after the engineering conglomerate delivered broadly in-line interim results, left full-year guidance unchanged and set a deadline to separately list its medical division in the UK by the first half of 2020.  Medical was the main negative in the report, said analysts, with margins weakening from 18.4 per cent last year to just 16.5 per cent. With the business having not grown organically in the last decade, “the focus will likely be on creating a more positive outlook ahead of the demerger supported by new product launches”, said RBC. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse downgraded Kingfisher to “neutral” from “outperform” with a 240p price target on the back of Thursday’s full-year results from the B&Q owner. It cited a lack of positive catalysts on the horizon, as well as macro risks in the UK and France. The departure of Kingfisher’s chief executive and its appointment of an interim chief finance officer mean the company has changed almost all its operating company bosses inside a year, which adds to risks around its restructuring plan, Credit Suisse said. The broker argued that improvements had been slow to come through and, while the current plan was entering its final year, restructuring for mature incumbent retailers was never complete.  Credit Suisse also argued that Kingfisher was an unlikely break-up candidate, given the increasing degree of integration between its retail businesses and its Screwfix trade counters. A move to a new common retail format and brand looked like a more realistic prospect, which would involve major changes to the store estate, it said.  ● Stifel upgraded Aggreko, the generator hire specialist, to “buy” from “hold” with an 880p target. “Our changed view is the building confidence that management’s actions and strategy to improve capital efficiency and address operational shortcomings is starting to deliver value to shareholders not yet captured by the share price. [Full-year 2018 results] showed positive signs of progress with 10 per cent underlying profit growth marking the first time in five years that profit growth has been achieved.”Stifel Stable bad debt provision, improving returns on capital employed and better utilisation “are all signs of a management team showing better control of its brief”, said Stifel. The broker also took a recent 2020 Tokyo Olympics award as suggesting momentum was recovering, which can “provide an enduring catalyst to the share price”.  ● Goldman Sachs started coverage of Learning Technologies
 with “buy” 113p as part of thematic research on how education services will develop over the next decade. It forecast global education spend to grow by 4.9 per cent per annum, reaching $18.9tn by 2030, and argued that companies specialising in career-long learning were the best placed to grow as there were weaker incumbents to displace.  Learning Technologies is “well positioned to benefit from structurally attractive growth in corporate learning, with scope for further bolt-on mergers and acquisitions given the fragmented nature of the market”, said Goldman. With automation requiring employees to obtain new skills, the next wave of growth will come from higher-value bespoke courses aided by more sophisticated human resources technology, Goldman concluded. “In our view, Learning Technologies’ business portfolio is well positioned to benefit from this inflection, given its bespoke content offering, which we see as a key differentiator versus larger peers.” ● In brief: Alstria Office upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Centamin rated new “hold” at Peel Hunt; Close Brothers raised to “hold” at Investec; EDP upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Intesa rated new “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Lagardère cut to equal- weight at Morgan Stanley; MTG cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Ophir Energy cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Panalpina cut to “underperform” at RBC; Pearson raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Saipem cut to “hold” at HSBC; Scandic rated new “sell” at Berenberg; TLG Immobilien upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; UniCredit rated new “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Vestas downgraded to “underweight” at JPMorgan.

"Tuna bond scandal may spell more trouble for Credit Suisse","Prosecutors could yet conclude that the bank put business interests before compliance","© Bloomberg When the US Department of Justice charged three former Credit Suisse bankers with fraud and overseas bribery, the allegations had a familiar ring. Prosecutors alleged last week that the trio had conspired with Mozambique’s former finance minister to borrow more than $2bn to fund a state fishing fleet and divert some of the proceeds into bribes and kickbacks. It is the second time since November 1 that senior employees of a big global bank have been indicted for allegedly helping to rip off a developing nation. Two former senior Goldman Sachs bankers have been charged with conspiring to siphon bond proceeds out of Malaysia’s 1MDB investment fund to enrich themselves and corrupt officials. (Tim Leissner has pleaded guilty; Roger Ng denies wrongdoing; lawyers for the three CS bankers declined to comment.)  Goldman itself has also been criminally charged by Malaysian prosecutors and it is still under US investigation. Legal analysts expect the Wall Street bank to face serious consequences. Not only is Malaysia seeking $7.5bn, but US prosecutors have used harsh words in court documents filed in the individual cases. They said the bank’s “business culture” was “highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritising this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions”. Goldman has said it is co-operating with the DoJ. Credit Suisse, which also says it is co-operating with authorities, so far looks to be in better shape. The UK has downgraded its investigation into the “tuna bond” scandal from criminal to regulatory, and last week’s US indictment emphasised the efforts the Credit Suisse defendants made to deceive the bank’s compliance department. Prosecutors cited the use of personal email addresses and referred to the employees as having “withheld” information. A former prosecutor told the Financial Times last week that the language of the indictment “adopts the bank’s narrative that these are rogues, they lied to us”. 
 One reason for the difference may be that Credit Suisse’s leadership has changed since the tuna bonds were marketed in 2013. Chief executive Tidjane Thiam joined the bank two years later and has restructured the way the bank handles deals with African countries. Goldman’s new chief executive David Solomon, by contrast, was among 30 senior executives who reviewed the 1MDB deals and has defended the bank’s culture against some criticisms.  Another difference is that the prosecutors probing Goldman have secured testimony from Mr Leissner, as part of his guilty plea, that misleading the compliance department was “very much in line” with Goldman’s culture. No named defendant in the Mozambique case has openly co-operated with prosecutors. But the Swiss bank may not be home free. Two former prosecutors told me that it is standard operating procedure for an indictment to emphasise concealment efforts because that supports allegations of intentional wrongdoing.   Two sections of the indictment in particular could spell trouble for Credit Suisse. One specifically says that the defendants were “acting within the scope of their employment . . . with the intent, at least in part to benefit” the bank. The other details the ways the defendants were allegedly able to ignore, lie to or circumvent the bank’s compliance department. Both could be a worry for Credit Suisse if prosecutors conclude that the bank had shoddy controls or put business interests ahead of compliance. The outcome of the case matters not just to Credit Suisse but also to Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries. It lost International Monetary Fund funding over the scandal and is struggling to pay back the debts it racked up with Credit Suisse’s help. Its citizens are hoping for a lifeline. “If Credit Suisse is found to have acted illegally . . . [it] should have to pay back the investors,” says Florival Mucave, a prominent local attorney. That only seems fair. brooke.masters@ft.com

"Stocks to watch: AstraZeneca, Unilever, Adecco, Nanogate, IMCD","Ocado will be no money-spinner for Marks and Spencer, says Goldman Sachs","Monday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● AstraZeneca hit a record high on two positive trial updates. The pharmaceuticals group said final-stage trials for its diabetes drug Farxiga was able to help patients with heart and cardiovascular problems, as well as giving more detail from a promising study of its Brilinta treatment when taken alongside aspirin. Kepler Cheuvreux called the Farxiga results “exceptional” and said consensus forecasts for drug sales of $2.5bn in 2024 now looked too pessimistic. However, the broker cautioned that upside was capped by Farxiga potentially losing key patent protection in 2025 and Eli Lilly announcing trial results of a competitor drug next year.  “The very consistent benefit — an impressive 26 per cent reduction in heart failure (HF) events or cardiovascular death — plus a clean safety profile, should mean at least $1bn upside to consensus Farxiga estimates, adding 2-3 per cent minimum to Astra’s valuation.”Kepler Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs reinstated “sell” advice on Marks and Spencer with a 170p target. Goldman had suspended coverage of M&S in February after the retailer revealed plans to form a UK joint venture with Ocado, to which the bank acts as joint house broker.  The Ocado venture has limited effect on M&S’s free cash flow, providing just £5.6m of associate income in the 2020 financial year, Goldman forecast. Based on the service delivering 11 per cent compound annual sales growth and improving the operating profit margin to 3.5 per cent, M&S would still only earn a modest £10.6m share of free cash flow by 2024 — equivalent to just 3 per cent of the group total, it forecast. Goldman also cited recent Kantar industry data as suggesting disappointing trading patterns for M&S. Fiscal first-quarter UK clothing and food sales were down 8 per cent and 1 per cent respectively with no improvement evident early in the second quarter, it said.  Signs of weak trading led Goldman to cut its 2020 earnings forecast by 5.7 per cent to 18.9p per share, which would be down 22.5 per cent year on year. It valued M&S at 9 times earnings, in the middle of a UK peer group trading between 8 and 13 times.  ● Goldman Sachs upgraded Unilever from “neutral” to “buy”, with target prices of £57 and €62. A lack of sales growth relative to peers has meant Unilever’s Dutch and UK shares rose 17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively in the year to date, underperforming the European staples sector’s 32 per cent advance, said Goldman. But growth should improve in 2020 on improved trends in three of Unilever’s four emerging markets growth engines accounting for close to a fifth of group sales, it said. “We expect rural demand to pick up in India, market share losses to reverse in Brazil as the economy drags itself out of recession, and an improvement in Indonesia from new product launches and stability in advertising and promotion spend (following share loss over a number of years). Favourable monetary and fiscal policies in each of the regions is also likely to support consumer spending in the context of an uncertain global trade backdrop.” India, Brazil and Indonesia can move Unilever’s sales growth back towards the circa 4 per cent level in 2020, helping close the share’s current 6 per cent discount to the sector, Goldman said. “We believe that an improvement in sales growth will alleviate investor concerns around the potential for a marketing-led margin reset, underpinning the ability for [earnings] margins to reach 20 per cent by the end of 2020.” The broker forecast Unilever to deliver 7 per cent annual EPS growth through to 2021, “which we view as attractive given the stock’s defensive characteristics, along with the most attractive dividend yield of the European bellwethers”. ● In brief: Adecco raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Alstria Office raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Foresight Solar cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; IMCD raised to “buy” at HSBC; LondonMetric cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Nanogate cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Naturgy raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Randstad raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; SFC Energy rated new “buy” at Commerzbank; Smart Metering Systems raised to “overweight” at Barclays.

"Stocks to watch: Saga, Direct Line, Fevertree, JD Sports, Puma","Marks and Spencer still needs to fix the basics, says HSBC","Friday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Saga led the insurers lower in reaction to a proposal from the Financial Conduct Authority to ban loyalty penalties. The watchdog said the market for the pricing of home and motor insurance products was “not working well for all consumers”, particularly those who did not shop around for renewal quotes “It is now clear that the FCA is looking to intervene in some form, and therefore the structure of the industry is likely to change. We believe home insurance sees the greatest cross subsidy between new and existing customers, but motor may also be affected. Given that the FCA is highlighting that customers may be collectively overpaying by £1.2bn, it is likely . . . it will aim to reduce this, suggesting a smaller industry profit pool.”JPMorgan Cazenove Direct Line and Saga were vulnerable because of their relatively high home-insurance exposure, said analysts. For auto insurers such as Hastings and Admiral the main risk was that regulatory action would nip in the bud any pricing recovery.  “We think recent signs of the cycle improving are now likely to be revered as insurers cut prices on their renewal book. Remember renewal policies count for around 70 per cent of business and so is the dominant factor in determining average premium inflation,” said Credit Suisse. ● Fevertree Drinks was under pressure after industry data suggested tough recent trading for the tonic water maker, in spite of the warm August bank holiday. Company UK sales were up 0.1 per cent year on year in the four weeks to September 8, compared with 5.5 per cent growth for the overall soft drinks category, according to Nielsen data. The “flattish performance” meant Fevertree’s UK sales were down 6 per cent in the second half to date, compared with a consensus forecast of around 20 per cent growth, said Jefferies. “Newsflow is starting to inflect, but some risk the downgrade cycle is not fully complete, which keeps us on the sidelines with Fevertree a growth stock,” the broker said. Sellside stories ● HSBC downgraded Marks and Spencer from “hold” to “reduce” with a 150p-a-share target price. A capital markets day this week “illustrated how much work there is left to do” at M&S’s clothing and homewares (C&H) division, it said. “M&S remains firmly in the ‘restoring the basics’ phase of its five-year transformation. While green shorts of strategic progress in food and group cost savings are starting to show through, the admission that C&H is now circa 18 months behind plan will drag on the M&S transformation. This also reflects the uphill struggle that M&S has already faced in redefining its C&H proposition in what remains a highly competitive UK apparel market.”HSBC Tougher UK market conditions are likely to weigh on M&S’s first-half results due in November, the broker said. It also argued that the retailer had failed to develop a point of difference capable of drawing in the mainstream customers it aims to attract. And with spend shifting online, M&S was “pitched against a spectrum of larger, more relevant, and better invested fast-fashion peers”, HSBC argued. Its price target was equivalent to 8.3 times M&S’s 2020 earnings, a 29 per cent discount to the wider retail sector.  ● Exane BNP Paribas started coverage of JD Sports and Puma with “outperform” ratings in a review of global sporting goods companies. Nike and Adidas were rated “underperform” and “neutral” respectively.  In contrast to the general retailers, structural trends for sportswear were “unambiguously positive” with demand growth outstripping GDP, said Exane. It argued that the companies were benefiting from emerging markets expansion, growth in womenswear and athleisure, market share concentration and a shift towards online sales. Exane saw all the sportswear groups offering high sales growth, low volatility, high quality and strong price momentum. But if investors switched to favouring low profitability but high free cash flow yields, the entire sector would derate, it cautioned. “We have therefore rated the sporting goods brands relative to one another, rather than making the easy call to own sporting goods over general retail.” JD “is the only FTSE 100 retailer in the UK, aside from Ocado, with material growth prospects”, Exane said. “Our analysis suggests potential to triple international locations with the eponymous chain. The group also has margin upside potential. Profitable European and Asian operations should see favourable scale effects. But the biggest opportunity to lift group profitability comes in the USA.” Puma was “the most fashion-forward of the brands” and took the biggest proportion of sales from womenswear, Exane said. “Gaining credibility in US basketball not only helps unlock this opportunity in the US but also guards against lacking credibility which was the brand’s Achilles heel at the start of the decade. We expect Puma to continue to deliver constant currency sales growth that is faster than at both Adidas and Nike.” Adidas has lagged behind Nike and Puma and, while sales growth should improve next year thanks in part to a repair of supply chain issues, its “brand heat appears stable at best”, said Exane. The stock has gained 47 per cent in the year to date yet catalysts were few for the coming year, because management was not expected to deliver a new long-term plan until November 2020, said the broker.  On Nike, Exane saw the company’s record of forecast-beating quarterly earnings as a false comfort, as estimates tend to fall between quarters. “Our analysis suggests Nike has the greatest currency headwind of our sporting goods coverage and, in the past, this has led to gross margin declines. Hence, whilst recent performance and guidance is reassuring, we see more limited opportunity for margin expansion than at rivals.” ● In brief: Boku rated new “buy” at Stifel; Brickability rated new “buy” at Cenkos Securities; H&M raised to “buy” at HSBC; Hexagon cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Huhtamaki rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Recordati cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse.

"Citi plans to take full ownership of Chinese securities business","US bank seeks to take advantage of new rules in China to expand its business there","Citigroup is pushing to be the first foreign bank to take full ownership of its securities business in China, as the US lender tries to leapfrog rivals and take advantage of an easing of rules from Beijing. As part of its plan, Citi is unwinding its current joint venture with Orient Securities, a local company in which it had a 33 per cent stake, and will next year submit an application for a fully owned business, according to people familiar with the matter.  Despite the trade war with the US, Beijing has continued to open up its capital markets to foreign investors and loosen regulations on how western financial institutions can operate in the world’s second-biggest economy. In July, the People’s Bank of China announced that limits on foreign ownership of securities business and fund management companies would be abolished from next year. If Citi is successful in its application, it would allow the bank to push further into a market that generated more than $1bn of the $15.4bn of Asian revenues it had last year, the people said. The bank reckons that full ownership would give it an advantage over foreign banks that simply have majority control of joint ventures.  Citi is likely to focus its initial efforts on expanding its brokerage and futures trading, the people say. However, the wholly owned business is unlikely to immediately offer investment banking services on the mainland as the costs of doing so, including having a minimum of 35 local employees, are high. China is one of the US bank’s top three Asian markets for its investment banking business. Citi has been an underwriter on a number of large, China-focused deals, including last month’s initial public offering in Hong Kong of the Asian business of Anheuser-Busch, the world’s biggest brewer.  Foreign banks have been allowed to enter joint ventures in China as minority partners since 2004. That was eased in 2017, when foreign institutions were allowed to take controlling stakes of up to 51 per cent in the ventures. In August, Goldman Sachs applied to take majority control of a securities joint venture in which it already holds 33 per cent. Swiss bank UBS was the first to receive approval for majority ownership, receiving the green light in December to raise its stake in Beijing-based UBS Securities from almost 25 per cent to 51 per cent. Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Nomura are also all seeking majority stakes in their joint ventures. “Citi continues to evaluate opportunities to further support its clients in China,” the bank said in an emailed statement. Citi’s plans were first reported by Bloomberg. Citi plans to have sold its entire stake in the Orient joint venture by the end of 2019, according to the people.","15.10.2019"
"China co-working company Ucommune seeks IPO in US","Beijing group aims to go public despite implosion of planned listing by rival WeWork","Ucommune, China’s largest co-working company, is pushing ahead with an initial public offering in the US this year, despite the implosion of plans to list by rival WeWork.  The Beijing-based company, valued at about $3bn in a $200m fundraising round a year ago, has filed a confidential prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is seeking a US listing before the end of the year, according to people familiar with the matter.  While the timing of the filing was surprising given WeWork’s struggles to fill its offices in China, Ucommune had “monetised the business better than WeWork,” said one person with knowledge of the deal.  WeWork formally withdrew its plan for an IPO last month after a listing process that started with hopes of topping a $47bn valuation and ended with the departure of its chief executive Adam Neumann. Ucommune has appointed Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Bank of America to work on the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. All three banks declined to comment. Ucommune declined to comment.  Chinese companies listing in the US face increased scrutiny as relations between the two countries have soured. In June, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill targeting China, which would delist companies that do not open their books to US regulators. The bill also requires the disclosure of any Chinese Communist party officials on the board, which for many businesses in China is a must for political expediency. Ucommune has been expanding rapidly, and was reported to be eyeing a $200m US IPO next year. The company is backed by Chinese conglomerate Beijing Xingpai Group, and has partnered with developer RK Properties.  The Chinese market has not been a happy hunting ground for office landlords in the past year, with vacancy rates at levels not seen since the financial crisis. Across 17 major cities vacancy rates stood at 21.5 per cent, according to data from commercial property group CBRE. “China’s co-working space has seen a great expansion over the last three to five years, but the barriers to entry are low and it’s a hard space to be in,” said James MacDonald, director of China Research at Savills Property Services.  The aggressive expansion of rival co-working operator WeWork has fanned oversupply in the market, while an economic slowdown and the trade-war have suppressed demand.  The Financial Times revealed on Friday that WeWork had a vacancy rate of 35.7 per cent in their Shanghai offices this month, while in Shenzhen, where the company has 8,000 desks, 65.3 per cent were vacant. Despite the oversupply, “we still have a bullish view on the flexible workspace sector as a whole. [There are] quite a lot of opportunities for operators, both established Chinese operators and international players,” said Jonathan Wright, head of flexible workspace services in Asia for Colliers, the real estate company.  Originally called UrWork, Ucommune became China’s first co-working unicorn in 2017 and has extended its footprint to Los Angeles, New York and Singapore.

"US companies take foot off stock buybacks pedal","The sharp growth in share repurchases after last year’s corporate tax cut has slowed in 2019","The breakneck growth in corporate share buybacks that has helped propel the stock market to record highs is starting to cool at a pivotal time for US stocks, as concerns around a slowing global economy, trade tensions and a dovish central bank weigh heavily.  Buybacks are set to hit a total of $940bn this year, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, up 13 per cent on last year’s total, but a sharp deceleration from the 54 per cent growth seen in 2017-18. Last year’s spurt was driven by a cut to the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, which prompted US companies to spend $833bn on their own stock. Bank of America analysts have also noted a slowdown. Based on an analysis of its own corporate clients’ buying trends, the bank said these companies are spending 12 per cent more on buybacks this year, a fraction of last year’s growth.
 “Heading into the peak of earnings season, corporate buybacks picked up slightly last week,” Jill Hall, equity and quant strategist for Bank of America, said in a research note. “But the growth rate for cumulative buybacks year to date continued to slow to 12 per cent year-over-year. We have expected the pace of buybacks to slow as we move into 2020.” The slowdown in buyback growth sounds a cautious note for equity investors in the midst of second-quarter earnings. Stock repurchases reduce the amount of shares that trade on the stock exchange, improving key metrics like earnings per share, which typically boosts a company’s share price. For the past decade, buybacks have outranked dividends as the favoured mechanism for returning cash to shareholders. The deceleration adds another layer of uncertainty for equity investors alongside the spectre of slowing economic growth, trade tensions and the US Federal Reserve’s ambiguous stance on interest rates. On Wednesday the Fed cut the rate by 0.25 percentage points — its first reduction since the financial crisis of 2008 — sending the S&P 500 1.1 per cent lower by the end of the trading day. 
  Apple, the biggest buyer of its own stock, highlighted again this week the benefits of buybacks: its quarterly results showed a near 13 per cent year-on-year slide in net income, but thanks to the reduction in its share count its earnings per share were down just 7 per cent. The iPhone maker purchased $17bn 

of its own stock in the second quarter down from $23bn in the first three months of the year. “The trend we’re seeing today is nowhere near as strong as 2018 but companies are still growing earnings and they are still going to give that money to shareholders through buybacks and dividends,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist for Credit Suisse. 
 Second-quarter earnings per share for US stocks are set to grow up to 3.3 per cent, according to Credit Suisse predictions, a bump that would sidestep the prospect of an “earnings recession” — whereby earnings contract for two consecutive quarters — that analysts had feared after negative growth in the first quarter.  US stocks are on track for the best year in decades, gaining 20 per cent so far this year. Last week the S&P 500 set a new record, driven in part by a blistering 10 per cent surge for Alphabet, Google’s parent company, after positive earnings results.","02.08.2019"
"China’s biggest sportswear retailer jumps in Hong Kong debut ","Shares in Topsports rise 10% on first day of trading despite city’s unrest","Shares in Topsports International, China’s biggest sportswear group, sprinted higher in their trading debut in Hong Kong the week after the company raised more than $1bn in an initial public offering. The group’s stock climbed as much as 11.8 per cent to HK$9.50 (US$1.21) on a day when the benchmark Hang Seng index was little changed amid a flurry of conflicting US-China trade war headlines. The shares were later trading up 9.4 per cent. Topsports — backed by Chinese private equity giants CDH Investments and Hillhouse — manufactures and distributes sports apparel for global brands including Adidas and Nike via its network of more than 8,000 outlets across China.  The company was carved out of Chinese footwear retailer Belle International, which was taken private by CDH and Hillhouse in a $6.8bn deal in 2017. The shares priced at HK$8.50, or near the bottom of an indicated range, when sold to investors earlier in October ahead of the listing.  The lone analyst that covers the stock, Macquarie’s Terence Chang, has a target price of HK$11.20 on the shares, or about 20 per cent higher than the trading price in Hong Kong on Thursday.  The company has been pitched to investors as a play on the increasing aspirations and wealth of China’s middle class, a group that Credit Suisse estimates to number 400m people. It has been a lean year for new listings on the Hong Kong bourse. In 2019 so far, the value of new listings that have priced in the city is down by about 40 per cent compared with the same period last year. Earlier this week, the operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange dropped an audacious $37bn bid to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group that was viewed by analysts as an attempt to pivot its long-term strategy away from China. How sneaker fans are cashing in on the $2bn resale market for limited edition trainers But a clutch of deals in Hong Kong has been resurrected in recent weeks after initially being cancelled amid the toxic political unrest that has plagued the city for the past four months and a weak sentiment towards the local market, which turned in the worst performance among developed markets in the third quarter. The Asia-Pacific unit of Anheuser-Busch, the world’s biggest brewer, raised $5.75bn in September after initially shelving its attempted IPO in Hong Kong in July. Since listing in the city on September 29, the shares have risen by about 18 per cent. Warburg Pincus-backed ESR Cayman, a logistics and warehouse operator in Asia, is also looking to come back to the market with the intention of raising more than $1bn, according to bankers.

"UBS plots revamp of investment bank after performance falters","Hundreds of jobs could be on the block especially in the higher ranks at Swiss lender","UBS is preparing an overhaul of its investment bank as the Swiss lender seeks to galvanise earnings and cut costs after a drop off in performance over the past few quarters. As part of the revamp, due to be announced at a townhall on Thursday, executives are discussing hundreds of job cuts at the investment bank, especially within the higher ranks, as duplicate roles are cut after sweeping divisional mergers, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank’s main equities division will be combined with its smaller foreign exchange, rates and credit trading (FRC) operations to create a single securities and trading unit, said three people with knowledge of the changes. Jason Barron, head of equities, will run the unit alongside George Athanasopoulos, head of FRC. On the advisory side of the business, Ros Stephenson and Javier Oficialdegui will be named global co-heads of investment banking, overseeing the bank’s M&A and capital markets activities around the world, they said. The division will be rebranded from corporate client solutions (CCS) and will introduce a global rather than regional structure as in the past. Additionally, all debt and equity capital markets functions will be combined into one global unit for the first time and led by Brendan Connolly, formerly the head of leveraged debt capital markets. Along with much of the industry, UBS’s investment bank has gone through a rough patch of late amid geopolitical tensions, low client activity levels and regulatory changes. These challenges have been exacerbated by the loss of high-profile dealmaker Andrea Orcel, who ran the unit between 2012 until his departure last September to become CEO of Santander, a move which eventually fell through. The investment bank made a surprise $47m loss in the fourth quarter of last year followed by two quarters of sharp declines in year-on-year profits. While better than many rivals, especially on the advisory side, it still prompted questions from investors and analysts about whether the bank had the right strategy. UBS’s stock has fallen 32 per cent in the past 12 months. Mr Orcel’s successors, M&A banker Piero Novelli and trader Rob Karofsky, now almost a year into their roles, hope the changes will simplify the bank’s structure and drive earnings, particularly on the trading side, the people said. Chief executive Sergio Ermotti’s overhaul of the investment bank closely follows changes made at UBS’s primary wealth management division, which last week recruited former Credit Suisse executive Iqbal Khan to address concerns about succession planning and lacklustre performance.  Mr Khan will take over from Martin Blessing on October 1 as co-head of wealth management alongside Tom Naratil. Mr Blessing is leaving UBS.","04.09.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Vodafone, Kering, easyJet, Sage, Unibail, Capco","Berkeley’s near-50% margins on London flats suggest an earnings beat, says Jefferies","Friday 15:00 BST What’s happening ● Vodafone led the FTSE 100 gainers after setting out plans to spin off its towers division to help reduce debt, an idea management had rejected less than a year ago. It targeted legal separation to create Europe’s largest towers portfolio by May 2020 with monetisation options including a float, the disposal of a minority stake or a carve-up on a country-by-country level. Peer valuations suggested an enterprise value on Vodafone’s towers unit of between €10bn and €20bn. The move “could unlock significant value and see the shares re-rate as much as 50-60 per cent”, said JPMorgan Cazenove. “In a blue sky scenario it is conceivable that Vodafone’s rump equity value could close to double.” ● Kering 

slumped after second-quarter results showed its key brand Gucci was losing momentum faster than expected.  Gucci, which accounts for about four-fifths of Kering’s group profit, delivered 12.7 per cent like-for-like growth in the quarter rather than the 15 per cent the consensus expected. The US was the big problem for Gucci with sales down 2 per cent, which management blamed on tough macro conditions, though slowing demand from European and Chinese nationals suggested broader issues. At a group level Kering’s update was in line with expectations. “We believe it is too early to say if Italian baroque is going out of favour (ie. is the fashion cycle turning against Gucci) or if Gucci’s more pronounced than expected slowdown in the second quarter could be a function of Gucci prioritising margin expansion over top line growth/desirability in the past few quarters — something which could be addressed (though at a cost).”Morgan Stanley Sellside stories ● Jefferies upgraded Berkeley, the London-focused housebuilder, to “buy” from “hold” with a £43.91 target price. A site-by-site analysis of Berkley’s development pipeline suggests gross margins could exceed forecasts and management’s 2021 guidance may be too low by 24 per cent, said Jefferies. A high proportion of Berkeley’s earnings over the next four years will come from sites acquired or given planning permission before 2016, after which build costs such as the community infrastructure levy cranked higher, the broker said. Comparing likely selling prices against an average construction cost of about £500 per sq ft, Jefferies estimated that Berkeley was earning a 40.6 per cent gross margin at its White City development near Shepherd’s Bush and a 47.2 per cent gross margin at South Quay Plaza on the Isle of Dogs. “Assuming a relatively unchanged proportion of affordable and outside London product, this suggests that our [profit] forecasts are up to 30 per cent short,” it said. ● Stifel upgraded Capital & Counties to “buy” from “hold” with a 265p target price. Its call came after Capco said on Thursday it would proceed with a break-up and split its Covent Garden property portfolio from the stalled Earl's Court development in west London. “Until now, the shares have been hindered by concerns over the value of the Earl's Court land, but we think the creation of two separate businesses, which will leave shareholders with the ability to determine their own weightings in each portfolio, will unlock significant shareholder value. In our view, the period before demerger presents an early opportunity to gain exposure to the two London estates at a low entry price.”Stifel Capco has been trading at a “huge” discount to a 315p end-June net asset value, Stifel said. Putting the Covent Garden estate at a 20 per cent discount to book value, in line with closest peer Shaftesbury, would imply that the Earl's Court assets are worth zero, it estimated. “No value is being ascribed to Earl's Court on constant asset valuations, despite the entity having £100m of net cash and covering the largest redevelopment site in London.”  London land values have been volatile but Earl's Court was written down from £45m per acre at its peak to £23.5m per acre, said Stifel. At current levels the private residential property is being priced at £1,500 per sq ft, “which we consider fair for this well-connected area of West London”, it said. The broker put Covent Garden and Earl's Court at discounts of 15 per cent and 25 per cent to book value to arrive at its 265p valuation.  ● In brief: ASR Nederland rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Aegon rated new “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Ageas rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Albioma cut to “hold” at HSBC; Bilia raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; easyJet cut to “sell” at Société Générale; Howden Joinery raised to “hold” at Stifel; Klépierre cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; MTU Aero cut to “sell” at Société Générale; NN rated new “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Roche raised to “buy” at UBS; Sage cut to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse; Stabilus rated new “neutral” at UBS; Tarkett cut to “hold” at HSBC; Unibail cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Worldline cut to “reduce” at HSBC.

"Thiam pulled Credit Suisse from Covéa deal, Scor chief says","Denis Kessler says chief of Swiss bank intervened to stop advising rival on bid","Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam intervened personally to stop the bank advising French insurance group Covéa on a contentious move to buy rival Scor, according to the head of the takeover target.  The Swiss bank was working with mutual insurer Covéa on a possible bid for Paris-based reinsurer Scor, but pulled out in the autumn.  In an interview with French business newspaper Les Echos, Scor chief executive Denis Kessler said the decision was down to Mr Thiam himself. “I salute the exemplary behaviour of Tidjane Thiam who decided, after an internal inquiry, to pull his support from Covéa in the month of November 2018,” he said.  It is unusual for a the group chief executive of a bank to make such a direct intervention in the day-to-day operations of one of its business units. Credit Suisse declined to comment.  Scor pushed back strongly against the bid, and Covéa said last month that it was no longer interested in buying the company. But the saga is not at an end. Mr Kessler has launched legal action against Covéa, its chief executive Thierry Derez and its other advisers, Barclays and Rothschild.  Covéa owns an 8 per cent stake in Scor, and Mr Derez was on the Scor board of directors until last November. The reinsurer alleges that Mr Derez distributed confidential information he had learnt as a Scor director to Covéa and its bankers, to further the mutual’s chances of a successful deal.  Scor won a case in London’s High Court in December to force Credit Suisse to hand over documents relating to the deal. Mr Kessler told Les Echos: “Credit Suisse sent us more than 395 mails and 3,000 pages, which contained information and documents from Scor that should never have been sent to third parties.” He added that Mr Derez had “violated obligations of loyalty and confidentiality which constrained him and committed an abuse of trust”. Covéa has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement last month, the company said: “Covéa’s board of directors firmly rejects all the groundless accusations made by Scor and reaffirms its unanimous support to Thierry Derez and his action. Covéa will take all action in order to defend its interests in view of the serious reputational harm resulting from Scor’s unacceptable accusations.”  Mr Derez was not immediately available for comment. He dismissed Scor’s claims as “contrived” in an interview with Le Monde earlier this month. Covéa’s other advisers, Barclays and Rothschild, continued to work for the insurer after Credit Suisse pulled out. They are now facing legal action from Scor in the UK High Court and have declined to comment on the case. ","11.02.2019"
"SoftBank-backed start-up Fair to cut 40% of its staff","Several co-founders and CFO among those to lose jobs at car subscription company","Fair, the car subscription start-up that partners with Uber and is backed by SoftBank, is cutting hundreds of jobs as it struggles to find a profitable path forward. The Santa Monica-based company, whose operations launched just 26 months ago, allows customers to lease used vehicles via an app for an all-inclusive monthly price including insurance and repair. Fair has so far raised around half a billion dollars in equity and more than $1.5bn in debt, helping it become a leader in the budding market for car subscriptions. But it has struggled with the economics of a business that has required it to spend vast sums purchasing a fleet of around 50,000 vehicles. The cuts come just as SoftBank’s once-prized asset WeWork plans to reduce 30 per cent of its own workforce amid a frenzied $9.5bn rescue plan. WeWork’s woes have forced SoftBank to address profitability issues across its investment portfolio, which in turn compelled Fair to come up with an aggressive plan centred on sustainable profits, according to people familiar with the matter. Founder and chief executive Scott Painter informed his staff of the cuts, which account for 40 per cent of the company’s workforce and will take place with immediate effect, in a memo on Thursday. “I’ve decided to focus the company’s resources on strengthening Fair’s core technology and reducing costs associated with the capital-intensive supply side of our business,” the memo said. “Going forward, Fair will be a smaller team, focused on doing fewer things well.” The cuts include several co-founders and reach into the C-suite, with chief financial officer Tyler Painter — the chief executive’s brother — being let go, signalling that the cost-cutting plan will include a new business strategy. Kirk Shryoc, a structured finance expert, will be the new CFO. Mr Painter, the chief executive, told the Financial Times that Fair will still “deliver growth and expansion”, but it is shifting gears from “hypergrowth” to something more manageable. “Things like this are never fun but I would much rather be announcing that we are getting the religion now — that we need to be really focused on creating long-term value — than telling you that there’s a bad outcome.” Long-term, he wants Fair to be a public company. “What steps we take now will pay off in big ways later,” he said. Just a few weeks ago Fair was adding hundreds of cars to its portfolio each day and expanding to one new US city per month. In September it purchased rival Canvas from Ford for an undisclosed sum and then raised $500m of debt from Mizuho Bank and SoftBank, whose Vision Fund also led its $385m Series B funding round last December. The debt funding was meant to “unlock new levels of growth” by expanding a fleet of cars that would be available to Uber drivers. Fair has partnered with Uber since early 2018, when it acquired the ride-hailing giant’s fledgling leasing business. Fair has also raised debt from Ally Financial, Silicon Valley Bank, and it has debt facilities from Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. Its $50m Series A funding round in March 2018 was led by Next47, the venture arm of German conglomerate Siemens.

"Stocks to watch: Premier Oil, JD Sports, Revolution, Paddy Power","Maxed-out credit accounts pose a risk for Next, says Credit Suisse","Monday 13:30 GMT What’s happening ● Premier Oil led the FTSE 250 fallers after confirming it may bid for UK North Sea fields put up for sale by Chevron. The Sunday Times 
reported that Premier was considering a rights issue or share placement to help fund a possible £1.5bn purchase from Chevron, should it win an auction for the assets. The paper named private equity-backed Chrysaor, Delek and Ineos as rival bidders. “Increasing Premier’s focus on the UK makes sense from the perspective of accelerating the use of its $4.1bn in UK tax losses. The sale of non-UK assets may be part of a plan to fund North Sea acquisitions, but we think time constraints mean it is unlikely to be part of the initial funding solution for the Chevron package”Barclays ● JD Sports

The operator said weaker like-for-like sales over October and November meant fiscal second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be £12m rather than the £16m investors expected. Peel Hunt cut its 2019 year-end profit estimate for Revolution in half to £4.1m and only forecast a modest improvement for 2020. Downgrading to “hold” from “add”, it said: “The prospect of corporate activity remains a possibility, but stabilising trading and executing on new initiatives must be the sole focus of management.” Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse downgraded Next to “underperform” from “neutral”, with a £48 target.  “While the fourth quarter demonstrated how well managed Next is and the surprising resilience of the brand, we see no end to the gradual margin attrition, and it is likely to accelerate in future years as foreign exchange [benefit] turns negative, which will eventually impact cash generation”Credit Suisse Next brand sales in the UK have been in decline for three years and could worsen as the closure of peers affects high street footfall, resulting in accelerated margin pressure, Credit Suisse said. The broker also argued that Next’s finance business looked “maxed out” as the credit book has grown 80 per cent in five years, in spite of a declining number of credit account holders.  A valuation of 11 times forward earnings matches peers, leaving little upside given concerns over UK consumption, it said. Credit Suisse saw more value “in categories and stocks with structural growth” such as in online, discount and sporting goods. ● Barclays downgraded Paddy Power to “equal-weight” from “overweight” as part of a gambling sector review.  Regulatory pressure in the UK is expected to slow earnings growth and further damp sentiment, with second-quarter results “likely to be very poor” for the bookie due to the introduction of a £2 stake cap on fixed-odds betting terminals, said Barclays. US investment costs will drag on bookmakers’ margins while advertising bans threaten to lower revenue growth and, in a momentum-driven sector, these short-term issues point to further share price volatility, the broker argued. Over the longer term, Barclays saw encouraging signs that the industry was taking self-regulation seriously and argued that investors would eventually benefit from globalisation, consolidation and a structural shift towards online betting. It repeated “overweight” ratings on GVC and William Hill but downgraded Paddy Power on valuation grounds.  ● In brief: 3i Infrastructure cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Beiersdorf downgraded to “sell” at UBS; Brooks Macdonald upgraded to “buy” at Shore Capital; Burberry raised to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Countryside Properties cut to “underweight” at JPMorgan; DoBank upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Engie raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Heineken cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; HSBC cut to “sell” at Deutsche Bank; JTC rated “buy” at Citigroup; Legrand downgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Sanne rated “neutral” at Citigroup; Schneider downgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"Global dealmaking grinds to slowest pace in two years","Fears of economic slowdown sap corporate confidence as M&A activity falls 11%","Global dealmaking has eased to the slowest pace in more than two years, as fears of an economic slowdown sap corporate confidence and a $200bn tobacco industry merger was abandoned due to shareholder criticism.  Total mergers and acquisitions activity has fallen 11 per cent so far this year to $2.8tn, with roughly $740bn of deals clinched in the third quarter, according to new figures from data provider Refinitiv.  Those sums have been supported by a wave of mega-transactions greater than $10bn in size, which have helped offset a broad decline in dealmaking among smaller companies as well as a slight drop-off in private equity buyouts. The three months to the end of September proved to be the quietest quarter for announced takeovers since the middle of 2017, even as investment bankers in the US tried to tee up a mega-deal between tobacco groups Altria and Philip Morris International.  But that deal, like several before it, faced a critical reaction from shareholders — with the stocks of both companies declining after the two made public their talks — and ultimately collapsed last week. “Today’s M&A market is driven by companies looking to become stronger to withstand periods of uncertainty,” said Chris Ventresca, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan Chase. “There is increased worry that the status quo business plan may not be sufficient to withstand a harsh downturn or prolonged period of uncertainty.”  European dealmaking was down 32 per cent to $556bn compared to the same period a year ago, the slowest since 2017 as uncertainty surrounding Britain’s exit from the European Union weighed on activity. Activity in Asia was also off sharply, hit by a steep decline in Chinese acquisitions, which fell to a 12-year low.  The drop off in Europe came even as investors have cheered a $27bn bid by the London Stock Exchange Group to purchase Refinitiv. The fate of that transaction will become more clear within the next two weeks as Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing faces a deadline to make firm bid in its efforts to purchase the LSE Group and scupper the Refinitiv deal. The third quarter saw a dearth of activity among the types of transactions that are critical for Wall Street’s profitability engine. The number of deals agreed this year worth less than $5bn have fallen 11 per cent, including a 24 per cent decline in transactions valued between $1bn and $5bn.  “M&A markets thrive when CEOs and directors have confidence in the future, and it’s hard to have confidence in the future when the world around you is in turmoil both economically and politically,” said Scott Barshay, a partner at law firm Paul Weiss.  “So a lot of companies are in wait-and-see mode on strategic transactions until they have a better idea on how some of these geopolitical and economic uncertainties will play out,” he added.  Dealmakers admitted that M&A was entering into the final innings of what has been one of the strongest and longest deal cycles in history. But several said that there was still considerable room for expansion given low interest rates and the easy availability of cash on the market to finance transactions.  Without singling out any company, James Woolery, veteran dealmaker and head of M&A corporate at law firm King & Spalding, added that he expected many large groups would spin off units or sell assets in a bid to rationalise their portfolios.  This has been true so far this year for companies such as Pfizer, the US pharma giant that spun off its Upjohn unit and combined it with generics drugmaker Mylan to create an off-patent group with an enterprise valuation of about $50bn, as well as brewer AB InBev, which agreed to sell its Australian operations to Japan’s Asahi for about $11.3bn. Pressure remains on corporate boards to spin-off slower growth units, with campaigns from activists like Elliott Management and Third Point contributing to M&A activity. Elliott, which is one of the most active hedge fund investors, has urged telecom and media group AT&T to sell a number of assets, including DirecTV and HBO. Daniel Loeb of Third Point has directed his efforts at Sony, pushing for the company to spin-off its “crown jewel” image sensor business. Robin Rankin, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse, said: “It’s fairly tough to announce deals as well as closing them once they are agreed but there are encouraging signs that things are going to get better.” She added: “If the economy continues to grow, even at a slow pace, M&A activity should improve. What we are experiencing now is just short term challenges in part due to uncertainty, and disconnect between buyers and sellers.”  The drop in M&A activity is reverberating across Wall Street, which has become dependent on the very largest transactions. Those assignments can be incredibly lucrative, as evidenced by the $123m JPMorgan Chase stands to earn for its role in Botox-maker Allergan’s planned $63bn sale to US pharmaceutical group AbbVie.   But failure — such as missing out on a big deal or working on one that collapses — can weigh heavily on an M&A department’s earnings. Overall, fees generated from advising on takeovers are down 11 per cent this year to $20.3bn, a five-year low.  Data from Refinitiv shows M&A fees earned by Morgan Stanley, Citi, Credit Suisse and UBS are all down at least 20 per cent so far this year. The majority of fees are paid out when a deal is completed. The bright spot for many banks has been the surge of debt issuance by their corporate clients, who have sought to take advantage of the dramatic drop in interest rates. Bond underwriting fees have climbed 12 per cent this year to $25bn, the highest level since Refinitiv began collecting the data in 2000. And despite a number of high profile initial public offerings this year, the number of new flotations has dropped significantly, pushing fees from equity issuance down 16 per cent. Analysts are expecting a mixed picture when banks begin reporting third-quarter earnings on October 15. Morgan Stanley has warned that the business of listing new companies is “clearly much slower” than a year ago, Citigroup has said it will have lower investment banking fees, while JPMorgan Chase said its investment fees for the third quarter would be “about flat” versus a year earlier.

"Opening Quote: Accounting watchdog launches probe into EY audit of Thomas Cook","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.  It is EY’s turn in the Thomas Cook spotlight. The Financial Reporting Council confirmed on Tuesday morning it has started an investigation into the firm's audit of the failed tour operator for its final full financial year (to the end of September 2018). The probe will be conducted by the accounting watchdog’s enforcement division. EY is an obvious candidate for review. The firm signed off Thomas Cook’s 2018 annual report as a going concern in October, indicating they thought Thomas Cook could survive another year. By now we know it could not. Both PwC and EY have audited Thomas Cook in recent years. There is no word from the FRC as yet about whether it plans to formally investigate PwC's work as well, but the regulator says it plans to keep “under close review” both the scope of the EY investigation and “the question of whether to open any other investigation in relation to Thomas Cook”. Still, PwC — which audited Thomas Cook between 2008 and 2017 — should not get too comfortable. It faces a regulator keen to make a mark before its demise. Perhaps unfortunately for the Big Four, the FRC is doubling down on its efforts now that the body’s end is near. The FRC is due to be scrapped and replaced after a review last year found it was slow to investigate misconduct, too lenient on firms behaving badly and its board too close to the industry it was responsible for telling off. Briefly  Revolut, one of the leading lights of the UK fintech scene, is trumpeting its “viability”. This seems quite the comedown for an industry that is never knowingly underhyped — but entirely in keeping with the company’s desire to make itself look as boringly bank-like as possible in the wake of its disastrous “single-shaming” ad campaign earlier this year. Revolut made a pre-tax loss of £33m in 2018, up from £15m the previous year, but revenues rose quicker than expenses. PwC’s global results are out. They show just how desperate companies are for advice the world over. Full-year revenues were up 7 per cent year on year to $42.4bn, led by a 10 per cent increase at its advisory business, which generated $14.4bn. Headcount also increased 10 per cent, to a whopping 276,000. Bob Moritz, global chairman of PwC, said he believed recent changes to its UK business, such as splitting its audit and assurance business, were “sufficient” to convince MPs not to force a break-up of the Big Four. No mention of vegan sausage rolls in Greggs’ trading update on Tuesday: instead, the bakery chain is promoting its chipotle chilli steak and pumpkin spice lattes. Like-for-like sales were up 7 per cent in the third quarter of the calendar year, a slowdown from the 10.5 per cent pace of the first half, although total sales were up 12 per cent after the group added 56 net new stores. Greggs now has more than 2,000 outlets; more are planned with further expansion in the south of England after completion of a new distribution centre. One problem for Greggs, reckon analysts at Peel Hunt, is high pork prices. The Pru got whacked with a £24m fine on Monday after the Financial Conduct Authority found the UK insurer had failed to treat tens of thousands of retiring customers fairly. Prudential incentivised sales staff with perks that included spa breaks, as well as hefty bonuses. The FCA said that the Pru failed to ensure that customers who wanted to turn their pension pot into income or an annuity were told they may be able to get a better deal elsewhere between 2008 and 2017. In other corporate news on Tuesday there are results out from Ferguson, which is in the process of preparing to demerge its UK business, and a statement from JD Sports on the Competition and Markets Authority’s decision to refer its already-completed acquisition of the Footasylum shoe chain for a full investigation. Job Moves John Rogers, chief executive of Argos, is off to join ad agency WPP as its chief financial officer. He will leave on October 31 — handily saving him from dealing with any fallout from a no-deal Brexit should the UK depart the EU that day. Sainsbury’s, which owns Argos, does not appear to be directly replacing Mr Rogers. He was previously CFO of the supermarket chain and will not start his new role until early 2020.

 Beyond the Square Mile  A Credit Suisse executive has resigned following a corporate espionage affair that has become the Zurich-based lender’s worst reputational scandal in years. Pierre-Olivier Bouée, chief operating officer of Credit Suisse, stepped down on Tuesday. His departure came after a third-party investigation into the bank’s decision to spy on Iqbal Khan, its outgoing head of wealth management. The investigation “did not identify any indication” that chief executive Tidjane Thiam had approved or was aware of the observation of Mr Khan but said “the mandate for the observation . . . was wrong and disproportionate”. Saudi Arabia has boosted efforts to woo investors to the long-awaited stock market listing of Saudi Aramco by announcing an annual dividend of $75bn while scaling back global expansion plans at the oil company to increase cash flow. Riyadh is also planning to change state royalty payments and cut corporation tax as the kingdom pushes to secure a $2tn valuation for the state energy group, five people briefed on the matter said. PayPal has become the first foreign company to acquire a payments licence in China, after buying a majority stake in Chinese payments group Guofubao (Gopay). The deal makes PayPal the first foreign company to enter the Chinese payments market after two years of promises from Beijing that its financial services industry would be opened to overseas companies. WeWork has formally withdrawn its plan for an initial public offering, following a month of turmoil at the office space company. The decision by the company’s new management drew a line under an IPO process that started with hopes of topping a $47bn valuation and ended with the demotion of chief executive Adam Neumann.

"Hong Kong’s wealthy build cash piles as protests deepen","Rich residents’ cash holdings at highest level in a decade as recession fears grow","Hong Kong’s wealthy residents have boosted their cash holdings to multiyear highs as the trade war and political unrest fan fears of recession. Rich individuals in the city are holding close to a third of their total holdings in cash, a level not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, according to consultancy Capgemini.  Hong Kong’s family offices — the advisers that invest the wealth of the super-rich — have also turned to cash, with holdings at 12-14 per cent, according to research from UBS’s wealth management division and data provider Campden Wealth.  That is the highest level since the survey was launched in 2015 and is “considerably higher than the global average”, said Enrico Mattoli, head of Global Family Office in Greater China at UBS Wealth Management. Dr Rebecca Gooch, director of research at Campden Wealth, said: “Family offices are cautious about geopolitical tensions, and there is a widespread sense that we’re reaching the end of the current market cycle.” Of the Hong Kong family offices surveyed, 56 per cent anticipate a recession next year.  Hong Kong’s economy grew at its slowest annual pace since the financial crisis in the three months to June — figures that did not yet capture the impact of the unrest, prompting some analysts to predict that recession was imminent. For investors already grappling with the impact of the US-China trade war, Brexit and tension in the Middle East, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests were “another straw on the camel’s back”, said John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse. Demonstrations in the city have rumbled on for 19 weeks, with authorities failing to contain a movement organised around the kung-fu principle “be water”. Investors, as a result, have one more reason to be liquid, according to wealth managers. In its most recent survey of Hong Kong residents with more than $1m in investable assets, in the first quarter of this year, Capgemini found that cash made up 30.3 per cent of portfolio allocations, overtaking equities — at 28.7 per cent — for the first time since 2015. Those weightings echo trends last seen in 2008, a year in which global stocks took a beating. The proportion of cash holdings will probably have grown further over subsequent quarters this year, with wealthy investors “gradually moving to other conservative allocations like alternative investments, cash, and fixed income”, said Chirag Thakral, deputy head of market intelligence at Capgemini. Hong Kong’s stock market has struggled amid the street protests. The benchmark Hang Seng has lost 4.6 per cent since the end of July, when clashes between demonstrators and police took a violent turn. It is the world’s worst-performing developed market this year. A fall in global bond yields — $13.69tn of which are now in negative territory — has also burnished the appeal of cash, according to wealth managers.  Institutional investors, too, also asking for “highly liquid solutions”, said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-assets quant solutions for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas asset management. “They want something to hold on to until the time comes when they can invest.” ","15.10.2019"
"Coty plans sale of professional beauty division ","Shares rise as maker of Wella and Clairol aims to cut debt and focus on turnround","Cosmetics maker Coty is exploring the sale of its professional hair and nail products business, including Wella and Clairol, as it seeks to cut debt and simplify its structure after a series of setbacks at the company. Shares in the US-listed group rose nearly 15 per cent on news that Coty, which is majority owned by investment company JAB Holdings, had hired Credit Suisse to run a sale process for the units. The division caters to professional salons and is expected to generate $2.7bn in revenue this year. Other brands in the portfolio that Coty is putting up for sale include Good Hair Day (ghd) and OPI nail care products. It is also seeking to sell its Brazilian operation and aims to complete the sales by mid-2020. Coty hoped to fetch at least $8bn-$9bn from the transactions, one person added, and thought that rival companies in the sector and private equity bidders would be interested in all or parts of the businesses. The mooted sale is the latest effort by Coty’s backer JAB to fix the business, which has been among the weakest in a portfolio that also includes Keurig Dr Pepper and Pret A Manger. Coty botched the integration of its 2015 acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands for $12.5bn and was forced to write down a quarter of the value of the deal. It also suffered supply chain problems last year, prompting its share price to slide and JAB to replace management. Coty chief executive Pierre Laubies said the asset sales would “reposition Coty as a more focused and agile company, deleverage our balance sheet, and improve our ability to invest in areas with the greatest growth potential”.  If the professional business is sold Coty will be left with its consumer beauty division, which has been struggling with declining sales as mass-market brands such as CoverGirl lose favour with young buyers, and its luxury business that makes fragrances under licence.  The disposal would unload some of the P&G brands as well as undo a series of acquisitions going back to 2010. The professional division brought in about a fifth of Coty’s annual sales of $8.65bn in the year to the end of June.  Shares in Coty, which has net debt of $7.4bn, struggled over the past year and had fallen below the level of their 2013 initial public offering. Monday’s gains pushed its market value to $8.7bn. The company’s lower profit margins and weaker growth have left it trading at a significant discount to larger rivals L’Oréal and Estée Lauder, which have seen their shares rise 26 per cent and 47 per cent respectively in the past year.  The company said that proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to reduce its net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from more than 5 times to around 3 times. Additional proceeds would be returned to shareholders, including JAB. JAB, which manages the wealth of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, increased its shareholding in Coty to 60 per cent from 40 per cent in April as it attempted to draw a line under a difficult period. The problems at Coty also played a role in the departure of Bart Becht, a managing partner at JAB who left the group in January and who had previously served as Coty’s chairman. ","21.10.2019"

"Stocks to watch: Siltronic, Merck, Infineon, Cineworld, Experian","Earnings power looks to have peaked for Abramovich’s Evraz, says Citi","Tuesday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● Siltronic led Europe’s semiconductor stocks lower after its third profit warning of 2019, with the wafer maker blaming macro uncertainty and the US-China trade war for a significant drop in orders. The German company had previously warned that second-quarter revenue would be sharply below first-quarter levels, but guided for a second-half recovery. Instead, it said to expect that sales volumes would take another leg lower in the third quarter. Full-year sales would be down between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, rather than a previous target of 5 per cent to 10 per cent lower, Siltronic warned. The company also tempered guidance for margins and cash flow, implying a cut of about 11 per cent to the consensus operating earnings forecast.  “Siltronic’s third profit warning this year reflects the limited visibility in the sector. Given the high earnings sensitivity to changes in volumes and particularly prices, we remain cautious. Also, while Siltronic is likely to stop brownfield expansion in 2020, supply discipline at all players is not guaranteed.”Kepler Cheuvreux Credit Suisse highlighted the performance of 
Merck KGaA’s materials division, which provides 15 per cent of group sales. The broker also noted that Merck’s $5.8bn purchase of Versum Materials, approved yesterday by the US group’s shareholders, will significantly increase its exposure to the chip industry.  “Merck has always stated that it believes it is acquiring Versum towards the bottom of the semiconductor cycle and sees significant long-term growth potential in the industry. Any prolonged weakness in the semiconductor industry will clearly limit the near-term recovery and contribution of Versum,” said Credit Suisse. ● Infineon retreated after launching a private share placement to institutional investors to raise €1.5bn, with the proceeds intended to partially finance its €9bn purchase of US chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor. “The targeted takeover is yet to be approved by the authorities, with a closing of the deal expected at the end of 2019/early 2020. We are thus somewhat surprised by the rather timely capital increase. It seems to include a matter of urgency, highlighting the overall fragile market environment. Thus, we believe that the overall semi end-market environment has not improved.”Metzler Capital Markets Sellside stories ● Citigroup downgraded Evraz, the Russian steelmaker part-owned by Roman Abramovich, to “sell” from “hold” in an otherwise positive review of the sector. It kept “buy” ratings on Novolipetsk Steel, Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works and Severstal. Political risks — both internationally and domestically from higher taxes — appear to have eased since 2017 so Russian steelmakers deserve narrower risk discounts, Citi said. But Evraz is unlikely to capitalise on this as its earnings power has peaked and the company can no longer be relied on to beat consensus expectations, Citi said. “For the first time in years, we expect Evraz 1) to report steeply declining as opposed to steeply rising earnings; 2) to deliver earnings at or below consensus; while 3) the free cash flow premium to peers is extremely compressed compared to historical levels. The current gap is unsustainable taking into consideration what we view as a lower quality business coupled with greater financial and operational leverage and an inferior investment programme.”Citi ● In brief: Accor raised to “outperform” at Bernstein; Avesoro Resources cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Axel Springer cut to “neutral” at UBS; Bauer cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Cineworld rated new “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; Consort Medical cut to “hold” at Shore Capital; Danone upgraded to “outperform” at Davy; Derwent London cut to “underweight” at Barclays; Experian cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Homeserve cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; InterContinental Hotels cut to “underweight” at Barclays; Lufthansa downgraded to “hold” at HSBC and Société Générale; STMicroelectronics rated new “buy” at Société Générale.

"How India’s tallest building ended as an unfinished construction site","Bets on expensive property go bad in downturn, scaring off buyers and choking credit","It was meant to be the tallest building in India, with luxury flats, a swimming pool and cinema where billionaires and Bollywood stars could enjoy a life of perfect splendour looking down over the Mumbai skyline.  But the Palais Royale complex now sits unfinished alongside other partially built structures tangled in the megacity’s traffic-choked downtown streets, an apt symbol of a crisis that threatens a key part of India’s financial system. Over the past decade, some of India’s largest financial groups have bet big that the country’s fast-growing economy would breed a generation of rich bankers, lawyers and tech entrepreneurs eager to spend millions of dollars on luxury flats in the country’s largest cities.  A group of gutsy shadow banks willing to fund such projects were rewarded with roaring growth. These non-bank financial companies, like Palais Royale’s financier Indiabulls Housing Finance and other large groups like Dewan Housing Finance, soon became a big part of India’s financial system. Shadow banks grew to account for a fifth of all new credit last year, and became the largest source of funding for real estate thanks to loan growth of more than 20 per cent a year between 2013 and 2018.   But those bets on expensive property have now gone bad in an economic downturn, scaring off buyers and choking the flow of credit. That has left the real estate sector with a formidable mound of debt: developers collectively owe about Rs2.5tn ($37bn) to the non-bank financial sector.  “If the big players fail to get money,” said Sachchidanand Shukla, chief economist of the Mahindra Group conglomerate, “it can quickly have a domino effect. And that is the real scare.” Property consultancy Anarock estimates that half of the luxury real estate in Mumbai’s downtown alone is unsold: 11,000 properties worth a total Rs590bn.  Analysts say these billions of dollars stuck in illiquid luxury property now present a serious threat to India’s economic health.  “It has a massive impact,” said Ramesh Nair, India head of property consultancy JLL. “If the real estate economy doesn’t pick up, the overall country will be in trouble.”  Non-bank finance companies provide loans for everything from roads to housebuilding and new washing machines and cars for consumers. But the sector faced a reckoning in September when infrastructure group IL&FS defaulted on debt, prompting a government intervention dubbed India’s “Lehman moment”.   This episode highlighted how many of these companies had borrowed short-term money cheap and made a profit lending to developers over longer terms. After the danger of this mismatch became apparent, investors rushed to recover their money, prompting the banks and mutual funds that had fuelled the non bank sector’s growth to pull back.  In Mumbai, the glut of expensive housing has only increased. Unsold inventory in the city rose 14 per cent in the first half of 2019 from the same time a year earlier, according to Knight Frank. Indiabulls is now auctioning off Palais Royale to help recover Rs9.9bn from the developer. The property did not sell after an initial auction for a minimum price of about Rs8bn, prompting the company to lower its price closer to Rs7bn for a second auction in June. The company said it was evaluating bids. But two people familiar with the matter said that Indiabulls had homed in on a buyer, and the sale was entering its final stages. The vision for the project, started a decade ago, was spectacular. At more than 300 metres, Palais Royale was to be the tallest building in India with some 100 flats and amenities including a spa and cricket pitch, according to promotional videos and property websites.  “Everybody who is in industry, the captains of industry, booked an apartment there. All lawyers, bankers, industrialists — all of them have apartments there,” said Vishal Srivastava, Anarock’s head of corporate finance.   But progress was soon slowed by legal challenges over allegedly unauthorised features, sparking a series of delays. Indiabulls became involved in the project in 2011, refinancing a loan originally provided by a bank, but by 2016 — with the project still not finished and ongoing legal challenges — the company wrote off its investment as a non-performing asset. However grand the planned building, Palais Royale’s woes fit a familiar pattern: 30 per cent of real estate projects and half of all built-up space in Mumbai is under litigation, according to a 2019 Brookings India report, with projects taking an average of eight and a half years to complete.  Investors remain uneasy. Indiabulls’ share price has fallen 50 per cent from a peak in August, while the stock of major non bank financial company Dewan lost almost 90 per cent of its value over a similar period. Lending from mutual funds and others to the shadow banking sector remains muted. Debt levels at a group of real estate developers sampled by Credit Suisse, meanwhile, rose by 50 to 100 per cent in the past four years. “One risk is that, for real estate developers, the true magnitude of debt may be under-reported,” said Ashish Gupta, Credit Suisse’s head of India research. “Clearly the outlook isn’t great.”  Concerns that more defaults could spark contagion across Indian business have prompted repeated calls for the government to intervene and avoid a larger crisis. In early July, India’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would tighten regulation of non bank financial companies and create incentives for public-sector banks to boost lending to the sector.  Some life-long residents of Mumbai, meanwhile, lament the frenzy of construction that has gripped their city over the past decade, as apartment complexes mushroom in the city’s central neighbourhoods and push its already clogged roads and strained infrastructure to breaking point.  “They’ve built buildings which you can’t get to any more. The city is not able to keep up,” said one prominent billionaire industrialist. “It has just created this whole mess.” Developers race to build ever taller residential skyscrapers","14.07.2019"
"How the forces of finance fund MBAs","A detailed look at one educational lender.","In 2014, Credit Suisse launched its first higher education note. The product promised its wealth management clients social as well as financial returns. Impact investment, the bank explains on its website, ""can help underprivileged and talented students from low-income countries get loans for advanced education"". The notes, part of the Swiss bank’s suite of impact investment products, are based on the lending of Prodigy Finance, a rapidly-expanding company which helps international students pay for MBAs at prestigious business schools around the world. “We are predicting someone’s earning potential, and we are lending against that prediction,” says Cameron Stevens, chief executive and founder.  Prodigy, which has so far made $750m in loans, is a case study of an emerging relationship between higher education and the global financial industry. It also highlights the ties between universities and corporate recruitment, as well as the push from banks and asset managers to associate themselves with assets that provide a ""social benefit"". The lending process Prodigy's initial seed funding came from a competition at INSEAD, in 2006. In its early stages, the company relied on crowdfunding from the alumni network of the French business school, where Mr Stevens studied as an international student for his own MBA.  Last year, by contrast, it obtained $1bn in financing from Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, M&G, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and HSBC. It has also, as noted above, established a distribution relationship with Credit Suisse. Prodigy, emphasising the difficulty students can face when trying to borrow in a foreign country, only makes loans to international students (other companies, like CommonBond, lend domestically in the US). These loans usually pay for an MBA at a major business school, but can also fund graduate degrees in science and engineering. Once living costs are factored in, the cost of such a qualification can often exceed $100,000 a year. Prodigy, in most cases, caps its lending at 80 per cent of the total cost of attendance. An example, from its website in December, points out that at Columbia Business School in the first year, tuition is $74,400, but the total cost is $110,914. Prodigy would therefore lend up to $88,731. The investment case specifically relates to the nature of the degrees. One obvious advantage, for the company and its creditors, is that MBAs typically lead to high-paying jobs. MBA track recruitment — where large employers from the worlds of banking, tech and consulting hire directly from elite business schools — includes an additional benefit for lenders. When students are hired, they tend to receive a sign-on bonus which immediately gives them the option of significantly reducing their loan.   Data from Relish, a careers platform, says that three-quarters of candidates they survey now receive signing bonuses, compared to around 60 per cent around 2016. In investment banking, the average signing bonus across its data for an MBA recruitment process is $40,000. Though the signing bonuses from the most competitive US business schools can be much higher, closer to six-figures. If students receive large signing bonuses, they can use them to pay down a significant portion of their debt straight away. The debt was in turn was used to pay the business school fees, meaning both the student and the lender sit in between a flow of cash, from hiring company to university.  The bonus might therefore be thought as a kind of recruitment fee. This is just a particularly direct example of the student loan funding model in the first place: the idea is that the student funnels cash from future employment into the university. In this respect, part of a students' salary, via an MBA track, may also imply a recruitment fee, pre-paid to the university. The MBA model also pre-empts what it happening at universities in the US and the UK, where the pressures of high debt strengthen the need for students to find high-paying jobs, in turn emphasising the role institutions need to play in providing recruitment opportunities for their graduates. Prodigy is also able to benefit from the existing educational infrastructure. While other new fintech lenders must spend high amounts on marketing to attract borrowers, Prodigy is in a different position. “The universities act as your marketing channel,” says Mr Stevens. Impact investing Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Prodigy’s business model, though, is how it fits into a separate area of marketing: the ongoing boom in impact investing. These investments are often related to the environment, but the movement is increasingly involved in the financing of education (as we pointed out earlier this year in the case of philanthropic subsidies for student loan funding in the US).  Around $350m of Prodigy's loans have been funded through bonds, which are issued out of a special purpose vehicle in Ireland. Credit Suisse has purchased $165m of these bonds, packaged them into notes, and offered them to its wealth management clients. Credit Suisse frequently markets this education note as a central example of its role in the impact investing field. Here’s what is says on its website: In 2014, Credit Suisse launched the first-ever Higher Education Note, in collaboration with Prodigy Finance. Since then, the Higher Education Note has become a continuous product offering, enabling more than 2,500 talented students from underprivileged backgrounds in over 70 countries to access best-in-class universities. This impact investment gives investors access to a diversified portfolio of bonds linked to loans that are awarded to first-class students for the purpose of paying tuition fees for a masters degree at a top university. (These figures are from a few years ago - the most recent data includes 4,130 students from 115 countries). MBA degrees typically require a significant amount of initial capital, given the typical maximum loan of 80 per cent of cost (setting aside a few exceptions), and many students are already placed in high-paying careers before entering a course. So when we asked in what way the students were underprivileged, neither Credit Suisse nor Prodigy were able to explain the use of the term. The likelihood is that education will become further incorporated into the world of impact investing in future. One explanation for that boom in the first place is the anticipation of regulatory or tax incentives. If they do emerge, and the Credit Suisse note qualifies as providing a social benefit, then all of the various kinds of funding that touch on the educational industry will as well. This creates a powerful incentive to direct funding towards it, which might be welcomed by governments looking to curtail their own expenditure. This article has been updated since publication to provide more recent data than that available on the Credit Suisse website.","01.05.2019"
"Swiss regulator to fine banks $91m over foreign exchange cartel","Traders at Barclays, JPMorgan, Citi and RBS found to have rigged currency markets","Four British and US banks will be fined about SFr90m ($91m) this week by Switzerland’s competition authority for colluding to rig foreign exchange markets, weeks after the EU handed out €1bn of penalties for similar misconduct.
 Weko, as the Swiss regulator is known, found that traders at Barclays, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Royal Bank of Scotland worked together in a cartel-style arrangement to manipulate currency prices for their own gain, according to people briefed on the decision.  Staff also traded ahead of their own customers and failed to accurately represent to clients how they were determining prices, the people said. The four banks declined to comment. A spokesman for Weko also declined to comment. UBS escaped a fine because it blew the whistle on the other banks in the group, while Credit Suisse is fighting the allegations and refused to settle, the people said. The two Swiss banks also declined to comment on the probe. Last month the EU fined Barclays, Citi, RBS, JPMorgan and Japan’s MUFG €1bn after its own five-year investigation into manipulation of the $5tn-a-day forex market. UBS also escaped a fine in that probe for alerting authorities to the misconduct, and Credit Suisse is similarly fighting the EU’s case. Since allegations of benchmark currency rate manipulation first surfaced in 2013 more than a dozen financial institutions have paid almost $12bn in fines around the world. Weko, which is led by president Andreas Heinemann and director Patrik Ducrey, opened a probe into the banks in 2014 and said the fines could total as much as 10 per cent of the turnover generated in the relevant market in Switzerland over a set period of time. The Swiss foreign exchange market is much smaller than those in London, New York and across Europe with just over $200bn of transactions a day.","06.06.2019"
"‘Davos in the desert’ begins as Saudi Arabia seeks to put aside Khashoggi affair","Heavy-hitters to attend flagship gathering after several executives boycotted event last year","Five presidents and the heads of some of the world’s biggest banks and weapons makers are among those beating a path to Riyadh this week as Saudi Arabia uses its financial clout to lure heavyweights to its “Davos in the desert” conference. A year after the kingdom’s flagship annual investor meeting was boycotted by a host of executives in the wake of the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the veteran journalist, many of those who stayed away are back. The Public Investment Fund, the powerful sovereign wealth fund that organises the event, claims the third iteration of the Future Investment Initiative, which begins on Tuesday, will be the biggest yet. Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, is due to speak on a panel discussing what next for the US. The moderator will be Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman, one of the high-profile attendees who pulled out at the last minute last year. Other returning financiers include Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, and Tidjane Thiam, chief of Credit Suisse, according to a list of speakers. Another expected guest is Tom Barrack, executive chairman of Colony Capital and an ally of Mr Trump, who was forced to apologise after suggesting it was a “mistake” to criticise Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi’s killing. The murder of the journalist by Saudi agents in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul a year ago triggered Riyadh’s biggest diplomatic crisis since the 2001 attacks on the US. The CIA reportedly concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto leader, must have authorised the operation, which Riyadh blamed on a rogue operation. Prince Mohammed denied involvement but told CBS television last month that he took “full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia” as the kingdom tries to put the murder behind it. As the conference kicks off, the challenge for the crown prince is to turn the glitz and celebrity into inward investment as Riyadh struggles to deliver on an ambitious plan to overhaul its oil-dependent economy. “The conference showcases the kingdom’s willingness to open up for business and demonstrate its commitment to a new phase in its economic development,” said a senior banker. “But this is a third attempt to convince investors that the government will follow through this time. It will probably be met with scepticism as the kingdom continues to disappoint in implementing its stated targets, from boosting the private sector to selling off state assets in a timely manner.” Foreign direct investment into the kingdom has been at years-long lows and the economy is close to its second recession in three years, with the IMF this month slashing its 2019 growth forecast from 1.9 per cent to just 0.2 per cent. And attacks on the heart of the Saudi oil industry last month underlined the country’s geopolitical risks, causing ratings agency Fitch to downgrade the kingdom’s credit rating. Still, the prospect of fee-generating deals meant the bankers never really left, even after Khashoggi’s killing. Supporters of Jamal Khashoggi during a protest outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year days before authorities said he was killed. The journalist’s murder prompted several executives to boycott the PIF forum © AFP Financiers have continued to work on the delayed listing of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, with dozens of banks hired for a deal that could reap them hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. Saudi-owned television reported on Tuesday that Aramco would launch its initial public offering on November 3. The IPO was pulled last week at the last minute after international investors questioned the valuation of up to $2tn coveted by Prince Mohammed. In addition, the PIF, the vehicle for the crown prince to drive his economic reforms, is overseeing a raft of megaprojects across the kingdom, while also snapping up assets overseas. Karen Young, a Gulf expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said: “From a relationship perspective, there is a number of banks and boutique firms that have their own incentives to be in the kingdom. The [Saudi Aramco] IPO is one but there are a whole number of other deals, potential privatisations [and] restructurings that could be years of work and fees.” Weekly podcast

The PIF is expected to announce investment funds for both countries, one person briefed on the matter said. They will be joined by the presidents of Nigeria, Kenya, Congo-Brazzaville and Niger. Steven Mnuchin, US Treasury secretary, and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, are among the American attendees, who account for about 40 per cent of the speakers, double the number of Europeans and Asians. David Cameron, former UK prime minister, is also set to attend, along with Ernie Els, the South African golfer, and Terry Virts Jr, a former Nasa astronaut who will debate the future of space exploration. But there are also some notable absentees, including Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber who was among the first to pull out last year despite the PIF splashing out $3.3bn for a stake in the car-hailing app in 2016. The chief executives of several big banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are also not expected to attend. Instead, other senior executives will represent these institutions that have bagged top roles on the Saudi Aramco IPO.","29.10.2019"
"Deutsche Bank reaches $16.2m settlement with SEC over recruitment","Lender alleged to have hired relatives of officials in bid to win business in Russia and China","Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay $16.2m to settle civil allegations that for years it hired the relatives of government officials in order to win business in China and Russia. The German lender’s settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission makes it the latest bank to settle claims arising from a long-running investigation into Wall Street hiring practices. From 2006 to 2014, Deutsche Bank gave jobs to the children of rich and powerful officials “as a personal benefit to the officials in order to improperly influence them to assist the bank in obtaining or retaining business”, the SEC alleged on Thursday. Deutsche Bank neither admitted nor denied the allegations it had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the SEC, which said the lender received credit for its co-operation and remedial efforts. “Deutsche Bank provided substantial cooperation to the SEC in its inquiry and has implemented numerous remedial measures to improve the bank’s hiring practices,” said a spokesman for the bank. Although the trip lacked any legitimate business purpose . . . Deutsche Bank falsely recorded the trip as a legitimate business expenseSecurities and Exchange Commission The monies the bank has agreed to pay is significantly less than the $264m JPMorgan agreed to pay in 2016 in settlements with the SEC and the US Department of Justice.  It is also lower than the $77m deal Credit Suisse struck last year with US authorities. The US securities regulator cited five examples in its settlement with Deutsche Bank, including one son of a senior executive at a Russian state-owned entity who was a temporary employee at the lender’s Moscow office and requested a transfer to London. “FYI . . . the classic nepo situation that we have every year,” said a London-based human resources employee at the bank, according to the SEC. After just two months in London, the employee recommended the son be fired because “he failed to come to work, cheated on an exam, and was ‘a liability to the reputation of the programme, if not the firm…’,” the SEC alleged. In another case, Deutsche Bank hired the daughter of a “deputy minister” at a Russian government entity as an intern in Moscow and subsequently transferred her to London, the SEC claimed. “We must do it! We should have her in London as it is NOT politically correct to have her in Moscow!” the bank’s chief country officer in Russia told his supervisors in the UK, according to the SEC. Despite previously struggling to win business with the entity, 10 days after the transfer, “Deutsche Bank received a request for proposal signed by [her] father regarding a €2bn Eurobond issuance”, the SEC claimed. The chief country officer later went on holiday with the deputy minister, his wife, the daughter the bank had hired, and others, the regulator alleged. “Although the trip lacked any legitimate business purpose and was comprised solely of leisure activities including hunting, helicopter rides and fishing, Deutsche Bank falsely recorded the trip as a legitimate business expense,” the SEC alleged. “Shortly after the trip, Deutsche Bank submitted its bid for the transaction and was awarded the transaction,” the SEC added.","23.08.2019"
"Julius Baer appoints Philipp Rickenbacher as chief executive","Swiss private bank promotes head of intermediaries and global custody, sending shares down","Julius Baer has appointed a relatively unknown internal candidate as its new chief executive in a move that prompted a sell-off of the Swiss private bank’s shares.  The bank said it had handed the job to Philipp Rickenbacher following what it described as a “careful” evaluation of internal and external candidates.  Shares in the group responded negatively to the news and were trading 3.8 per cent lower by mid-afternoon in Zurich.  One person involved in Mr Rickenbacher’s appointment described the share price reaction as “completely normal”, adding: “If you have chosen a person who is not well known in public, there is always a bit of a doubt about who the guy is and what his credentials are.” Analysts at Vontobel, the Swiss investment bank, said the appointment of Mr Rickenbacher “might come to the surprise of some investors” but noted that Julius Baer had opted to recruit chief executives from within its own ranks in the past.  Julius Baer declined to say whether it had considered appointing Iqbal Khan, who resigned as head of wealth management at Credit Suisse last week following a power-struggle at the bank.  Mr Khan did hold talks with Julius Baer about becoming its chief executive, according to several people familiar with the discussions, and speculation that he was planning to join increased after he left Credit Suisse without announcing his next move.  Zurich-based Julius Baer said in a statement on Monday morning that Mr Rickenbacher, its head of intermediaries and global custody, would take over from Bernard Hodler on September 1.  Mr Hodler, who is retiring, had been chief executive since late 2017 when he replaced Boris Collardi, who moved to Swiss rival Pictet in a high-profile defection that rocked the industry.  Julius Baer, which manages SFr427bn of assets on behalf of clients, said at the time that Mr Hodler’s appointment was temporary until a long-term successor to Mr Collardi could be found.  Mr Rickenbacher, 48, has previously run Julius Baer’s advisory solutions business and has been with the company since 2004 when he joined from McKinsey. The Swiss private bank’s move to appoint Mr Rickenbacher was part of “long-term succession planning,” it said.  “For this appointment, the board of directors has carefully evaluated internal and external candidates,” said Romeo Lacher, Julius Baer’s chairman, in the statement.  “We are delighted that, with Philipp Rickenbacher, we have been able to appoint an internal candidate with a compelling leadership and industry track record, deeply familiar with Julius Baer’s culture and business, but prepared to actively address the challenges of the future.” The person involved in Mr Rickenbacher’s appointment said he would continue the strategy adopted by Messrs Hodler and Collardi, which has seen the bank expand rapidly by hiring relationship managers from rivals.  “We want further growth and will continue to hire relationship managers from the market,” the person said.  The bank also still intends to complete the disposal of Italian asset manager Kairos, they added. Mediobanca, the Italian bank, said in April that it was considering buying the business.

"Opening Quote: Sexual harassment survey points to deep problems at Lloyd’s of London","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.  Lloyd’s of London has a women problem — and not just because a series of high profile female executives have left in the past year. Lloyd’s knows this. Inga Beale, the woman who as chief executive until last year tried to reform its culture and diversify the insurance market, knew it. Pretty much everyone knew it, even before a Bloomberg story earlier this year catalogued its anachronisms. After a year in the top job, John Neal is trying to work out just how large the problem is (though announcing the departure of the fourth senior woman in 18 months does not help reassure that it is being solved). In the wake of sexual harassment allegations earlier this year, Lloyd’s commissioned a survey from the Banking Standards Board. More than 6,000 people responded. Of those, almost 500 said they had witnessed sexual harassment over the past year. A fifth said people in their organisations turned a blind eye to inappropriate behaviour. Less than half who raised a concern felt they were taken seriously.  The market has a new set of standards to better tell individuals and businesses what is expected of them. But you shouldn't need standards to know not to sexually harass people. More promising is the threat to throw out the bad apples, whether individuals or firms. So far, however, only two people have been expelled by the market for their behaviour since the harassment allegations came up in March, which looks fairly abysmal when held up alongside the almost-500 who have witnessed sexual harassment. The survey will be repeated again next year. Mr Neal has a whole host of other reforms to institute at Lloyd’s, to boost cost-cutting, improve efficiency and win business. To achieve those would not be enough. Next year's survey needs to show Lloyd’s is no longer an anachronism.  Briefly After the collapse comes the flood of recriminations. Thomas Cook is in compulsory liquidation, holidaymakers are being flown home, and now the finger-pointing starts in earnest. After presiding over the collapse of the 178-year old tour operator, management now face a government-backed investigation into whether their actions caused ""detriment to creditors"" or the group's pension schemes after Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, wrote to the Insolvency Service demanding one. Other potential villains include banks who demanded the company find an extra £200m to get it through winter, bondholders who threatened to block a restructuring deal and Thomas Cook's largest shareholder, Fosun.  Consumers who borrow on credit cards often lack a better option. Borrowing costs — interest rates — on balances are now at their highest level for 13 years. The situation is not altogether different from that of Metro Bank. The high-street challenger bank has to raise new debt before the end of the year. But its borrowing costs have soared in the wake of its misreporting scandal. It offered a tantalising yield of 7.5 per cent on a senior unsecured bond issue yesterday, but still couldn't tempt enough investors. Metro pulled the issue, which had been seeking to raise between £200m and £250m, but only received £175m of orders by mid-afternoon.  One less competitor should be good news for Tui, which has a scheduled trading update out this morning. The travel group does not want to sound too optimistic: its guidance for the year was already for underlying earnings to fall 26 per cent in the wake of 737 Max debacle — but it has reassured that its business model is ""resilient"". It could take a short term hit from Thomas Cook's failure. Some of its customers are booked on Thomas Cook Airlines flights. Analysts and investors are still betting on Tui gaining, however. Its share price was up 6 per cent yesterday as Barclays' analysts forecast that if Tui picked up £2bn of lost Thomas Cook revenue it could add 4 per cent to group trading profit.  Also out today are first-half results from breakdown provider the AA. Last year profits took a hit from a refinancing, which landed AA with a hefty early repayment charge. Lower financing costs have helped boost reported pre-tax profits by 50 per cent to £42m, though on an underlying basis they fell 8 per cent, to £46m. Roadside assistance membership, which had been falling, has stabilised. Its insurance business has expanded its customer base — by 22 per cent in motor policies — but that meant lower income per policy. Overall revenues were up 2 per cent to £491m.  Other retailers reporting this morning include Card Factory, Moss Bros and Hotel Chocolat. Job moves Close Brothers’ chief executive Preben Prebensen is stepping down after a decade at the helm of the bank. He has decided it is time to ""move on to the next stage of his career"", Close Brothers says, though he will stay for another 12 months to smooth the handover to his unnamed successor. In the first five years of his tenure, the share price had a decent run. But it has largely been treading water since. Another long-serving director is also moving on, this time at brewer Shepherd Neame. Miles Templeman is stepping down after 15 years in the chair and 18 years as a director. He will be succeeded by Richard Oldfield, currently a non-executive at the group, at the company's AGM in October next year. We're looking to feature more job moves.

"SoftBank executives baulk at big loans to invest in Vision Fund","Some staff have been encouraged to fund stakes by borrowing more than 10 times their salary","Some SoftBank executives are baulking at taking on large personal loans to buy into the Japanese group’s portfolio of technology companies, an investment scheme described internally as a test of loyalty to founder Masayoshi Son. The scheme encourages participants to take a huge personal bet on SoftBank’s $97bn Vision Fund — the vehicle which has come under intense scrutiny after the collapse in value of WeWork, the shared office provider that is one of its bigger investments. SoftBank offers the loans on a sliding scale depending on salary and length of tenure. Some executives have been encouraged to borrow more than 10 times their base salary, according to people familiar with the situation. Participation is not obligatory, according to people close to the company, but some employees worry that opting out of it may hurt their career. Given the bullish persona of Mr Son, and the culture that pervades SoftBank, several executives have said they understand it is “expected” that they will take out the loans, despite what many perceive to be the high risk of doing so. As SoftBank has sought to build record war chests for tech investment, it has relied on employees for a significant contribution. They accounted for about $5bn of the first fund*. People familiar with discussions said they had been allocated more than $15bn of the second Vision Fund, which has a headline value of $108bn but few confirmed outside investors.  The loans are being offered to a large number of senior executives across the group. Under the scheme, executives are offered loans from a UK-based subsidiary of SoftBank, Triangle Lender, which lists Mr Son’s top lieutenant Rajeev Misra as a director. The outsized loans have been offered as the primary way for senior executives to invest in the Vision Fund. People familiar with the scheme said that executives were actively discouraged from investing their own cash.  The employee concerns about the loans come as the perceived risks of technology investing of the sort championed by the Vision Fund appear to have risen sharply. Veteran asset managers have described the sudden plunge in the pre-IPO valuation of WeWork as a potential signal that the Vision Fund may now carry writedown risks. A large part of the employee contributions are funded personally by Mr Son, known for his debt-fuelled dealmaking. The billionaire founder has already pledged 38 per cent of his shares in SoftBank as collateral for personal loans from 19 financial groups globally including Mizuho, Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and Switzerland’s J Safra Sarasin, according to a filing in June.  A Vision Fund spokesperson said the scheme was “designed to ensure strong alignment of interests between key staff and our limited partners”.  
*Although employees were estimated to have contributed $8bn to the first fund, the final figure was $5bn. This article has been changed to reflect that fact, and to include comment from the Vision Fund provided after publication.

"Kazakh fintech group plans London IPO","Kaspi.kz expects $500m listing to value the company at $5bn","A Kazakh fintech group is planning a London listing that would be the biggest initial public offering by a central Asian company since the global financial crisis. Kaspi.kz, which offers payments, an ecommerce marketplace and a finance platform through an integrated app, said on Monday it would sell existing shares on the London Stock Exchange in the form of global depositary receipts, subject to market conditions. While the group declined to provide the listing size, one person close to the talks said the company was expected to achieve a $5bn valuation with a minimum offering of $500m worth of GDRs. The listing is expected to complete in October or November, the person added.  The company is part-owned by Baring Vostok and Goldman Sachs, both of which will sell some of their shares in the IPO.  We are a big innovative company, and we are doing so much for the country, digitising the country, so we see a lot of growth potentialMikhail Lomtadze, chief executive The IPO would be a boost for the LSE, where some companies have been reluctant to list given uncertainty over Brexit. Kaspi.kz chose London over New York because “investors in this part of the world are closer to Kazakhstan and understand it better”, Mikhail Lomtadze, chief executive and a big Kaspi shareholder, told the Financial Times. The listing would be the first London IPO by a Kazakh company since the market debut in November of Kazatomprom, the world’s largest uranium producer. In February KazMunaiGas, the country’s state-run oil and gas company, delayed a joint London and local listing that was set to raise as much as $6.5bn and value the company at $25bn-$26bn. Listings by other Kazakh state-owned companies, including Air Astana and telecoms provider Kazakhtelecom, have faced long delays because of unfavourable market conditions. Mr Lomtadze said market conditions were suitable for it to list, highlighting the company’s sustained growth.  “The markets are pretty good, capital markets are good enough, and we have fantastic growth,” he said, noting high investor interest in innovative technology companies with growth potential both in Kazakhstan and overseas.  “Kazakhstan itself is an extremely underpenetrated market, a growing market, innovating with new services,” he said. “And in the future, we want to be a company that exports technology — to central Asia and the Caucasus.” The group’s net income jumped 54 per cent to $203m in the first six months of 2019 compared with the same period a year ago.  “We are a big innovative company, and we are doing so much for the country, digitising the country, so we see a lot of growth potential. There is a very strong correlation between GDP growth and digitisation. And the country has a good macro story with annual growth of 4.1 per cent over three years,” Mr Lomtadze said. Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup and Credit Suisse are joint co-ordinators of the offering, and joint bookrunners along with Renaissance Capital.","16.09.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Bayer, IWG, WPP, Glanbia","Adidas management bonuses may cap profit growth, says Kepler","Friday 13:00 GMT What’s happening ● Bayer climbed on a report that it had proposed paying between $6bn and $8bn to settle 18,000 lawsuits over its Roundup pesticide. Lawyers for the plaintiffs were reported to be wanting $10bn. The report came shortly before Bayer confirmed that a Roundup case due to be heard next month in St Louis had been postponed.  Any settlement “would unlock the uncertainty discount around the exploding number of litigation cases and enable a potential clean split of the company,” said Bernstein Research, which estimated $30bn of legal costs priced into Bayer’s shares. A settlement at the reported levels could be worth more than €20 a share, it estimated. ● WPP led the FTSE 100 gainers after its quarterly organic sales and margins beat expectations, thanks largely to an improved US performance. Group second-quarter net organic revenue fell 1.4 per cent rather than the 3 per cent reduction expected by the market as North American losses decelerated after four consecutive quarters of deterioration.  “We believe these results demonstrate the progress of WPP’s turnaround plan and should be taken positively given recent mixed results from peers especially in the US which led the stock to underperform the sector by 11 per cent over the last month,” said Goldman Sachs.  “With the impact of client losses ebbing, investors are likely to have increased confidence in WPP’s ability to make its guidance for the year,” said Morgan Stanley. ● IWG, the owner of Regus serviced offices, rose after announcing a second major strategic partnership with TKP Corporation. Similar to an earlier deal announced in April for its Japanese business, IWG said it would divest Taiwanese operations to TKP and sign an exclusive master franchise agreement. It agreed a price for the unit of £22.7m, equivalent to 3.3 times sales and 16.2 times operating earnings. “This multi-brand deal demonstrates that the Japan deal, and associated valuation multiples, are not a one-off, and that there is good momentum behind franchising . . . We believe the development of franchising has the potential to transform investors’ perception of value. Whilst the stock re-rated on the back of the Japan transaction in April 2019, we expect the completion of more franchising deals, particularly in the US and UK, to provide a further catalyst for the share price.”Stifel Sellside stories ● Morgan Stanley upgraded Glanbia from “underweight” to “overweight” €14.50 following a profit warning last month from the food supplements maker. A combination of de-risked consensus expectations and a valuation of just 11.6 times 2020 earnings has created a compelling opportunity for long-term investors, it said. “Glanbia is not yet a pure play on global nutrition with 30 per cent of the business in cheese. But we believe that this is the direction of travel. The shares offer exposure to the $1tn global health and wellness market, growing mid-single digits with largely untapped potential in emerging markets. At these levels the shares look like a long-term call option on increasing middle class personal fitness spend globally, one of the few remaining stocks offering this kind of trend on cheap valuations.”Morgan Stanley ● Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded Adidas from “buy” to “hold” with a €220 target. It highlighted that market expectations are more bullish than those set for management by the 2019 and 2020 long-term incentive programme. “Adidas shares appreciated by 50 per cent year to date on the back of the company delivering strong numbers on a regular basis, as well as a solid balance sheet, well-regarded management, underlying market growth and an outstanding share buyback programme. However, we think the balance of corporate strategy, consensus estimates and valuation multiples have gone out of bounce, especially as we think the company has no incentive to materially overachieve on its 2020 [earnings] margin target of 11.5 per cent. Adidas has good projects and products in the pipeline which require investments so that they will support future growth. However, consensus assumes a 12 per cent margin in 2020, which we think is too high.”Kepler Cheuvreux ● In brief: Atlantia raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Carlsberg raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Deutsche Post rated new “underweight” at JPMorgan; Hapag-Lloyd cut to “reduce” at HSBC; Italgas cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; MorphoSys raised to “outperform” at RBC; Paradox Interactive rated new “buy” at Jefferies; SGL cut to “hold” at Berenberg; STMicroelectronics raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; STS cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Saipem raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Schoeller-Bleckmann cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Telefónica cut to “neutral” at UBS; Terna cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Tikkurila cut to “hold” at SEB Equities; Vivo Energy raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Voestalpine cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan.

"Stocks to watch: Beyond Meat, BAT, Sage, 888, Bpost, Royal Mail","Price hikes suggest fears around US cigarette sales are overplayed, says JPMorgan","Friday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Beyond Meat hit a record high after raising full-year guidance, giving it a threefold gain since its Nasdaq float last month. The vegan burger maker lifted what management called a “very conservative” year-end sales target to at least $210m, suggesting growth of 140 per cent from 120 per cent previously, and predicted reaching earnings break-even before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Maiden results from Beyond Meat were modestly ahead of forecasts, with first-quarter sales of $40.2m — up 215 per cent year on year. JPMorgan raised its target price on Beyond Meat to $120 from $97 and repeated “overweight” advice. Consensus forecasts have failed to reflect the “extraordinary revenue and profit potential” offered by Beyond Meat, it said. “We understand why current valuation metrics spook many investors, and we want to respect the limits to Beyond Meat’s potential. Nothing grows forever. But the guidance in today’s press release, as well as the extremely positive tone from management on the call and afterwards in our follow-up, give us reason to believe the story still has legs.”JPMorgan Credit Suisse put a $125 target on Beyond Meat, up from $70 previously, but kept a “neutral” rating. It saw as “hugely important” evidence of Beyond Meat products delivering same-store sales growth for Burger King and diner chain A&W Restaurants, “because it means that the brand is driving same-store foot traffic rather than just cannibalising existing sales”. Beyond Meat excludes from its guidance customers that are only in the test phase, Credit Suisse also highlighted. “We expect revenue guidance to keep revising higher this year as the big chains like Tim Horton’s transition out of test and into full market distribution. We now expect $750mn of sales to McDonald’s alone by 2030.” Credit Suisse forecast Beyond Meat to deliver $2bn in sales by 2026 and set its price target at six times that total. Competition was the company’s biggest threat, it said.  Sellside stories ● JPMorgan Cazenove repeated “overweight” advice on British American Tobacco with a £40 target. Fears around a collapse in US cigarette revenues and slowing uptake of e-cigarettes look to have been overdone, it said. With the main tobacco companies acting rationally, resilient cigarette pricing should support profits in spite of worsening sales by volume, JPMorgan said. It expected US cigarette sales by volume to fall 4.8 per cent this year but saw profit per pack rising 7 per cent. And while overall sales of vapour pipes were slowing “given the lower inflows of underage vapers”, BAT appears to have been winning market share having flagged good momentum for its own range at a 2019 capital markets day, the broker said. It also highlighted that BAT had a pre-close update due on June 12.  ● Deutsche Bank cut Sage, the accountancy software maker, to “sell” from “hold” with a 650p target. A valuation of 24 times 2020 earnings was nearly on par with peers in spite of higher execution risks, it said. “Sage has made good progress in transitioning to a subscription revenue model. However, we foresee recurring revenue growth slowing from here as some of the initial boost factors from a subscription transition fade. We believe that SGE is now entering a new phase, where the quick wins from low-hanging fruit are fading, and the company now needs to focus on organic product development to sustain growth in the future. In our view, this will unavoidably result in a sustained rise in Sage’s historically low level of research and development investment and operating margin pressure.”Deutsche Bank R&D costs meant growth in Sage’s organic earnings per share and free cash flow were unlikely to exceed low- to mid-single-digit percentages over the medium term, well below the software peer group average, Deutsche said. “Given Sage’s historically somewhat indifferent execution around product development, investors are unlikely to automatically assume that there will be a payback that sufficiently compensates for this relatively meagre outlook.” ● JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded 888, the Gibraltar-based online casino operator, to “overweight” with a 220p price target following a capital markets day this week. The company’s UK consumer-facing business had been turned around, with 24 per cent like-for-like growth in the year to date thanks to a successful pivot towards the mass market recreational gamblers rather than high rollers, said JPMorgan. It said VIPs made up less than 10 per cent of 888’s customer base, from between 35 and 40 per cent previously, which better positions the company to deliver sustainable growth. JPMorgan forecast 2019 to be a trough year for 888’s earnings due to tax hikes and shrinking revenue from the poker and business-to-business lines. The broker also highlighted integration costs from the acquisition in March of Irish-based Betbright. But high operating leverage means 888’s like-for-like growth will eventually drop through to operating earnings, while costs fall as Betbright phases out its current betting services provider Kambi, the broker said. And because 888 owns and controls all aspects of its offer, the company has a difficult-to-replicate advantage over peers that use third-party providers, it said. ● In brief: Ascential rated new “outperform” at Macquarie; Bpost cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Centrica rated new “hold” at Société Générale; Compass cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Deutsche Wohnen cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Jyske cut to “sell” at Nordea; Pets at Home cut to “hold” at HSBC; Royal Mail cut to “hold” at HSBC; Ryanair upgraded to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Software AG raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse.

"Jefferies hires former CLSA chief Jonathan Slone as Asia chairman","Hiring comes as US investment bank expands in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia","US investment bank Jefferies said on Monday that it had appointed Jonathan Slone, the former chief executive of beleaguered Asian securities house CLSA, as its new chairman for Asia. Mr Slone abruptly quit as head of CLSA in March, following three decades at the Hong Kong brokerage. That came amid signs of a mounting culture clash between CLSA and its Chinese government-owned parent Citic Securities.  In his new role at Jefferies, Mr Slone will focus on managing Jefferies’ major relationships in investment banking and trading throughout the region. 
 “The hiring of Jonathan represents a significant step in our continued expansion of our Asia footprint, including meaningful additions to our teams in Japan and Hong Kong, as well the addition of equities research, sales and trading in Australia,” said Peter Forlenza, Jefferies’ global head of equities. Mr Slone is just one of a number of profile executives to leave CLSA in recent months, including former chairman Tang Zhenyi and chief operating officer Nigel Beatty. Mr Tang recently joined Credit Suisse as its chief executive for China.  The path from CLSA to Jefferies appears to be becoming a well-trodden one. Aside from Mr Slone, CLSA’s former global head of equity strategy, Christopher Wood, and Desh Peramunetilleke, who was head of microstrategy, have both joined Jefferies in recent weeks. ","15.07.2019"
"Hong Kong charges former JPMorgan banker over bribery","Watchdog alleges executive offered businessman’s son a job to secure work on his company’s IPO","Hong Kong’s corruption watchdog has charged 
JPMorgan Chase’s former vice-chairman of Asian investment banking with bribery connected to the bank’s hiring of well-connected Chinese “princelings” as a means of winning business in the country. The Independent Commission Against Corruption said on Thursday that it had charged former JPMorgan managing director Catherine Leung with bribing the chairman of a logistics company in 2010. The ICAC alleges that Ms Leung offered the businessman’s son employment at JPMorgan in order to help the US bank secure work on the company’s initial public offering. JPMorgan’s so-called “sons and daughters programme” sought to hire the children of some of China’s elite businesspeople and government officials, often referred to as “princelings”. The recruits typically joined the bank as junior members of staff. “Senior staff at or above the rank of executive director or managing director, such as the defendant, could refer candidates to JPM or [JPM Securities] for the junior post of analyst or associate,” ICAC said in a statement. The strategy was designed to help banks clinch lucrative deals in China but the practice was also in potential breach of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies from paying bribes to overseas officials to win business. In 2016 JPMorgan agreed to pay $264m to settle an investigation into the matter by the US Department of Justice.  Ms Leung, 51, left JPMorgan in 2015. She faces two charges of offering an advantage to an agent and has been released on bail before a court appearance on Monday. She could not be reached for comment. Other global investment banks — Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley — have also been contacted by regulators in connection with similar hiring practices. At the time, some western investment banks employed the children of some of China’s most powerful politicians. Credit Suisse, for example, once counted Wen Ruchun, the daughter of former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, as an employee, the Financial Times reported in 2013. Ms Wen, who went by the English name Lily, also worked for Lehman Brothers. Last year Credit Suisse agreed to pay $47m to settle a DoJ probe into its hiring of princelings. Hong Kong’s corruption watchdog did not identify the logistics company allegedly involved, saying only that the JPMorgan banker conducted the activities during 2010 and 2011. JPMorgan is known to have made several high-profile hires at the time that the employment programme was active, including Gao Jue, the son of a Chinese commerce minister, who was later employed by Goldman Sachs. Tang Xiaoning, the son of a former bank regulator, was also hired by JPMorgan. He who went on to chair Everbright Group, one of China’s largest financial conglomerates. Ms Leung’s case is an “historical case, which JPMorgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016”, a spokesperson for the bank said. “We strengthened our compliance procedures and controls around hiring and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.” ","16.05.2019"
"Inflation data do not support Fed move to cut interest rates","Weakness in financial services is skewing bank’s preferred measure of price growth"," Jay Powell, Federal Reserve chairman, is poised to cut interest rates next week, because the US central bank says it wants to boost sluggish inflation. But parts of Wall Street are not convinced that price growth is really as weak as the Fed claims. Certainly, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, has been flashing a worrisome signal since the turn of the year. The core “personal consumption expenditure index” (PCE) has slowed considerably, having breached the central bank’s 2 per cent target in July last year and hovered near those levels through to December. Some Fed officials, including Mr Powell, have made much of this softening, using it as one of the main reasons why America needs looser monetary policy. But according to James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse, the inflation picture is not as gloomy as headline figures suggest. He notes that core PCE has fallen largely because of weakness in financial services — a category that includes insurance, fund-management costs and fees for using a cash machine. Financial services has the smallest weighting of the five components among the core PCE index, at 8.5 per cent, but it is the most volatile, notes Mr Sweeney, contributing much of the recent decline. Add to this some robust retail sales figures and a better-than-expected jobs report in June and the conclusion seems clear, he said: the notionally data-dependent Fed does not have the data it needs to justify a rate cut. colby.smith@ft.com

"Revolut bolsters senior team with banking executives","Challenger bank appoints new treasurer, deputy CFO and director of financial crime risk","Revolut has hired a trio of executives from Deutsche Bank, ClearBank and rival N26 in an effort to strengthen its senior team as it attempts to switch from a start-up focused on travel money to a “global bank”. The company on Friday named a new treasurer, deputy chief financial officer and director of financial crime risk, the latest in a wave of senior executive appointments that have also included a new chief financial officer and chief operating officer. The company, which launched in 2015 with a prepaid debit card offering cheap currency exchange, has since attracted more than 6m users and expanded into new areas such as stock trading and business accounts. Its recent hiring spree has been particularly focused on bringing in staff with more experience in traditional banking after critics suggested it was struggling to cope with its rapid growth. The trend continued with Friday’s announcements. Wolfgang Bardorf, who will become its new treasurer, is a former executive director at Goldman Sachs and is currently global head of liquidity models and methodologies at Deutsche Bank. Revolut’s new director of financial crime risk, Philip Doyle, was previously head of financial crime at ClearBank, a clearing bank founded in 2017, and fraud prevention manager at Visa. Stefan Wille will join as deputy CFO after serving as senior vice-president of finance at N26 and corporate finance manager at Credit Suisse. Nik Storonsky, Revolut chief executive, said: “This year we’ve made some exceptional senior appointments to the company. As we continue to strengthen our existing governance and processes we’ve hired some of the most talented professionals, with many years’ experience, delivering world-class business practices.”  In addition to the executive appointments, Revolut has hired several senior figures to its board, and is poised to add City veteran Martin Gilbert as chairman and ex-Goldman Sachs executive Michael Sherwood as a non-executive director.  The company was valued at $1.7bn in its most recent fundraising last year, but is aiming to raise up to $500m at a higher valuation before the end of 2019. Richard Davies, Revolut’s new chief operating officer, said last month that it would use the money to speed up customer growth and support its capital position as it aims to secure new banking licences in several markets.  Revolut received a banking licence in the eurozone last year, but has yet to begin actively lending unlike rival start-ups Monzo and N26.","23.08.2019"
"Goldman’s pipeline of advisory business is climbing. What that means for its rivals is a question on DD’s mind","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. ’Tis the season, earnings season.  Two of Wall Street’s most prolific advisers on mergers and acquisitions reported quarterly results on Tuesday, offering a window into how lenders are performing as global dealmaking cools. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase showed declining investment banking revenue in the second quarter of 2019, with both suffering a dip in their lucrative debt underwriting businesses.     
  JPMorgan’s investment banking revenue fell by 14 per cent from the previous year to $1.85bn, while Goldman reported a 9 per cent slide to $1.86bn. JPMorgan’s M&A business suffered a sharper 16 per cent year-on-year contraction — it generated $525m in fees — as Goldman was off just 3 per cent from the previous year at $776m. Goldman and JPMorgan have been going back-and-forth at the top of the M&A league table, granted that is based on deal volume and not fees generated (as evidenced by the chart above).  The two banks have landed on some of the biggest deals of the year, with JPMorgan advising on the $90bn tie-up between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene and Goldman providing advice to Allergan on its $85bn takeover of AbbVie. US-based investment bankers should count their blessings. They’ve had front seats to some of the biggest deals in the world while their European counterparts have mostly sat on their hands as the deal pipeline has dried up.  The decline in European dealmaking has meant US groups such as JPMorgan and Goldman have won a larger share of the fees generated by M&A.  Goldman noted that its backlog of advisory work had climbed “slightly” by the end of the quarter, meaning it could be in a good position in the second half of the year.  JPMorgan’s chief financial officer was slightly less sanguine, calling the investment banking pipeline “healthy, though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year”. JPMorgan didn’t break out its M&A backlog, so for now we can only guess what it’s at work on. To go deeper into the two banks results, read our stories here. Results from Citigroup and Wells Fargo are available here and here. Go deeper with the Lex column.  Deutsche Bank: the ties that bind  Who is Stefan Simon, Deutsche Bank’s soon-to-be head of legal and regulatory affairs?  The 49-year-old former corporate lawyer (pictured above) has gone from advising Germany’s largest lender on the Libor rate-rigging scandal, to becoming one of the most influential figures at the troubled bank.  Simon’s climb up the Deutsche corporate ladder started with Michele Faissola, once the bank’s global head of rates. The lawyer supported Faissola during the Libor investigation, apparently impressing him with his legal expertise.  Faissola left the bank in 2015, after John Cryan took over as chief executive with no love lost between the two. The controversial investment banking veteran then became an adviser to Qatar’s al-Thani royal family, who are the bank’s largest shareholder.  When a seat on Deutsche’s supervisory board became vacant in 2016, Faissola recommended Simon to Qatar, who in turn suggested that the lawyer should join the lender as a supervisory board member. And the rest is history.  Next month Simon will swap his non-executive job for a pivotal role at Deutsche, whose reputation has been battered by misconduct and shortfalls in compliance and anti-money laundering.  Simon’s unconventional path to Deutsche’s management board has raised flags for some experts, however, who say it’s at odds with the basic principles of Germany’s two-tier board system.  As for Faissola, he’s been cleared by German regulators of any wrongdoing on Libor but Italian prosecutors are still holding out on other charges. He is embroiled in a Milan lawsuit over allegations of falsifying the accounts of the troubled Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena between 2008 and 2012, allegations he denies. Get smart with this Bloomberg read from two years ago. The FT’s Olaf Storbeck has all the details here.  How low can US rates go? There’s one talisman that investors have used for decades to determine where the US economy is going: the yield curve.  An inversion, where the 10-year US Treasury bond trades at a lower yield than three-month bills, has preceded every American downturn since the end of the second world war. Hedge fund manager Kyle Bass (pictured below) thinks this time is no different.    
  Bass, who rose to prominence through prescient bets against the US housing market, Greece and Iceland, thinks interest rates are going to go to zero next year and the Federal Reserve will have a hard time getting them back up.  “As we’ve all learned, once an economy falls into the tractor beam of zero rates, it’s almost impossible to escape them,” he told the Financial Times. Bass called the lack of inflation despite a strong economy a “head scratcher”.  Investors expect that the US central bank will cut interest rates when it meets later this month, as a pre-emptive measure to ward off headwinds of trade tensions and slowing global economic growth. Fed chairman Jay Powell’s more sombre attitude towards financial markets has caused concern among banks who lend to everyday Americans.  More here from the FT’s Ortenca Aliaj and Robin Wigglesworth.

"Safran raises growth forecasts as results beat expectations","French aerospace supplier’s sales boosted despite grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max","Sales and income at Safran, the world’s third largest aerospace supplier, have beaten market expectations, helping the French company raise growth forecasts for the rest of the year despite the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max. “It’s the first time I have seen all of our businesses going in the same direction,” Safran chief executive Philippe Petitcolin said. Sales at the Paris-based company in the first half came in at €12.1bn, up 27.3 per cent over the same period last year and 3 per cent ahead of analyst expectations.  Recurring operating income hit €1.9bn, a gain of 35.9 per cent over last year and 11 per cent ahead of expectations.  Safran’s shares gained 7 per cent by the close of trade on Thursday in Paris. They have risen more than 30 per cent this year. Sales and income were driven mostly by the group’s propulsion and aircraft interiors divisions, said analysts. Safran took over airline interiors company Zodiac Aerospace for €8.5bn in 2017.
 “Zodiac is in line with what we were expecting. Maybe we had been a bit conservative about interiors last quarter,” said Mr Petitcolin, who has had his term extended until December 2020 to allow for a successor to be found.  The group also increased its full-year guidance, including full-year revenue that is now forecast to be 15 per cent versus 7 to 9 per cent previously and a doubling of the rate of underlying revenue growth to 10 per cent. That suggests, said Credit Suisse, an updated operating income of €3.7bn versus consensus at €3.52bn and a free cash flow range of €1.8bn to €2.05bn versus consensus at €1.7bn. The increase in free cash flow comes despite Safran saying that the impact on cash generation of the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max is expected to be about €300m per quarter versus the €200m estimated in the first quarter of the year. The Max was grounded in March after two crashes in five months. Forecasts of Safran, which produces engines for Boeing through a joint venture with General Electric called CFM International, are based on the Max being back in the air by the fourth quarter of this year. “We feel confident today that by the fourth quarter the regulatory agencies, and particularly the US agencies, will have given the green light to fly again,” said Mr Petitcolin. The Safran boss was due to step down at the next annual general meeting in the summer of 2020.  When asked about possible candidates, Mr Petitcolin said that he had been an internal appointment “and I would like it to continue in that way”.","05.09.2019"

In its filing, Alibaba said the proposed stock split “will increase the number of shares available for issuance at a lower per-share price, and the Board of Directors believes that this will increase flexibility in the Company’s capital raising activities, including the issuance of new shares”.  Alibaba will seek shareholders’ approval for the stock split at its annual general meeting on July 15. ","17.06.2019"
"Citi’s European chief signals confidence in London after Brexit","Timezone and rule of law are big advantages for UK capital, says bank’s regional head","The new head of Citigroup in Europe said he was confident that the City of London would retain its status as the region’s top financial centre regardless of the outcome of Brexit.  David Livingstone, who in February took over as chief executive of the bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said that London would continue to benefit from its “unique timezone [and] the rule of law”, as well as “huge support mechanisms” such as an abundance of professional services firms.  “All these things . . . contribute to what makes a vibrant financial capital, and London isn’t going to lose any of that,” Mr Livingstone said in an interview with the Financial Times.  Mr Livingstone’s comments come as Boris Johnson’s plan to take the UK out of the EU by October 31 was dealt a blow by MPs at the weekend, when they backed an amendment that forced the prime minister to request a Brexit extension until January 31.  Citi has been the most bullish of all international banks on London’s future as a financial centre. It bought its £1bn Canary Wharf skyscraper earlier this year, in contrast to rivals such as Goldman Sachs and UBS, which have decided to lease rather than own their new London HQs. Mr Livingstone said that the bank’s purchase of its European headquarters was “not only a sensible financial decision” but also “represented a positive statement about our confidence in London”. However, he said that, over time, it was inevitable that banks’ eurozone entities would end up shouldering a greater burden of financing and trading, which would cut into London’s dominance without overtaking it.  “There is a degree of EU sovereignty about this . . . they want the euro market to be located within the eurozone,” Mr Livingstone said. “So, sure, there’ll be business which leaves London, but I don’t think London fundamentally changes as the regional financial centre.” Mr Livingstone dismissed the idea that the UK would go into a recession after Brexit, insisting that any devaluation in the pound would make exports more competitive and encourage foreign investment.  He also played down the impact of Brexit on Citi, arguing that while the bank would incur additional costs in Europe because of a “degree of duplication” these would be “manageable” and did not represent a “material item dilutive to overall returns”.  Citi is well placed for Brexit compared to many peers, as it already operates a network of licensed subsidiaries and branches in Ireland and on the continent.  However, Brexit has cost the bank more than $100m so far. The US lender is creating as many as 200 new positions across its three main hubs in Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris, where it is looking for a bigger office after traders lobbied to move there rather than Germany.  It is relocating about 60 people from London and hiring locally for the remainder, but the UK will remain by far its largest international hub, with roughly 9,000 employees. Citi’s approach has differed to Bank of America, which has spent $400m shifting hundreds of staff to its European headquarters in Dublin and creating a new 500-strong trading business in Paris. BofA executives have said there is no going back to London, whatever the Brexit outcome, warning that the “bridge has been pulled up”.
 Cambridge-educated Mr Livingstone, 56, joined Citi as head of his native Australia and New Zealand from Credit Suisse in 2016, where he was vice-chairman of European investment banking.  He has spent most of his career moving between the two regions, getting his first big job as head of Asia-Pacific M&A for Goldman Sachs in the late 1990s before jumping to HSBC for a time. In recent years, Citi has been criticised by some investors, including activist ValueAct, for not acting decisively enough to streamline and focus its business lines and geographical footprint. Performance has lagged behind domestic rivals such as JPMorgan and BofA, which have both increased far more in value since the financial crisis and generate higher returns. “I would rebut the presumption that there’s a lack of focus in our strategy,” Mr Livingstone said. “It is of enormous value to a huge number of multinational companies, sovereigns and investors that . . . we can take them to 99 countries and territories around the world.” Additional reporting by Robert Armstrong in New York

"Pictet overhauls its Asia leadership in expansion drive","Swiss wealth manager is adding bankers in a growth region","Pictet, the Swiss wealth manager, is overhauling its leadership in Asia as it pushes ahead with plans to expand across the region and in the Middle East. The 214-year-old Geneva-based group has appointed Tee Fong-Seng as chief executive of its Asian wealth management business and Alex Ng as chief executive of Hong Kong and of wealth management in north Asia.  Mr Tee will join Pictet from Zurich-based private bank EFG, where he was the chairman of its Asia advisory board. Mr Ng was previously Credit Suisse’s market head for China. The leadership changes in Asia follow Pictet’s appointment of Boris Collardi as a partner and co-head of global wealth in late 2017. Mr Collardi was poached from rival Julius Baer, where he was chief executive. Pictet told the Financial Times earlier this year that it would focus on expanding in Switzerland, the Middle East and Asia starting in 2019, but also played down any idea it was seeking to challenge Julius Baer in Asia, where it is the largest pure-play private bank with more than double Pictet’s $35bn in assets under management in the region. Mr Collardi said in a statement on Monday that the new appointments would “set the stage for the next phase of growth in the region”. As growth slows in Europe and the Americas, western wealth managers and private banks have looked to Asia as a new source of revenues. Inbound investments from other regions have faced strong local competition from banks such as OCBC’s Bank of Singapore and growing Chinese rivals such as Bank of China (Hong Kong). After several years of uninterrupted growth in assets under management (AUM) in Asia, private banks faced the first contraction in growth in 2018, with AUM at the 20 largest institutions falling 3.6 per cent to $1.63tn, according to industry monitor Asian Private Banker.  Pictet was the 13th-largest wealth manager in Asia in 2018 based on AUM, although those assets shrank by about 2 per cent from the year before, according to Asian Private Banker data. The group, a partnership controlled by eight people, had $503bn in total AUM at the end of 2018. * This article has been amended since original publication to correct Bank of Singapore’s parent organisation and to remove incorrect data on the number of staff hired by Pictet

"WeWork’s S-1: some quick observations","Sorry, but this is too much.","OK, we should probably hold fire until we’ve had a think. But here are a few more interesting titbits from WeWork’s S-1 filing, spotted by ex-Alphavillain Joseph Cotterill. First, under the “Charitable Giving” section on page 199. For context, Adam Neumann is WeWork’s founder and Rebekah is his wife [with our emphasis]: In connection with this offering, Rebekah and Adam are dedicating additional resources to amplify the positive global impact of our organisation. This effort is designed to enable us to scale our social and global impact as the Company grows. Rebekah and Adam Neumann have pledged $1 billion to fund charitable causes. To fulfil this pledge, Rebekah and Adam will contribute cash and equity to charitable causes within the 10 years following this offering. Their first contribution aids in the conservation of over 20 million acres of intact tropical forest, including the region pictured on the final page of this prospectus.To evidence their commitment to charitable causes and to ensure this commitment is meaningful, if Adam and Rebekah have not contributed at least $1 billion to charitable causes as of the ten-year anniversary of the closing date of this offering, holders of all of the Company’s high-vote stock will only be entitled to ten votes per share instead of twenty votes per share. Charity, like WeWork’s corporate structure, also comes with some obvious tax benefits. Still, that’s quite the incentive.  Second, WeWork’s much-discussed transactions with Neumann’s own real estate holdings (page 200): We are party to lease agreements for four commercial properties with landlord entities in which Adam has an ownership interest. These leases, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our operations and represent only four of our 528 locations as of June 1, 2019. For one of these four properties, we entered into a lease agreement with the landlord/partnership entity within one year following Adam acquiring his ownership interest, and in the other three cases we entered into a lease agreement with the landlord/partnership entity on the same day that Adam acquired his ownership interest. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we made cash payments totalling $3.1 million, $5.6 million and $8.0 million to the landlord/partnership entities under these leases. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received payments from the landlord/partnership entities in the form of tenant improvement reimbursements of $11.6 million related to these leases. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we made cash payments to the landlord/partnership entities totalling $4.2 million under these leases and received no tenant improvement reimbursements related to these leases. As of June 30, 2019, future undiscounted minimum lease payments under these leases were approximately $236.6 million, which represents 0.5% of the Company’s total lease commitments as of June 30, 2019. Then there’s Neumann’s rather substantial credit line against his shareholding (page 201): Adam currently has a line of credit of up to $500 million with UBS AG, Stamford Branch, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, of which approximately $380 million principal amount was outstanding as of July 31, 2019. The line of credit is secured by a pledge of approximately [blank] shares of our Class B common stock beneficially owned by Adam. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has made loans and extended credit to Adam totalling $97.5 million across a variety of lending products, including mortgages secured by personal property. None of these other lending products are secured by a pledge of any of Adam’s shares of capital stock in the Company. And, to conclude, WeWork likes to keep it in the family (page 201 again):  One of Adam’s immediate family members hosted eight events relating to our Creator Awards ceremonies in 2018, for which she was paid an aggregate of less than $200,000. Another one of Adam’s immediate family members has been employed as head of the Company’s wellness offering since 2017, and he receives less than $200,000 per year for acting in this capacity. Head of Wellness? Sounds like a tough gig.

"Stocks to watch: Morrisons, LSE, Lloyds, Babcock, Hurricane","Time to check out of Europe’s hotel operators, says JPMorgan","Thursday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Wm Morrison led the FTSE 100 gainers after proposing an unexpected 2p special dividend. Interim results from the grocer matched expectations, with second-quarter retail like-for-like sales down 2.4 per cent but operating margins improving slightly. Management left full-year guidance unchanged. The margin improvement in “challenging industry conditions highlights the considerable self-help available,” said Jefferies. “Investor sentiment towards UK domestic names remains highly volatile. But the strength of delivery by Morrisons should help make the case for the group’s investment attractions.” ● Babcock gained after the UK’s Ministry of Defence named it as preferred bidder to build five frigates at its Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. The contract would run from 2020 to 2028 and had a total value of £1.25bn. “On the positive side, today’s news is a helpful win; the shares look cheap on a historic dividend yield of 5.6 per cent and management committed at the Capital Markets Day to a sustainable and progressive dividend policy. However, our concern is that the pattern of earnings downgrades of recent years may be sustained, which could eventually place pressure on the dividend, and also that UK political uncertainty probably increases further over the next six months and therefore more decisions could be delayed or cancelled, which could impact the 55 per cent of [Babcock’s] revenues which are UK public-sector related.”Panmure Gordon ● Hurricane Energy rose after the oil explorer gave a promising update from its Lincoln Crestal appraisal well within the Greater Warwick Area west of Shetland, a 50-50 joint venture with Spirit Energy. The well achieved a maximum stable flow rate of 9,800 barrels a day, suggesting it could be commercially viable, Hurricane said. Analysts saw the drill result as going some way to de-risking the 600m barrel Greater Warwick Area field. Berenberg said: “Pressure drop and water ingress are the two main risks for fractured basement developments, which require 6-12 months of continuous production before the operator can form a better understanding of the geology and well productivity. Encouragingly, production at Lancaster is now in its fourth month, with no water encountered so far.” Sellside stories ● Redburn Partners upgraded London Stock Exchange from “hold” to “buy”. The move was based on optimism about the LSE’s planned purchase of US data business Refinitiv rather than Wednesday’s takeover approach from Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which the broker said was unlikely to overcome political and regulatory concerns.  “Our view is [that] substantially greater long-term value lies in the Refinitiv deal than in the proposed HKEX bid,” Redburn told clients. “The combined entity offers strong gearing to two of the most powerful structural trends in capital markets — electronification of trading and demand for data. The headline [valuation] multiple of LSE looks elevated, but will fall rapidly as enormous EPS accretion materialises. HKEX’s approach underscores the value embedded within LSE Group; however, we see significant uncertainties attached to this bid.”Redburn About three-quarters of Refinitiv revenue comes from the creation, aggregation and global distribution of financial information, a market that has been growing at twice the pace of the wider capital markets industry since 2010 at about 4.5 per cent a year, said Redburn. Strategic mis-steps and pressure on sellside budgets have held back Refinitiv’s recent performance and margins have plenty of room to expand under more focused, aggressive stewardship, it said.  ● JPMorgan Cazenove put “underweight” ratings on InterContinental Hotels, Accor and Whitbread as part of a European lodging sector review. It had no previous rating on Whitbread and had rated InterContinental and Accor “neutral” and “overweight” respectively. A lack of momentum in the first half raises the risk that second-half results and 2020 outlooks would disappoint against overly bullish market expectations, JPMorgan said. Share prices had been resilient in spite of a string of downgrades and valuations were rich at 20 times forward earnings, the broker said. The uncertain macro outlook combined with high valuations, with no major positive company-specific catalysts on the horizon, would translate to weak investor appetite and short interest, JPMorgan said. Its data suggested hotel occupancy was already at peak levels and revenue per available room, the industry’s key metric, now relies entirely on price rises. “We believe that sooner rather than later, the market will incorporate end-of-cycle concerns into valuations and forecasts within the peer group,” it said.  During the last great recession of 2007 to 2010, earnings per share halved on average and investors started pricing in the end of the cycle about seven to 10 months in advance, JPMorgan said. InterContinental fell the most during the last recession even though its margins proved relatively resilient and it was the only hotelier to maintain its dividend. “Hence we question the defensiveness attribute typically attached to this name, particularly at current valuation multiples,” said JPMorgan. Post Whitbread’s Costa disposal the market would increasingly focus on a material deterioration in the UK outlook since the beginning of the year, JPMorgan added. “As a pure UK domestic business, Whitbread is also the most exposed hotelier to the current economic and political UK turmoil.” ● Goldman Sachs downgraded Lloyds Banking Group from “neutral” to “sell” with a 47p target as part of a UK bank sector review. It cited rising macro risks, and a flattening of the sterling yield curve, as well as intensifying competition for mortgage lending from HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland.  “We see Lloyds as a well-run bank with management, in our view, pursing the right strategy . . . A key question for the group going forward, however, will be how long it can maintain the higher yield of its mortgage book. Ultimately, over the medium term, we believe that the yield of its mortgage book will fall toward an industry-average level, driving downward revisions to consensus forecasts.Goldman The flattening of the yield curve may erode about half of Lloyds’ “structural hedge contribution” by 2022, said Goldman. Unlike most of its peers, Lloyds used an active loan-hedging strategy that provided 8 per cent of the bank’s annualised net interest income, down from 15 per cent in 2017, it said. “With swap rates having fallen significantly and the yield curve now flat to slightly inverted, this has important ramifications for Lloyds. First, for the banks in general, as existing hedges from prior years with higher rates mature and are either rolled forward at spot rates or rolled off, the net contribution of the structural hedge to NII will diminish. Secondly, the flat yield curve means that simply increasing the notional or duration of the hedge would no longer result in an uplift of NII, all else equal.”Goldman Goldman also turned negative on Bank of Ireland and added AIB Group, the Allied Irish Banks owner, to its “buy” list.  ● In brief: 4 Imprint raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Ascential rated new “hold” at Liberum; Beiersdorf cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Close Brothers cut to “hold” at Investec; DNB raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Eurofins Scientific rated new “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Euromoney rated new “hold” at Berenberg; Evotec raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Future rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Genmab raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; IQE cut to “speculative buy” at Canaccord; James Fisher raised to “hold” at Canaccord; Jungheinrich rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Norsk Hydro rated new “underweight” at Barclays; Zurich Insurance raised to “buy” at Société Générale.

"SFO case against ex-Barclays bankers is ‘misconceived’, court told","Roger Jenkins would have been ‘insane’ to risk his job in sham with Qatar PM, defence argues","Roger Jenkins, a former top banker at Barclays and the “gatekeeper” of the bank’s relationship with Qatar, would have been “insane” to risk his job and £50m in compensation by suggesting a sham with the Gulf state’s prime minister, a jury has heard in a high-profile fraud trial. The case brought by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office against Mr Jenkins and two other senior bankers, is “misconceived”, the jury at London’s Old Bailey heard on Thursday, as defence teams began presenting their arguments for the first time. The SFO alleges that Mr Jenkins, with Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, lied to the market in 2008 when they negotiated secret side deals with Qatar as the Gulf state injected about £4bn into Barclays across two emergency fundraisings that helped keep the bank from a UK government bailout at the height of the financial crisis. The SFO’s case is that the so-called advisory services agreements, ASAs, which it says were not properly disclosed to the market, were a “dishonest mechanism” to funnel the Qataris £322m in extra fees they demanded in exchange for investing.  Chris Lucas, the bank’s finance director at the time and an alleged co-conspirator of the trio, was “at the centre of the scheme to provide the Qataris with their fee for investing”, Ed Brown, QC for the SFO, said on Thursday. Mr Lucas was not charged as he is too ill to stand trial. John Kelsey-Fry, QC for Mr Jenkins, who was dubbed “Big Dog” at Barclays, said that lengthy opening arguments by the SFO were yet to show any evidence that the side deals were shams. He described how Mr Jenkins, who will give evidence later, had wooed for months Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, then the prime minister of Qatar, which had outsize natural gas profits that it sought to invest through its powerful sovereign wealth fund.  Mr Jenkins had tried to lure Qatar from its bank of 20 years, Credit Suisse. The court has heard that Barclays’ chief executive in 2008, John Varley, described the Qataris as the “new cocks of the roost”. Mr Kelsey-Fry, and Ian Winter, QC for Mr Kalaris, argued that Barclays was getting genuine services from Qatar, potentially worth billions of pounds, by striking the side deals, and that the ASAs had been sanctioned by the bank’s lawyers. “The prosecution has been conspicuously silent on how Mr Jenkins, presented with the opportunity to seek a genuine ASA to the plain advantage of both Barclays and to the advantage of Qatar, nevertheless chose to present a false, fraudulent one, with all the obvious attendant disadvantages and pitfalls in so doing,” Mr Kelsey-Fry told the jury. “Why? Short of insanity, why?” Mr Jenkins was paid £39m in 2007 and got recommended a £25m bonus for striking the two deals with Qatar. Mr Brown previously said this showed Mr Jenkins and his co-defendants were desperate to keep their jobs. “We respectfully agree,” said Mr Kelsey-Fry, adding that evidence from the bank’s ex-chairman, Marcus Agius, would detail that bankers needed to be paid like footballers.  Mr Kelsey-Fry said suggesting a fraudulent scam to Sheikh Hamad, when a real arrangement existed, could have cost Mr Jenkins his job, and “good leaver” status that brought with it £50m.  The jury has heard tapes of phone calls between Mr Kalaris and Mr Boath in which they joked about going to jail, and the fear that they might be “rumbled”. Mr Winter told the jury that the prosecution had contrived a “perverse” reading of these conversations, which actually demonstrated the pair were concerned that the ASAs should be legitimate, and needed the sign-off of lawyers.  They also showed Mr Kalaris thought there was a proper, commercial reason for entering into a strategic relationship with Qatar, he said. “When you read these conversations, they not only destroy the prosecution allegations, they make the defence case for us,” Mr Winter told the jury. The trial continues. Mr Boath’s legal team will present arguments on Friday.  The defendants deny the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.","17.10.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Celgene, Next, Apple suppliers, Vectura, Asos","French protests leave staffing companies looking vulnerable, says Credit Suisse","Thursday 16:10 GMT What’s happening ● Bristol-Myers Squibb slumped on fears that it was overpaying for cancer drug developer Celgene. BMS announced it was buying Celgene for $74bn in cash and stock, a premium of 54 per cent based on Wednesday’s closing prices.  Celgene had dropped 39 per cent last year after pipeline failures and delays stoked concerns about its reliance on the blockbuster Revlimid treatment for myeloma and blood disorders, which provides two-thirds of group revenue and loses US patent protections next year. “This transaction dilutes investors’ exposure to Celgene’s patent cliff, relieves Celgene investors of the trials of the company’s management decision making and offers immediate upside that would otherwise take many months, or even years, to be realised. While Celgene’s shareholders are unlikely to reject the offer, Bristol’s could, hence our recommendation to sell into the liquidity associated with this announcement.”Leerink Pfizer, Novartis and Merck might all be interested in a counterbid for Celgene, given only Novartis has a major overlapping competitive product, said Jefferies. Analysts also highlighted Gilead, Biogen, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Alexion Pharmaceuticals as potential takeover targets within the beaten-down US biotechnology sector.  “The initial reaction we are getting (essentially, ‘two turkeys don’t make an eagle’) would seem to be evidenced by Bristol’s initial stock reaction  . . .  but we think this is clearly positive to the sector in that it reminds investors of upside potential in the space . . .  a key lesson here is that when large-cap biotechs find themselves under duress, more often than not the exit is a take-out.”Piper Jaffray ● Apple supply-chain companies including AMS, Dialog, STMicroelectronics, ASML and Renishaw dropped in response to its warning overnight that poor demand for iPhones in China meant December-quarter revenue would be down 5 per cent year on year.  Apple’s guidance implies it will sell around 9m fewer iPhones than investors expect, said JPMorgan Cazenove. Consensus expectations had stood at 75m units for the December quarter. “Although AMS has already issued a profit warning in November, we believe that the extent of Apple weakness could prompt further estimate cuts,” said JPMorgan. “Further, we believe that STMicroelectronics and Dialog, which have not issued any profit warning yet, will now almost certainly do so or issue very weak March-quarter guidance.” According to Credit Suisse, Apple provides around 75 per cent of Dialog’s revenue. AMS has around 40 to 45 per cent exposure to Apple and STMicro has 10 to 15 per cent exposure, it said. “For 2019, we assume iPhone units to be down low single digit in percentage terms for all the companies mentioned above. However, with a slowing iPhone replacement cycle especially in developed markets, this may continue to lead to debate around Apple’s ability to drive growth in iPhone units going forward unless helped by a significant technology shift.”Credit Suisse Apple was down 9 per cent at the US open. Jefferies downgraded to “hold” from “buy” on Apple, saying “nationalism seems to be in play, with the Chinese consumer perhaps perceiving iPhone purchasers as anti-China”. It forecast Apple to sell just 185m iPhones this year, the lowest total since 2014. “Apple’s business in China appears to be rapidly deteriorating with the revised outlook for iPhone materially worse than our below-consensus estimates. We still think Apple can build a massive Services business over time. But Apple hasn’t missed its guide in years, so the extent of this miss suggests it is navigating uncharted waters. We move to the sidelines and wait for clarity as uncertainty grows around the hardware business.”Jefferies ● Next led the UK retailers higher after kicking off the Christmas reporting season with a better than feared update.  Retail sales for the quarter were a touch ahead of expectations, falling 9.2 per cent compared with a 10 per cent consensus decline, while online sales jumped 15.2 per cent to beat forecasts of 10 per cent growth. While Next nudged its 2019 year-end profit guidance lower by less than 1 per cent to reflect a higher proportion of online sales and seasonal products diluting margins, a 19 per cent share price drop in December suggested investors had been expecting worse.  “Next’s in-line trading update, which points to solid December trading, may steady the sector after two difficult months for share prices, although predominantly store-based chains (yet to report) face stiffer headwinds.”stifel ● Vectura
, the inhaler developer, hit its best level since August after saying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for 2018 would be “materially above” consensus expectations on in-line revenue. This was thanks to “revenue mix, productivity initiatives and margin improvements”, Vectura said. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse downgraded Adecco to “underperform” and cut Randstad to “neutral” in a review of the European recruitment sector.  “Our staffing lead indicator suggests end market data will weaken further in the coming months. This will, we believe, be compounded by the impact of protests on French industrial activity. While some market weakening is captured in share prices, we think declining organic growth rates (and negative in the case of Adecco in the fourth quarter) will weigh further on share prices in the near term.”Credit Suisse On Adecco, Credit Suisse cited a combination of declining organic growth, negative operational leverage and structural headwinds within the industry, given the growing importance of digital delivery. “The strength of Adecco’s balance sheet and working capital dynamics mitigate the risk but, until either organic growth stabilises or valuation is discounting perpetually impaired earnings power, the risk is, in our view, to the downside.” ● Peel Hunt restarted coverage of Asos with a “buy” rating and £40 target price, having suspended its recommendation following last month’s profit warning from the online retailer. Its target before the warning was £82. “We believe Asos did not react strongly enough to the heavy levels of discounting in the market around Black Friday. Early indications suggest trading levels have picked up into December’s clearance activity and we may well see February’s trading update confirm sales performance is above revised full-year guidance of 15 per cent group revenue growth. As one of the leading global fashion websites, we view the current share price weakness as a rare buying opportunity.”Peel Hunt ● In brief: Games Workshop raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Hapag-Lloyd upgraded to “neutral” at UBS; Lundin Mining raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Nestlé raised to “buy” at UBS; SFS rated new “sell” at Berenberg.

"Ex-Credit Suisse bankers charged over $2bn Mozambique ‘tuna bond’ scandal","Country’s one-time finance minister also arrested in connection with indictment","Three former Credit Suisse bankers have been charged by US prosecutors with alleged fraud and receiving kickbacks in connection with Mozambique’s $2bn “tuna bonds” hidden loans scandal. Manuel Chang, Mozambique’s finance minister at the time of the loan deals, was also arrested in South Africa on Saturday in connection with the indictment.  The charges stem from a 2013 deal for Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries, to borrow from international investors ostensibly to fund maritime projects, including a state tuna fishery, ahead of investments in offshore gas. The loans were partly concealed from the International Monetary Fund and donors before they collapsed and sparked a financial crisis amid signs that the projects were suspect. The three former employees of the Swiss investment bank - Andrew Pearse, Detelina Subeva and Surjan Singh - were arrested and released on bail in London on Thursday, according to the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of New York. It said it was seeking their extradition over alleged money laundering and defrauding of US investors in the loans. Mr Chang and the bankers “created the maritime projects as fronts to enrich themselves and intentionally diverted portions of the loan proceeds” to fund $200m of bribes and kickbacks, according to the indictment. The indictment charged four counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Mr Chang was not charged on the FCPA conspiracy count. The US charges are likely to reignite a political crisis in Mozambique over the financial fallout from the hidden debts, ahead of national polls this year where President Filipe Nyusi and Frelimo, the ruling party, face a fight to retain power. The IMF and international donors cut off support for the government’s budget after the loans were discovered in 2016, triggering a slowdown for what was one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies. The scandal also imperilled investment in the offshore gasfields. Auditors later found that $500m of the money raised by the loans could not be accounted for and that the companies behind the debt paid over the odds for equipment.  Mozambique eventually defaulted on the debts, which are being restructured. Credit Suisse is advising investors in the loans. Analysts say that Mr Chang’s arrest in particular will increase tensions within Frelimo as he was close to Armando Guebuza, Mr Nyusi’s predecessor as president. Mr Chang’s South African lawyer has indicated that he would fight a US request for extradition. The former Credit Suisse bankers allegedly deceived investors over the loans’ true purpose and circumvented the bank’s internal controls to conceal the alleged fraud, according to US prosecutors. The indictment accused the bankers of using personal emails to conceal their activities and misleading the bank over the nature of the companies behind the loans. Lawyers for the three bankers in London did not immediately return emailed requests for comment late on Thursday. The US attorney’s office additionally alleged that the three former bankers acted “within the scope of their employment” and that they intended, in part at least, to benefit the bank, two key tests prosecutors have to meet to find a company liable for the actions of its employees. Credit Suisse has not been charged. A spokesperson for the bank said in a statement that the trio “worked to defeat the bank’s internal controls, acted out of a motive of personal profit, and sought to hide these activities from the bank”. “Credit Suisse will continue to co-operate with relevant regulators following these indictments, and separately looks forward to continuing to work with the relevant authorities to move forward with the proposed debt restructuring,” the bank spokesperson said. Prosecutors also charged Jean Boustani, an executive of Privinvest, an Abu Dhabi-based group that supplied boats and gear to the projects, with three counts of conspiracy. Mr Boustani was arrested in New York on Wednesday and ordered detained, according to the spokesperson for the US attorney’s office. A New York-based attorney for Mr Boustani did not immediately return a request for comment. Privinvest could not be reached for comment. Mr Pearse and Ms Subeva left Credit Suisse to work for Privinvest in 2013.  Last year the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority dropped its own criminal investigation into Credit Suisse’s conduct over the Mozambique loans.","04.01.2019"
"Lawyer in ENRC fraud case seeks £100,000 spying damages","Dechert partner sues corporate investigation firm for trespass and harassment","Corporate investigators placed camouflaged cameras on the property of a top partner at a US law firm and tried to gain access to a private Caribbean island where he was holidaying, according to a lawsuit filed in London. In the latest claim to shed light on the murky world of corporate investigations, Neil Gerrard, co-head of white collar and securities litigation at Dechert, is suing Diligence International in a London court for alleged misuse of private information, trespass, harassment and data protection breaches. He and his wife are seeking as much as £100,000 in damages from the firm, which was founded by former intelligence officers. At least two Diligence operatives have been questioned by British police in relation to Mr Gerrard’s allegations, according to the court documents. Diligence has worked on high-profile briefs such as tracing the assets of Mukhtar Ablyazov, the former Kazakh bank executive. According to Mr Gerrard’s legal claim, operatives from Diligence secretly installed a video camera system on his East Sussex property that linked up to a hide on neighbouring land, camouflaged with chicken wire and foliage. The camera recorded vehicle and passenger details entering the property, the documents allege. During a January family holiday to a private island near Saint Lucia, two Diligence operatives attempted to gain access by claiming to be Mr Gerrard’s nephews, but were denied entry by local authorities, the documents claim. A third operative then booked a last-minute room at the island’s hotel but was apprehended by authorities at the local airport and questioned. His bag contained “a large amount of electronic equipment, including a camera adjusted for night-vision use”, according to the documents. Mr Gerrard also claims that he was surveilled at a local London restaurant a few weeks later by two men, whom the restaurant manager said seemed “very interested” in Mr Gerrard, the documents claim. A call and email to Diligence’s London office were not immediately returned. A defence to Mr Gerrard’s claim has yet to be filed. Mr Gerrard’s lawyers at Enyo Law declined to comment on his claim. Mr Gerrard is locked in an acrimonious battle with ENRC, the Kazakh mining company that fell out of the FTSE 100 in 2014 amid fraud and corruption allegations. Mr Gerrard was once the lawyer brought in to lead an internal ENRC investigation into multiple allegations of wrongdoing in Kazakhstan and Africa, however, the company now accuses him of leaking information to the Serious Fraud Office and milking the miner for millions of pounds. He denies those allegations. In turn, he alleges in a lawsuit that senior managers at ENRC oversaw bribes to senior officials in Africa, flouted sanctions and overpaid during acquisitions of related companies.  ENRC is still subject to a long-running criminal investigation by the SFO, which it is also challenging through the courts. ENRC denies all the allegations against it. When questioned by police, the Diligence operatives declined to say who had instructed them to surveil Mr Gerrard. ENRC declined to comment. The claim comes as the corporate-intelligence sector has been rocked by separate scandals that have revealed some of the lengths private investigators will go to in order to fulfil their briefs. An executive in Burford Capital’s corporate-intelligence and asset-tracing division has been accused of unlawfully trading confidential documents for a sex tape while working for a shipping client. Separately, Credit Suisse has been hit by a spying scandal after the bank hired investigators to tail an executive and a middleman involved in the case appeared to have died by suicide. Zurich’s public prosecutor is investigating both the death and whether any criminal offences were committed.

"Denmark’s Jyske Bank imposes negative interest rates","Customers with balances over DKr7.5m will have to pay a default rate of 0.6 per cent a year","Jyske Bank has become the first Danish lender to impose negative interest rates on customer deposits and has warned that sub-zero rates were looking “rather permanent”.  Denmark’s third-largest lender said on Tuesday that customers with balances over DKr7.5m ($1.1m) would be charged a default rate of 0.6 per cent a year.  Chief executive Anders Dam said the bank was making the change because it had “a significant and increasing deposit surplus from personal clients and hence incurs large expenses in relation to these”. Apart from four months in 2014, Denmark’s central bank has had sub-zero interest rates since 2012, longer than any other country.  Danish banks have responded by offering negative interest rates on mortgages since 2015, while Jyske last week became the first to offer a sub-zero 10-year home loan, in effect paying customers 0.5 per cent to borrow.  Lenders had been wary of imposing negative rates on other retail customers, arguing it could lead to cash hoarding. But Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse led the way this summer, announcing plans for negative rates for their wealthiest clients.  Mr Dam said Jyske had been hard hit by negative rates. The bank’s net interest income fell 6 per cent in the first half compared with a year earlier, despite a rise in volume. “The negative interest rate environment that has affected the Danish market since the spring of 2012 . . . now seems to be of a rather permanent nature,” he added, noting that all Danish government debt had negative yields while the market expected negative rates to last for several years.  Other smaller Danish banks have hinted that they could impose negative rates on customers. “We’ve got a problem,” Lars Petersson, chief executive of Sparekassen Sjaellend-Fyn bank, told Danish website FinansWatch. But Denmark’s largest lender, Danske Bank, reiterated recently that it had no plans to do so.  Regulators are watching closely to see how customers react and whether it leads to significant withdrawals or account switching.  The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority is also monitoring whether banks are giving bad advice by pushing customers into investment products with high fees in an attempt to avoid negative rates. It made the warning after Danske conceded in June that it had overcharged customers in one product, a move that led to the firing of Jesper Nielsen, who had been named as the bank’s interim chief executive following a huge money-laundering scandal.","20.08.2019"
"Marty Chavez, once seen as CEO candidate, to leave Goldman Sachs","Securities division co-head pushed technological change over 19-year career at the bank","The co-head of Goldman Sachs’ securities division Marty Chavez — once seen as a contender for the chief executive’s chair — is leaving the firm, chief executive David Solomon told employees on Tuesday.  Mr Chavez has spent 19 years at Goldman, including a stint as chief financial officer that ended last year when Mr Solomon rejigged the management team he inherited from former chief executive Lloyd Blankfein.  Mr Chavez, 55, will be replaced by Marc Nachmann, a London-based, 25-year veteran of the firm who was previously co-head of Goldman’s global investment banking division.  Mr Nachmann, 49, will move to New York, closer to his family in Florida, from where he has been commuting weekly to London. He will not be replaced, cutting the number of co-heads of investment banking to two: Gregg Lemkau and Dan Dees. The reshuffle comes four months before a long-awaited investor day at which Mr Solomon has promised to reveal further details of a pivot from Goldman’s investment banking and trading roots towards consumer banking and serving smaller companies.  “It helps to make sure we know who’s going to be around for the next few years,” a person familiar with the matter said of the timing of Mr Chavez’s departure, adding that Mr Nachmann’s long service in Goldman’s corporate finance division would be an asset to the securities unit as it tries to become more “client focused”.  Mr Chavez’s most recent role placed him at the heart of the digital transformation of Goldman’s trading arm, a key area of focus for Mr Solomon and his team. Trading revenues at Goldman have fallen more sharply in recent years than at its rivals.  The retirement — Goldman’s preferred term for departing partners — was announced in a memo signed by Mr Solomon, Goldman’s president John Waldron and chief financial officer Stephen Scherr.  The trio said Mr Chavez would step down at the end of the year and become a senior director of the bank, a non-board title used for management committee members who retain a relationship with the firm. That gives him closer ties to the firm than other senior executives who have left under the Solomon regime, including former trading co-heads Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet, who left after Mr Solomon’s appointment was announced. Mr Chavez had a varied career across several stints at Goldman, having joined in 1993 as a senior energy strategist in the commodities division. He moved to Credit Suisse in 1997 and then co-founded energy trading software company Kiodex, before rejoining Goldman in 2005.  “He has been a passionate advocate for engineers throughout the firm, redefining our clients’ experience with software and data,” Mr Solomon wrote, adding that Goldman “has also benefited greatly from Marty’s cross-divisional experience and his deep insight into regulatory reform, market structure and operational infrastructure”. Mr Solomon also praised Mr Chavez, who is gay, for being a “dedicated and passionate leader” who promoted LGBT+ inclusion both in and outside the workplace. ","03.09.2019"
"S&P 500 back in record territory","Strong rotation into beaten-up ‘value’ stocks drives benchmark towards new peak","The S&P 500 was back in record territory, as a tentative deal in the US-China trade war, and a months-long sell-off in bonds, have lifted investor confidence and spurred a rally in cheap, beaten-up stocks. The equities benchmark was up 0.5 per cent Friday, giving it a shot at finishing above its incumbent record high close of 3,025.86 on July 26. At its high today of 3,027.39, the index was about 0.6 points away from its intraday record from that same session. That brings the S&P 500’s advance for the year to 20.7 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite sits about 1 per cent from its peak close of three months ago, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 1.3 per cent from its July 15 record. Boosting the market late in the morning session on Friday were comments from the office of US trade representative Robert Lighthizer the US and China were “close to finalising some sections” of an interim trade agreement. Growing concerns over the summer that Washington and Beijing were struggling to agree a deal on trade, thereby extending its dampening effect on the economy, and signals from the Treasury market flagging strong warnings about a possible US recession, had investors piling into haven assets like government bonds, gold and bolt-hole currencies. Most notably, and against the backdrop of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in July for the first time since the financial crisis, yields on US Treasuries tumbled to multiyear lows. The yield on longer-term Treasuries fell below those of shorter-term notes, an inversion of the so-called yield curve that is regarded by the market as a possible predictor of an impending economic recession. The UK’s exit from the EU remains a concern for investors. Although members of British parliament this week voted in favour of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, they did not back his plan for the UK to leave on October 31, reinjecting some uncertainty into the process. While concerns of a brewing economic slowdown saw investors spurn equities as a whole, some segments of the asset class fared worse than others. Small-caps, regarded as more exposed to the domestic economy, underperformed large-caps, while defensive stocks and those that offered relatively higher dividend yields were in vogue and became expensive. The divergences between some equities segments was stretched to historical extremes. The valuation of the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 fell to its lowest relative to large-cap equities since June 2003, according to Jefferies. Analysts at JPMorgan said their momentum indicator for the S&P 500 reached a maximal positive reading and that for small-caps reached its maximal reading, with such an extreme divergence occurring on only two days in history. In late August, that all snapped back. Treasuries began selling off, sending yields higher. The yield curve has since turned positive after the Federal Reserve, despite cutting rates again in September, forecast no further easing this year. That saw investors pile back into small-caps and so-called value stocks in a big way. Momentum stocks — those that found favour over summer and had the best recent record — have been dumped. With this rotation now in tow, value names have outperformed growth stocks by some way so far this month. An iShares exchange traded fund tracking value names in the S&P 500 has gained 5.8 per cent since the end of August, roundly beating an ETF tracking the benchmark’s growth stocks, which is up less than one-tenth of 1 per cent. The proliferation of growth stocks, which are often tech companies, in the Nasdaq Composite is one possible reason why that index has yet to recapture its July peak, and sits 1.1 per cent shy of its record close. Equities investors are also in the midst of earnings season, with 48 per cent of the S&P 500 by market cap having reported quarterly results as of October 24. So far, “Earnings are beating by 4.8 per cent, with 73 per cent of companies exceeding their bottom-line estimates,” Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub said in a note. All up, quarterly EPS growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to be down 0.8 per cent from a year ago, said Mr Golub, but is on pace for 1.1 per cent growth assuming a “typical beat rate” for the remainder of reporting season, he added.","25.10.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Faurecia, Tesco, IQE, Whitbread, Hugo Boss, XXL","BMW’s new chief can drive a turnround, says Morgan Stanley","Tuesday 15:00 BST What’s happening ● Faurecia
 led Europe’s auto parts makers higher after better than expected earnings from the French interiors and emission control systems maker. Forecast-beating margins offset slightly weaker than hoped revenue, which held steady year on year at €8.97bn. The company reiterated full-year 2019 earnings and cash flow guidance as well as sticking with a target to outperform a shrinking total market. “The overall perception of Faurecia has progressively improved over the last five years, thanks to higher-than-expected organic growth, sustained higher returns, a refocused business and stronger balance sheet,” said Kepler Cheuvreux. “These results make the full-year 2019 guidance — logically confirmed — more credible and should support a relative re-rating of the shares.” ● Tesco and J Sainsbury were the worst performers among the UK supermarkets after industry data suggested a tough month for the sector.  A Kantar Worldpanel report showed total industry cash sales down 0.7 per cent in the four weeks to mid July. The big-four grocers averaged a 2.9 per cent decline and all lost market share, with Tesco and Sainsbury the laggards showing cash sales down 3 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. The higher end of the industry was equally tough with Marks and Spencer food sales down 3.8 per cent. ● IQE was headed for its biggest daily gain in two years after the chip materials maker was certified to supply a major customer in Asia using supply chains that bypass Chinese trade restrictions. Initial production for the customer had commenced from a Taiwan foundry and a second Asian company was looking to place orders, said the company, which also revealed a contract win in Singapore. “Collectively, these deals demonstrate IQE’s ability to jump on the newly emerging (in response to trade-war) Asia-centric supply chains . . . With the semiconductor bellwether TSMC flagging the bottoming of the market . . . and pressure on the US administration from companies like Google to solve the Huawei issue in a timely manner . . . we see no reason why IQE’s shares should continue to underperform its peer group.”Peel Hunt Sellside stories ● Bernstein Research downgraded Whitbread, the Premier Inn owner, to “underperform” from “market perform” with a £42 target price.  A valuation of 19 times earnings was “too high a multiple for an asset-heavy UK hotel operator which is losing market share and suffering from ongoing cyclical (Brexit) and structural (saturation of UK market) risks,” Bernstein said.  The near 50 per cent rally for Whitbread shares over the past eight months has been on declining fundamentals, with total accommodation sales deteriorating in the first quarter and management optimism looking unfounded, said Bernstein. “We forecast three years of negative free cash flow as margins stay constrained and the company continues to fund growth in the UK and Germany. These weak fundamentals should now drive the stock,” it said. Merrill Lynch also set a £42 target price on Whitbread and downgraded it to “underperform” from “neutral.” ● Morgan Stanley upgraded BMW to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a €75 target in response to the appointment last week of Oliver Zipse as the car maker’s new chief executive. “Although Mr Zipse faces the same challenges as before, we believe 1. any strategic changes and restructuring would be well received; 2. auto data likely improves from here; 3. valuation and sentiment seem extreme.”Morgan Stanley BMW has “a clear requirement for costs to be cut sharply, and for investment spending to be managed strategically to match the assets and free cash flow available,” said Morgan Stanley. New management has options to accelerate the plan to cut total spending by €12bn, such as by retiring production of low-margin models and engines, the broker said. And, though Chinese growth will probably slow in the current half, sales momentum should be enough to sustain margins. “At current expectations, we think this could be enough to support the shares.” ● In brief: Akzo Nobel cut to “sell” at Citigroup; Colefax cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; DSV cut to “hold” at Stifel; Engie raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; HelloFresh rated new “outperform” at Macquarie; Hugo Boss raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Julius Baer cut to “sell” at Société Générale; Lufthansa cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; National Grid raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Novartis cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Orsted cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Persimmon raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Ryanair cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Salini Impregilo raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Smith & Nephew raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Storytel rated new “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Suez cut to “sell” at Deutsche Bank; Talanx cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Unite raised to “hold” at Stifel; United Utilities raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; XPS Pensions rated new “outperform” at RBC; XXL cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.

"The younger generation needs better advice on impact investing","Every wealth manager says how stressful it is for the children of rich people to inherit money","Every wealth manager I meet will almost always, at some point in the conversation, tell me how stressful it is for the children of rich people to inherit money. This so-called Next Gen, as they are termed in private banking circles, feels under incredible pressure from their parents to prove themselves individually, they say. Especially as the parents are these days likely to have been highly successful entrepreneurs who made their own money. Their offspring feel at pains to show the world they are not the old-fashioned trust fund kids who simply spend their parents’ money on parties, designer clothes or drugs. I nod and look sympathetic. But it is hard to suppress an eye roll. The stress of inheriting money feels low on the list of the world’s problems. A recent Credit Suisse report quotes its global wealth management boss Iqbal Khan as saying: “The Next Generation are sometimes misconstrued as a group of privileged individuals lacking ambition. Based on my own experience, this is far from the truth.” Ambition, perhaps. But certainly not privilege.  Part of this earnest sympathy from wealth managers is that they are trying to show they are on rich kids’ wavelength. They get it. In fact, they know there is a business case there. Firms face increased pressure to demonstrate value to younger generations, a report by consultancy EY has found, while warning how often the Next Gen change their adviser. It is not just about a sympathetic ear. Wealth advisers are also trying to stay relevant by offering products they think will appeal to younger people. Impact investing is the obvious one. Millennials (and others) are said to be increasingly keen to use their money and influence to invest more thoughtfully, in projects that can effect social or environmental change. The problem is that the next generation aren’t the experts in impact investment that wealth managers might have us believe. While 64 per cent of the younger generation Credit Suisse surveyed were interested in impact investing, only 24 per cent had actually invested. And sustainable and impact investment ranked as the worst asset class in terms of both those who felt their knowledge of it was poor — more than 50 per cent — and those who felt their knowledge was excellent — just 8 per cent. At least the 8 per cent are trying to swell their ranks. I recently chatted with Abigail Noble, chief executive of The ImPact, a member network that aims to educate people about impact investing and whose co-founders include members of the Rockefeller and Pritzker families. She says things have changed a lot at wealth managers in recent years — almost all now have a head of impact or sustainable investment. But the issue is whether these people can get past the wealth advisers. “There’s a strong culture of gatekeeping your clients, swimming within the lane, and presenting certain products according to what you’re comfortable with and compliant,” she says.  But if younger generations unify their voices and explain that impact is important to them, she argues, then the banks will have to change. Turning stress about inheritance into impactful investment is something I can get behind.  Alice Ross is the editor of FT Wealth magazine and Financial Times Wealth Correspondent

"Stocks to watch: Indivior, Hurricane Energy, Cobham, Natixis, BAT","Umicore will struggle after Chinese electric car sales stall, says UBS","Thursday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Reckitt Benckiser edged higher after it reached a deal with the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to exclude it from an investigation into alleged mis-selling of Suboxone film, an opiate addiction treatment, by its demerged business Indivior. Reckitt agreed to pay up to $1.5bn to free itself from all investigations in connection with the Indivior indictment and related claims, without admitting any wrongdoing. “We think that the quick settlement is good news, as it provides clarity and protects RB’s US business from lengthy legal struggles,” said Kepler Cheuvreux.  ● Indivior itself surged after reporting that sales of Suboxone film had held up in spite of generic competition entering the market in February. The group’s sales target for the full year rose to between $670m and $720m, from $525m to $575m previously, with net income expected at $80m to $130m against previous guidance for a $40m loss to a $10m profit. “While the Reckitt case is completely separate to Indivior’s, it does indicate that a settlement, without admission of wrongdoing and the consequent implications, can be reached with the DoJ. Indivior continues to be willing to fight the DoJ in court, but is also in parallel talking to the US Department of Health and Human Services to find a way to avoid being excluded from government contracts. The DoJ court case is due to start in May 2020. While there remains significant uncertainty about the eventual outcome of litigation with DoJ, we believe this is fully reflected in the share price.”Stifel ● Hurricane Energy rose on the back of an operating update from the North Sea oil explorer, which was hosting a capital markets day. The company said its Lancaster field was performing either in line or slightly ahead of initial expectations so raised its 2020 production guidance from 17,000 barrels per day to a range of 17,000 to 20,000b/d. Current-year targets were left unchanged and news on drilling was limited to detail on the recent failure of its Warwick Deep well. “Today’s announcement from Hurricane is yet another step forward in demonstrating the deliverability of the fractured basement play in the UK North Sea on the Lancaster licence. We continue to anticipate that 6-12 months of production data is required in order to fully understand the scale of the reservoir and sustainability of production, however this update and increase to 2020 guidance is very encouraging for investors.”RBC Sellside stories ● Piper Jaffray downgraded British American Tobacco to “neutral” from “overweight” with a £31 target. Competing with Juul and IQOS, Philip Morris International’s ecigarette brand, “looks daunting”, it said. “IQOS and Juul stand out as the two reduced-risk products with the most significant traction with consumers, with Juul reaching $4bn in annualised US retail sales and IQOS posting over $7bn of revenues in 2018. IQOS is now set to launch in the US, where BAT’s cigarette declines are already accelerating. The US is BAT’s highest margin segment, and its highest margin US brands appear to have the most acute market share pressure.”Piper Jaffray The broker cut earnings forecasts for BAT to reflect Brexit uncertainty as well as the weaker US outlook. The broker added that it was not ready to assume much success for Velo, BAT’s nicotine-free oral tobacco pouch aimed at the same market as Swedish Match’s Zyn.  BAT’s valuation has increased as the outlook dimmed, Piper Jaffray added. It said a 24 per cent gain since late January has valued the stock at just over 9 times 2019 earnings, up from 8 times at the start of the year.  ● Barclays upgraded Cobham, the aerospace and defence engineer, to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a 135p target.  A Financial Conduct Authority investigation, a long-running tax dispute
 and a dispute with Boeing over refuelling equipment have all been resolved, with costs factored into consensus estimates, Barclays said. With Cobham emerging as “a cleaner execution equity story” for driving earnings and free cash flow growth “absent of material risk and cash overhang”, the shares can reclaim their historic 25 per cent premium to the sector, it said.  ● Goldman Sachs upgraded Natixis to “buy” from “neutral” with a €5.40 target price. It said the French bank had “an effective model that should keep delivering” and argued that the recent scrutiny of H20 Asset Management, its best performing subsidiary, “should not threaten the model as a whole”. Natixis has over the past 10 years delivered a 21 per cent total shareholder return per annum compared with 1.4 per cent for the wider banking sector, said Goldman. It said the outperformance was thanks to Natixis’s capital-light business mix, with no direct negative exposure to lower interest rates and no retail deposit gathering operations, as well as its superior returns from tight management of risk-weighted assets. Backing from parent bank BPCE has also meant Natixis dodges stress tests and has less need to hoard capital, so can return more to shareholders, Goldman said.  In spite of the outflows and reputational damage linked to H20’s problems, Natixis should be able to continue delivering higher-than-average returns, Goldman said. It highlighted that the bank had controlling stakes in more than 20 independent asset managers promising returns a “monolithic management company” would struggle to achieve. While the multi-manager strategy means assets under management are more volatile, it has proven successful with Natixis’s revenue growth matching peers and its fee rates edging higher, Goldman said.  A continued move away from capital-heavy businesses and low sensitivity to interest rates should also be positive for Natixis returns over the next few years, Goldman said. It said the stock was trading 27 per cent below its five-year valuation average. ● UBS downgraded Umicore, the Belgian battery materials and catalysts maker, to “sell” from “neutral” with a €23 target. Pricing pressure and weak global auto production mean a consensus forecast for 19 per cent earnings growth next year looked too high, it said.  A field trip to China suggested recent subsidy cuts have resulted in slower electric vehicle sales, said UBS. It also said adoption of next-generation cathode technology, known as NMC 811, had slowed and battery pack producers “are taking any opportunity they can to push prices down”. The global battery market was likely to be oversupplied by 2025 as Chinese subsidies expire and production alliances in Europe open bottlenecks, it said.  UBS cut its earnings per share forecasts for Umicore by an average of 15 per cent for the next three years, putting it around 15 per cent below consensus for 2021. While Umicore’s premium product and market share leadership deserve a higher valuation than peer Johnson Matthey, the company’s positioning in the “squeezed middle of the battery supply chain” still meant negative free cash flow generation until 2022, it said. ● In brief: Endesa cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Experian cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Fluidra rated new “overweight” at JPMorgan; Fresenius Medical cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Gestamp raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Getinge raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Glencore cut to “market perform” at BMO; Iberdrola cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Kainos rated new “buy” at Stifel; Kone cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Meggitt raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Naturgy Cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Oerlikon cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Sika cut to “sell” at UBS.

"Germany’s Metro warns Kretinsky bid would burden the company","Wholesale retailer and Czech billionaire clash over merits of €5.8bn takeover","Germany’s wholesale retailer Metro warned that a €5.8bn takeover offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky would “burden” the company with too much debt as it urged shareholders to reject the bid. EP Global Commerce, which is controlled by Mr Kretinsky and his Slovakian business partner Patrik Tkac, made its offer last month. They already own 17.5 per cent of Metro and have the option to buy another 15.2 per cent from German holding company Haniel. 
 Olaf Koch, Metro’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that the company’s management was not against the company going private but that the offer from EP Global Commerce was unconvincing. Accepting it would “not just put a question mark behind Metro’s credit rating, it would render it obsolete”, Mr Koch told journalists. Mr Kretinsky amassed his fortune in the energy industry, having picked up assets cheaply in Germany, Italy and the UK. More recently his empire has expanded beyond energy, with the purchase last year of a stake in the publisher of French newspaper Le Monde. EP Global Commerce rejected Mr Koch’s claim, arguing that the equity portion of the bid stands at €2.5bn. Its offer will also be partly financed through loans provided by BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Société Générale. It is offering €16 for each Metro share it does not already own, and €13.80 for each preference share. “Our capital structure for the offer is very solid and supports a sustained growth strategy for Metro,” a spokesperson for EP Global said. Shares in Metro slipped 1 per cent to €15.40. Mr Koch’s comments on the offer came after Metro reported a 3.4 per cent increase in like-for-like sales between April and June. However, the group’s Russian operations, which have been under pressure, suffered another 4.8 per cent drop in revenues. The sale of Metro’s German supermarket chain Real is taking longer than initially planned and will only be concluded by September, the company said.  Metro was once a retail conglomerate with businesses stretching from electronics to department stores, but has been offloading assets in a bid to focus on its food business. EP Global’s offer to investors is open until August 7, and is contingent on at least 67.5 per cent of shareholders accepting it. Metro said the offer price was just 2.9 per cent above the closing price of the day before EP Global Commerce announced its offer. However, EP Global rejected that analysis, arguing that the relevant reference point to calculate the premium is August 2018, when it started to build its stake. Relative to Metro’s share price then, EP Global Commerce is offering a premium of more than 30 per cent.  ","24.07.2019"
"Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan’s grip on tech IPOs under threat after Uber","Weak debuts for ride-hailing apps prompt banking rivals to chase new business","Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have a vice-like grip on advising top technology companies. After Uber and Lyft’s weak initial public offerings, rival banks are hoping for some market disruption.  “The quality of deal execution is being called into question more, by both corporates and VCs [venture capital firms],” said David Hermer, head of equity capital markets at Credit Suisse, noting that a “small number of banks have a disproportionate share of leadership roles in technology IPO”. Prized as much for the reputational halo it offers as the hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in big mandates, the business of taking tech companies public has been highly concentrated since the 2000 dotcom crash, when many banks withdrew from the battered sector. Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan earned 55 per cent of the $400m-plus fees generated by US tech IPOs last year, triple the bounty of the next three highest paid banks, according to data provider Refinitiv. The trio have held the top three places since 2011 with a share that is far larger than the 38 per cent of fees they command in the broader $1.9bn-a-year US IPO fee pool. The recent post-IPO share price falls for Lyft and Uber offer hope to rivals as they set out their stall to companies such as Airbnb and WeWork that are considering flotations.  History suggests the upstarts face an uphill battle. To dislodge the top three, challengers such as Credit Suisse, Bank of America, Citigroup, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are pitted against some of the most well-connected bankers in Silicon Valley.  “When you’re a tech entrepreneur and you’re taking your company public, introducing new risk into the equation is not something you’re jumping to do,” said Howard Lerman, chief executive and co-founder of Yext, an enterprise software company. “By going with a tried and true [adviser], you are not going to do something crazy.” Yext's 2017 IPO was led by Morgan Stanley. Mr Lerman said the longstanding relationship between the bank and his chief financial officer, Steve Cakebread, made it the obvious choice. Mr Cakebread had worked with Morgan Stanley on the IPOs of Salesforce and Pandora when he was CFO of those companies. “Between those three banks, they keep each other honest,” Mr Lerman said, referring to Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan.  The trio benefited as some rivals retrenched after the financial crisis; they also capitalised on demand for additional services from tech companies who were staying private for longer. Private placements were particularly popular, such as the 2015 $1.6bn private placement that Goldman led for Uber. It was a deal that was backed by Goldman’s own private wealth clients. “We have been long-term players in this industry,” said Dan Dees, co-head of Goldman’s investment banking division. “We have committed resource. We have kept our people here. We have maintained the commitment to the business through the lean times.” Goldman and Morgan Stanley bankers were roaming Silicon Valley in the 1990s when tech underwriting business was most associated with the “Four Horsemen” — boutique investment banks Alex Brown, Hambrecht & Quist, Robertson Stephens and Montgomery Securities — which have long since been taken over by bigger institutions. Morgan Stanley alumni from that time include the noted venture capitalist Mary Meeker. Goldman is also a prolific early investor in tech companies, getting in early with household names like Spotify and Uber as well as less well-known potential IPO candidates such as $2.65bn banking technology company Plaid. Morgan Stanley was also on the pre-IPO roster for Spotify and numerous other unicorns, including cloud storage venture Dropbox, which listed for $9.2bn last year.  While rivals have come close to the top of league tables based on the volume of cash raised by clients, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan earn the lion’s share of the fees. Take Uber, where Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Bank of America will share more than $100m in underwriting fees. Morgan Stanley, which led the IPO, will earn almost twice as much as Goldman and roughly four times BofA’s payout. “There is never a dearth of additional voices that an issuer can tap if they choose to,” said Liz Myers, global head of equity capital markets at JPMorgan. “But they tend to rely on people and views at firms that have the longest record of doing deals in their space.” In some ways JPMorgan is the successful challenger. Since 2000 it has muscled into what some bankers described as a cosy duopoly between Morgan Stanley and Goldman. Its push has been partly fuelled by its ability to lend, using the biggest bank balance sheet in the US, and the provision of other services such as cash management and private banking.  Star bankers also reinforce the status quo. Morgan Stanley has Michael Grimes, who led the charge on Uber as well as IPOs for Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitter and LinkedIn. Goldman has Nick Giovanni — adviser to everyone from Expedia to Skype and Credit Karma — and Kim Posnett, who worked on Uber’s IPO. JPMorgan has Noah Wintroub — whose big clients include Pinterest and Lyft — and Michael Millman, who has advised Dropbox and SurveyMonkey. European rivals who once boasted star bankers have struggled to replace them. That includes Imran Khan, the Credit Suisse banker who led Alibaba’s IPO, and Frank Quattrone, a leading Silicon Valley player who left Credit Suisse in 2003 during a criminal investigation and later founded investment venture Qatalyst. Painful restructurings curbed European banks’ enthusiasm for investing in Silicon Valley.  “European firms, let's face it, they have been under a fair amount of latter-day challenges than the US [banks] that got their footing in the last five years,” said one Deutsche Bank banker. “There has been a little bit of distraction in investing in the business and turnover.”  The relatively small number of tech IPOs is another barrier to entry. A senior banker at one of the big three said it would be difficult for other banks to make serious inroads while the volume of tech IPOs each year remains about 30 or 40, versus the 100-plus IPOs each year a few decades ago. Rivals disagree. Gary Kirkham, co-head of BofA’s global technology, media and telecoms investment banking group, said his bank’s deal backlog suggested that the tech IPO market had become a “four-horse race”. “We’ve got something like 16 IPO transactions on the go right now,” he said.","22.05.2019"
"WeWork board backs takeover by SoftBank","Co-founder Adam Neumann will get nearly $1.7bn to step down as chair","The WeWork board agreed to a multibillion-dollar bailout and investment package from SoftBank on Tuesday, handing control of the cash-strapped company to the Japanese technology group and releasing it from the grip of its co-founder Adam Neumann, according to people briefed on the matter. SoftBank, which was already WeWork’s largest backer, is to pump $6.5bn into the shared office company through new loans and equity, and will provide Mr Neumann a nearly $1.7bn package to step down from the board, the people said.  The SoftBank proposal accepted by the board would set WeWork’s equity valuation at just $8bn, a fraction of the $47bn price tag the property group was assigned in the Japanese company’s last investment round.  SoftBank, founded by Masayoshi Son, is expected to pay Mr Neumann a roughly $185m consulting fee in return for leaving his role as chairman of the board and dropping the extra voting rights on his shares that gave him outsized influence. It also plans to buy nearly $1bn worth of his stock as part of a tender offer for up to $3bn of shares from early investors and employees, and to loan him $500m, the people said. Mr Neumann had loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars outstanding from a number of Wall Street lenders this summer.  He is expected to retain a stake in the company and remain a board observer. WeWork directors had considered a rival rescue financing package from JPMorgan, the bank that led its attempt to go public and with which it has deep ties. But the Wall Street lender was unwilling to include the tender offer for existing shares as part of its package, one person said. The bank believed the tender offer overvalued WeWork equity, and acted as a bailout to Mr Neumann, they added. The deal caps a stunning fall for Mr Neumann, who co-founded WeWork nine years ago and at one point had claim to a stake in the company worth roughly $13bn. His role as chief executive atop the property group came to an end just days after the company aborted an initial public offering, and his fortune is now worth a fraction of that earlier level. Meanwhile, WeWork employees face an uncertain future, with thousands of jobs expected to be cut in a restructuring that will eat up some of the rescue funding in severance payments. WeWork’s sudden change of fortunes comes just weeks after Mr Neumann and his advisers had pitched the company as a fast-growing disrupter of a giant commercial real estate industry, with a mission of “elevating the world’s consciousness”.  People close to the company said that Mr Neumann’s desire to demonstrate that its growth could continue led it to open new properties at an aggressive pace in the third quarter, expecting the IPO to bring in $3bn-$4bn in new equity and unlock a $6bn package of new loans from its banks. Instead, the failure of the IPO and the high upfront cost of fitting out new premises left it facing the prospect of running out of cash as soon as the end of November, the FT was first to report. Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, who took over as co-CEOs from Mr Neumann, have reined in new openings, initiated the sales of some of the businesses WeWork bought — as well as a $60m jet — and were expected to begin lay-offs soon. Marcelo Claure, SoftBank’s chief operating officer, is to become chairman of WeWork under the plan. He is expected to lead a search effort to bring in new management as the company faces a wave of departures, and could look to replace Messrs Minson and Gunningham, two of the people added. WeWork did not respond to multiple requests for comment. SoftBank declined to comment. With WeWork’s valuation cut to $8bn in SoftBank’s rescue package, Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, estimated that the Japanese group would incur losses of around $3.6bn, of which $2.2bn would be from its direct investment in the property group. WeWork’s outstanding bonds slipped marginally on the news of the board’s decision on Tuesday morning, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The loans and payments from SoftBank will help alleviate a potential financial strain on Mr Neumann personally. The cash crunch at WeWork as well as the contemplated repricing of his stake threatened losses to banks including JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Credit Suisse. Mr Neumann’s shares were collateral on some of his loans, and banks can typically demand margin calls if the value of such assets falls below a certain point.  ","22.10.2019"
"Saudi Aramco selects banks for IPO","State oil group chooses range of foreign and local lenders for historic listing","Saudi Aramco has chosen a range of international and local banks, including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, to handle its much-anticipated initial public offering.  Advisers and bankers involved in the IPO said the state oil company had started informing lenders of their mandates on Wednesday as the government accelerates the part-privatisation with a view to a local listing later this year. If successful, the historic deal would be one of the world’s largest IPOs, marking renewed intent from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to push through his ambitious economic transformation plan. The world’s most profitable company intends to launch the IPO process as early as Friday, gathering the banks to allocate specific assignments. Many of the lenders, such as JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC, had been working on the process before it stalled last year. Others, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, are new to the process. Saudi banks taking part include National Commercial Bank and Samba. Some of these banks said they were still in the running to be leaders on the IPO, with no final decision yet made or communicated to them. They were among as many as 40 banks that this month attended a “beauty parade” in Saudi Aramco’s London office to pitch for their roles, managed by one of the company’s financial advisers, Lazard. JPMorgan, regarded as the kingdom’s in-house global bank, is expected to be most prominent in the process. Officials have privately floated the idea of listing 1 per cent of the company’s shares on Riyadh’s Tadawul market, with another 1 per cent next year. Amin Nasser, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive, said this week that the IPO would take place “very soon”.
 A local listing, which would sidestep legal complications and onerous disclosure requirements, could later be extended to an overseas listing. Khalid al-Falih was dramatically ousted as chairman of Saudi Aramco and energy minister this month. Saudi advisers said he was regarded as insufficiently enthusiastic about pushing through the privatisation of the kingdom’s main revenue earner. He was replaced by Prince Mohammed’s close aide Yasir al-Rumayyan, head of the sovereign Public Investment Fund, which is expected to be the main recipient of the IPO proceeds. The plan to list up to 5 per cent of Saudi Aramco — the centrepiece of Prince Mohammed’s reform programme — has targeted a valuation for the company of up to $2tn. Some banks are believed to have pitched for their IPO mandate at valuations of up to $2.5tn, although industry analysts have warned a range of $1tn-$1.5tn is more realistic. Global banks have in recent months rushed to be part of the listing following Saudi Arabia’s revival of the process after the issuance of its first major international bond was heavily oversubscribed. Wall Street’s aggressive lobbying to play a big role in the listing stands in sharp contrast to 11 months ago, when top bankers such as JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh following the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  But bankers, who often complain about low fees in Saudi Arabia, said they did not expect a huge payday from their IPO work. “There won’t be much money to be made,” said one banker working on the offering. “But it’s all about prestige — and the league tables.”","11.09.2019"
"Mozambique goes to polls as gas billions begin to flow","Country braced for massive investment after discovery of huge energy reserves off coast","Ana Maria João Valeda, a 54-year-old housewife living in Mozambique’s port city of Beira, likes President Filipe Nyusi so much she wears a capulana wraparound fabric imprinted with his face. She credits Mr Nyusi’s Frelimo party, which has ruled Mozambique for more than four decades, with helping repair the damage caused when Cyclone Idai tore through the country in March, killing 1,300 people. “Our house crumbled and we had nothing to eat, but then the government brought in foreign aid and we started getting food and clothes,” she said.  “They even brought in the Pope to bless us,” she added, referring to last month’s visit by the pontiff, which Frelimo used to burnish its credentials ahead of presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections on October 15. The elections come at a crucial time for Mozambique. Although one of the world’s poorest countries, Mozambique is braced for massive investment after the discovery of huge gas reserves off its northern coast. Anadarko in June committed to a $25bn liquefied natural gas project, which will be transferred to Total following its agreement to buy the US energy company’s African assets. Exxon is expected to invest in another similar sized project. Eni, the Italian oil group, hopes to be producing from its $8bn floating LNG facility by 2023.  The prospect of billions of dollars flooding in has triggered fears about whether Mozambique’s institutions, weakened by decades of single-party rule, are strong enough to resist the “resource curse” that has blighted other African countries.  Violence blamed on a shadowy Islamist group has already broken out in the northern Cabo Delgado province where gas discoveries have been made. The government has also been embroiled in a scandal after it was revealed, in 2016, that it had borrowed $2bn in secret loans, much of it still unaccounted for.  US prosecutors have indicted three former Credit Suisse bankers for alleged fraud and are demanding the extradition of Manuel Chang, the former Mozambique finance minister arrested in South Africa in January. The so-called tuna bond scandal — much of the money had been borrowed to start a phantom tuna-fishing fleet — prompted a break with the IMF, which stopped its lending programme. That in turn contributed to an economic slump after years of relatively strong growth, obliging the government to rein in expenditure. Cyclone Idai killed 1,300 people when it tore through Mozambique in March. The government brought in foreign aid to repair the damage. © AFP Mr Nyusi, who is running for a second term, has sought to prove he is dealing with the scandal by cranking up anti-corruption rhetoric and allowing an investigation into the missing funds. Twenty officials have been arrested, including the son of former president Armando Guebuza.  “They agreed that, in order to stay in power, some sacrifices had to be made,” said Adriano Nuvunga, director of the Maputo-based Centre for Democracy and Development. The arrests, he said, were “essentially an arrangement by the elite to save the regime in the next election”.  The tactic could well work. Few expect Mr Nyusi to be seriously challenged by Ossufo Momade, who took over as head of the opposition Renamo party in January following the death of its longtime leader Afonso Dhlakama, the former guerrilla leader.  Still, Mr Nyusi has ceded some ground to Renamo in what Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at the Chatham House think-tank, described as an “elite bargain”.  In August, Frelimo concluded a peace deal with Renamo, with which it fought a bitter civil war from 1977-1992 and with which it has been in low-level conflict for much of the period since independence. All but a tiny handful of Renamo holdouts have given up their military struggle.  The rest are placing their faith in the electoral process, encouraged by a change in the constitution allowing provinces to appoint their own governors, which theoretically weakens central authority. That should enable Renamo to gain ground in its regional strongholds, including in Nampula province, the home base of Mr Momade.  Weekly podcast

  Sign up here to the new podcast from Gideon Rachman, the FT’s chief foreign affairs columnist, and listen in on his conversations with the decision-makers and thinkers from all over the globe who are shaping world affairs Renamo is also hoping to win in Sofala province, of which Beira is the capital and where the Democratic Movement of Mozambique, the country’s third political force, is also strong.  Despite the peace deal with Renamo, campaigning has been marred by violence and intimidation. On Tuesday Mozambique’s police admitted that they had gunned down an election observer in a province rife with claims of rigging by Frelimo and have pledged an investigation.  Paulo Arone, a Renamo delegate in Beira, said the tuna-bond scandal was undermining Frelimo’s credibility. “It is difficult to have real development with so much corruption. Where did those $2bn go?” he asked. Yet even if Frelimo is defeated in a few provinces, including Nampula and Sofala, the electoral fallout from the missing loans scandal is likely to be limited. “There are these corruption and debt issues, but they do not affect rural areas much,” said Manuel Tomé, a member of Frelimo’s political commission.  For most of Mozambique’s 30m people, struggling at subsistence level, the financial shenanigans in Maputo are not a pressing issue, he said.  Mia Couto, a writer and former Frelimo member, acknowledged Mr Nyusi had deftly opened up the political space. “Today, there is no need to kill any more,” he said of a political system about to be lubricated by billions of dollars.  “Other avenues are open to maintain power, like distributing influence, advantages and privileges,” Mr Couto said.

"Stocks to watch: Airbus, Safran, LVMH, Tullow, Prosus, Cineworld","Hammerson’s luxury outlet villages may be key to a revival, says Goldman Sachs","Monday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Airbus led the explorers lower on reports that the World Trade Organization had formally approved a US request to impose tariffs on some European goods, the latest chapter in a 15-year tit-for-tat dispute over aircraft subsidies. The settlement panel on the Airbus-Boeing dispute had sent a confidential ruling to the European Commission and the US Trade Representative that gave the US the right to impose “punitive tariffs” on EU products “from cheeses to Airbus planes and parts”, Politico reported. The WTO still needs to rule on an Airbus counterclaim that Boeing was being supported by subsidies from the US government, which is running six to nine months behind Boeing’s claim against Airbus. Customers based in the US will represent an estimated 17 per cent of Airbus deliveries in 2020, said analysts. Morgan Stanley argued that the risks may be more severe for Safran, whose US-based joint venture with General Electric accounts for most of its production, and German engineering group MTU, a key supplier to US engine maker Pratt & Whitney. “We think tariffs would represent increased costs to most industry players given the concentration of supply and the global nature of supply chains. The industry is a duopoly/oligopoly that is operating at capacity, so the potential for shifting supply around would be very limited . . . Our longstanding view has been that this washes out to neutral over time. However, we see the possibility for some turbulence to deliveries in the short term. If tariffs were imposed, it is possible some US customers could seek to delay deliveries until a settlement is reached, possibly after a ruling in the reciprocal case. This could mean a back-end loaded delivery profile in 2020, or even some deferrals.”Morgan Stanley ● LVMH, Christian Dior and Rémy Cointreau all slid on worries that any WTO ruling would affect luxury goods and alcohol imports from Europe.  “The US is the largest market for European spirits companies and is a key part to what gives spirits superior growth versus staples. Whilst there is still no clarity on scope/quantum/duration of potential tariffs, we believe that the WTO decision over Airbus subsidies increases the likelihood of higher tariffs on certain EU spirits into the US.”Jefferies Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs upgraded Hammerson, the shopping centre developer, from “neutral” to “buy” with a 303p-a-share target price. “We believe Hammerson will increasingly consider more strategic decisions including monetising part or all of its Premium Outlet businesses,” it said. Hammerson’s VIA Outlets and Value Retail parks, which are externally managed and aimed at international tourists, have been growing sales and rental income well ahead of the group average, said Goldman. Ownership is by a “somewhat complex” arrangement whereby Hammerson has 39 per cent exposure to Value Retail and a 50 per cent exposure to VIA Outlets. The division was given a £1.7bn equity value and £900m of debt in Hammerson’s half-year accounts. At a recent investor day, Hammerson management seemed open to selling stakes in the ventures and did not expect any disposal to create significant tax liabilities, said Goldman. “While there are no other listed premium outlet businesses, we believe Shaftesbury is the closest peer,” it said. Shaftesbury has an enterprise value of 36.9-times trading profit which, if applied to Hammerson’s operations, would value the division at £2.24bn or 292p a share, the broker estimated.  Goldman scaled back that valuation to 247p a share for its price target, which added just 56p for the remainder of Hammerson’s business. ● Jefferies started coverage of Prosus, the Amsterdam-listed technology investment arm of South Africa’s Naspers, with an “underperform” rating and a €61 price target. The broker argued that Naspers’ deep valuation discount to the net value of its assets, which include a significant stake in China’s Tencent, was not solely a “South African problem”. “Naspers (clearly the same assets, control structure, management and strategy as Prosus, plus a de minimis South African business) traded at a discount ranging from 30 per cent to 40 per cent during the two years prior to the announcement of the Prosus spin earlier this year. Our core thesis is that the same fate could befall Prosus after the current index/quasi-index flows have subsided. Lessons from the Altaba-SoftBank spectrum or from European holdcos [holding companies] is that opaque private company investments, with little cash return to shareholders, governance that doesn’t prioritise the discount, and assets that aren’t substitutable/hedgeable (Tencent doesn’t trade on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange) all point to wide discounts.”Jefferies Naspers’ majority ownership of Prosus seeds distrust, particularly given “obfuscatory accounting” and a control structure that made shareholder activism and takeover impossible, said Jefferies. It also highlighted that no matter how deep the discount, Naspers has never launched a net share buyback, even after raising $11bn from disposals.  ● Investec Securities upgraded Tullow Oil from “hold” to “buy” with a 250p target price as part of an exploration sector review. Its note preceded both a positive drill update from Tullow’s offshore Guyana prospect and an attack on Saudi Arabian infrastructure that sent oil prices higher by up to 20 per cent.  Tullow’s discovery in Guyana “has shown that transformational discoveries can still be made and valuations remain attractive with the sector generally still trading at an average circa 20 per cent discount to risked exploration net asset value”, said Investec.  “After a hiatus in exploration activity, Tullow’s Guyana success could now turn the market’s attention back to exploration. Currently, exploration has all but been removed from valuations, however Tullow’s success in Guyana can hopefully again demonstrate there is still value in searching for new barrels . . . The company’s east African assets have struggled to progress over the past decade and success in Guyana has now opened up a variety of options for the company. With its high working interest (60 per cent), we expect the company to monetise all or part of its stake which would fix the balance sheet issue that still lingers in the background.”Investec Investec’s other high-conviction “buy” recommendations were Premier Oil and Seplat, with Cairn Energy highlighted on exploration potential. Soco International, downgraded to “sell”, was its only negative recommendation in the sector. Soco’s Vietnamese portfolio “has struggled to perform with multiple operational hiccups over the past 12 months and we are now less confident in management’s ability to turn the asset around”, said Investec. “Combined with an uninspiring deal in Egypt, we see the company stuck in limbo as to what to do next.” Soco has historically struggled to convert prospects into proven reserves and the investment required puts the dividend that underpins the share price at risk, it said. ● In brief: 888 rated new “hold” at Stifel; ASR Nederland raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Cineworld rated new “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Coface cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Deutsche Wohnen raised to “buy” at Goldman; Eni cut to “hold” at Berenberg; EssilorLuxottica raised to “buy” at UBS; Go-Ahead cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Hannover Re cut to “underweight” at JPMorgan; Icade cut to “neutral” at Goldman; Mapfre cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Mediolanum cut to “neutral” at UBS; Next raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Orsted cut to “hold” at HSBC; Safran raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Schmolz + Bickenbach cut to “neutral” at UBS; Soco cut to “sell” at Investec; Swiss Life cut to “underweight” at JPMorgan.

"Credit Suisse escapes harsh criticism on ‘tuna bond’ affair","US prosecutors seem to take sympathetic view of bank in Mozambique scandal","The arrest of three former Credit Suisse bankers in connection with the $2bn “tuna bonds” scandal in Mozambique has turned the spotlight on the Swiss bank — but the charges suggest US prosecutors have taken a sympathetic view of the lender. The indictment filed by the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of New York highlighted failings by Credit Suisse’s compliance department, even as prosecutors seemed receptive to the bank’s argument that it had been the victim of rogue employees.  “The indictment adopts, frankly, the bank’s narrative that these are rogues, they lied to us, they did this in secret, etc,” said Patrick Cotter, a former US federal prosecutor. He noted that the charging document said the former bankers had acted “secretly” and “withheld” or “conspired to withhold” information from their compliance team.  “Those are all phrases that warm the heart of any attorney,” said Mr Cotter, a partner at Greensfelder.  Prosecutors in Brooklyn unveiled charges on Thursday against Andrew Pearse, Detelina Subeva and Surjan Singh, the former bankers, plus a former Mozambique finance minister, and a fifth man. The three former Credit Suisse employees each face four charges of conspiracy: to commit money laundering; to violate the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; to commit wire fraud; and to commit securities fraud. “The seriousness of these offences, particularly in the United States, cannot be underestimated,” said one lawyer involved in the case. Last year the UK Financial Conduct Authority downgraded a criminal probe into the matter to a regulatory one. The trio were arrested in London on Thursday. They have yet to decide whether they will fight extradition. All three were released on conditional bail until their next hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in early March, according to the court.  London-based solicitors for Mr Singh, Mr Pearse and Ms Subeva declined to comment.  The $2bn loans at the heart of the case were marketed to international investors in 2013, ostensibly for financing Mozambique’s fishing industry and coastal security. But they allegedly had a darker purpose and at least a tenth of the money was used for bribes and kickbacks, according to the indictment.  The allegations indicated that Credit Suisse identified red flags around the Mozambique deals but either failed to investigate them aggressively enough or was misled by Mr Pearse, Ms Subeva and Mr Singh.  In one incident, a senior executive in the investment bank objected to the involvement of an executive at Privinvest, an Abu Dhabi-based supplier of boats and gear to the projects, according to the indictment.  A due diligence report maintained by the bank described the unidentified executive as a “master of kickbacks”, prosecutors alleged.  However, an unnamed Credit Suisse employee did not tell the compliance department about the senior executive’s concerns “and the compliance department failed to pursue its inquiry further”, the indictment claimed.  “This was not expected and the allegations made are being investigated by the group,” a spokesperson for Privinvest said of the indictment. On another occasion, Mr Pearse and Ms Subeva allegedly altered loan documents to remove provisions Credit Suisse had put in place to ensure the financing met its internal controls, according to the indictment.  “I cannot believe that it is possible that those modified loan agreements were not approved by a higher level of management at Credit Suisse,” said Mr Cotter, the former federal prosecutor.  Insiders at Credit Suisse said they were encouraged the bank had avoided the heavy criticism prosecutors from the same office levelled at the culture at Goldman Sachs when they indicted the US bank’s former employees in connection with Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal last year. Credit Suisse’s compliance failures detailed in the US indictment and the profit it made on the controversial bond issues are likely to infuriate ordinary Mozambicans saddled with paying back debts that are widely regarded as illegitimate.  “Credit Suisse has to face up to its own responsibility in this case. It is Credit Suisse which lent money to three companies with no income, and without the approval of the Mozambican parliament,” said Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, a UK charity.  Additional reporting by Lauran Noonan in New York and Max Seddon in Moscow

"Stocks to watch: Intu, Anglo American, Hugo Boss, Zalando, Kainos","IQE’s ‘world-beating technology’ can power a recovery, says Panmure Gordon","Friday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● Intu Properties touched a record low after the shopping centre owner warned that the increasing use of company voluntary arrangements by its tenants would hit earnings by more than expected.   Management said that while first-quarter operational performance was stable, CVAs were likely to cut net operating income by between 4 per cent and 6 per cent at the full year. The first half may be worse than the second, Intu cautioned, with CVAs dragging on net operating income by an additional 1 per cent to 2 per cent in the first six months. Intu also noted a slowdown in UK new lettings as macro uncertainties led tenants to delay decisions. The growing use of CVAs may stall Intu’s asset disposal plans because the higher risk would lead potential buyers to expect a higher yield, said Citigroup. “We retain our sell recommendation as asset values are expected to fall further, loan-to-value covenants [are] tested and earnings per share [are] pressured on the downside as the market awaits the new way forward from new chief executive Matthew Roberts,” Citi said. Sellside stories ● UBS downgraded Direct Line to “neutral” and cut Admiral to “sell” in a review of the UK non-life insurance sector. It cited an increasingly uncertain outlook for motor policy pricing. “UK motor insurance pricing has disappointed year to date and continues to lag elevated claims inflation; margins are under pressure. Amidst deteriorating fundamentals, we had expected pricing to gradually converge with claims inflation in early 2019. This has not been the case, with competition more severe than expected, we understand driven by mid-market competitors. Whilst valuations are relatively undemanding (in the most part) and dividend yields supportive, we turn more negative due to increasing profitability headwinds; we calculate our loss ratio expectations are zero to four percentage points worse than those embedded in share prices.”UBS The broker also saw risks around home insurance back books from the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation into renewals pricing. Direct Line, with 20 per cent of earnings coming from home insurance, looked most exposed it said. ● Credit Suisse upgraded Anglo American from “neutral” to “outperform” with a £23.50 target, raised from £16.10. “We believe Anglo American is differentiating itself from peers by focusing on high-quality organic growth rather than prioritising large cash returns to shareholders,” said Credit Suisse. Projects under development are big enough to move the needle for Anglo, driving copper-equivalent volume growth of about 20 per cent to 2024 versus peer growth of less than 5 per cent, it said. Few analysts have included in their models the capital expenditure required for yet-to-be-approved expansion projects, so updates should provide a progressive positive catalyst for the stock, it said. ● Panmure Gordon started coverage of IQE, the Welsh chip wafer maker, with “buy” advice and a 120p target in a UK technology sector review. “IQE is something of an enigma. World-beating technology in multiple compound materials markets that all look set to exhibit strong and sustained growth, but with a trajectory that keeps stalling. We are firm believers that IQE has the technology required to dominate several of these markets and with drivers including 5G, lidar [light detection sensors], 3D sensing, compound semiconductors on silicon, mass-market infrared applications and the emergence of a new market for compound semiconductor wireless filters, we believe IQE’s long term future is bright and the shares have considerable upside potential.”Panmure IQE has been substantially derated over the past 18 months as it “suffered bear raids and some serious visibility issues around the timing of revenues”, said Panmure. “However, our confidence in the longer-term opportunity remains undimmed and we see an excellent entry point for those with patience and the potential for IQE to re-test its 2017 highs around 180p on an 18 month to two-year view.” Panmure also put “buy” ratings on software makers Ideagen and Learning Technologies with price target of 165p and 110p respectively. GB Group and Kainos were both rated “hold”.  ● In brief: Cyan rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Deutsche Post reinstated “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Freenet cut to “sell” at UBS; Greencoat UK Wind downgraded to “negative” at Stifel; Hugo Boss raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; John Laing rated new “outperform” at Macquarie; Kion cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Lancashire downgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Logitech raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Nemetschek rated new “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Network International rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Nichols raised to “hold” at Shore Capital; Nordic Entertainment new “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Schroders cut to “neutral” at UBS; Siemens Healthineers downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Unilever raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Wacker Chemie upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Zalando raised to “hold” at Société Générale.

"Barclays/Jes Staley: the holdout","The verdict is still out on chief executive’s commitment to investment banking","Maybe European investment banking is not a disaster zone, after all. Barclays’ unit pulled off a respectable second quarter. Profits edged higher, burnishing the UK bank’s otherwise lacklustre results. Revenues from markets activities fell less than at US rivals. Chief executive Jes Staley’s commitment to full-scale investment banking looks less dangerous. He still has not proved his point.  Mr Staley has fought hard on behalf of Barclays’ unloved traders and corporate rainmakers. Activist investor Edward Bramson wanted deep cuts in a volatile, capital-consuming business. He was seen off earlier this year. Since then, weaker rival Deutsche Bank has announced deep cuts — clearing the field for Mr Staley, perhaps. Other continental European competitors see investment bankers increasingly as mere support service workers for more reliably profitable businesses, such as wealth management.  Global market turbulence ripped through European banks’ trading rooms late last year. A trading rebound was inevitable. Sustaining the improvement matters more for Barclays. Investment banking accounts for about half of risk-weighted assets, compared with a third at BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse.  Investment banking still fails to excite, however. Returns on tangible equity in the corporate and investment bank were 9.3 per cent. Even in a weak quarter, Barclays’ UK banking division generated 13.9 per cent returns. The cards and payments division managed 18 per cent. In comparison, Société Générale’s investment bank, still mid-restructuring, reported underlying 10 per cent second-quarter returns on Thursday. Overall, Barclays targets returns above 10 per cent by 2020. Cost cutting has been stepped up. Scepticism remains. The analysts’ consensus sees returns sticking below 9 per cent in 2020 and 2021.  Barclays’ shares edged higher on Thursday,  but remain a fifth lower than a year ago, no better than European stocks. But low double-digit returns are probably as good as it gets, at least until interest rates rise again.  Big Wall Street banks generate returns into the high teens. The gap is largely explained by lower European borrowing costs, which have eroded margins. European bankers complain, too, about unfair regulatory burdens. Like rivals, Barclays’ shares trade below book value — in its case, just 0.6 times. This looks cheap, relative even to Barclays’ modest profitability. UK banks bear an additional discount because of worries about a chaotic Brexit. Not even Barclays’ investment bankers can do much about that. ","01.08.2019"

Donald Trump became the fourth US president to face impeachment proceedings after Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused him of betraying the office and US national security in a televised address by seeking Ukraine’s help in the 2020 election.  The impeachment inquiry is the first since the House impeached Bill Clinton in 1998 and came only hours after Mr Trump sought to blunt Democratic criticism by promising to release a transcript of his controversial July 25 telephone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian president. The transcript of the call, which the president said was “perfect”, will be released today.  The scandal erupted after an unidentified whistleblower in the intelligence community raised concerns about conversations Mr Trump held with a foreign leader, later revealed to be Mr Zelensky. Here’s more on how we got here. Joseph Maguire, the acting head of the US intelligence community, has refused to give Congress the whistleblower’s complaint, which Ms Pelosi said was a “violation” of US law. In addition to the transcript, Democrats are demanding a copy of the complaint. Mr Maguire is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee today. Mr Trump has acknowledged speaking to Mr Zelensky about the Bidens. He has also confirmed that he personally decided to withhold nearly $400m of military aid to Ukraine before making the call to the Ukrainian president. But the president has denied he was attempting to pressure him. He called the start of impeachment proceedings a “witch hunt”. Today, he is due to hold a meeting with the Ukraine president at the UN in New York.  Here’s a guide to how the impeachment process works. For an indication of how the process will play out, Edward Luce says the impeachment of Richard Nixon in 1974 is a better guide than those of Bill Clinton in 1998 or Andrew Johnson in 1868.

"Will Hong Kong stock exchange’s bid for its London rival end in tragedy?","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. What can you do when you’ve got your eye on someone but they’ve already said they’re interested in someone else?  Hong Kong’s stock exchange used the oldest trick in the book: flattery.  Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which has just made a surprising and unsolicited $32bn bid for the London Stock Exchange, described the potential pairing as “a corporate Romeo and Juliet story”.   DD can see why the analogy to tragic lovers makes sense.  Both territories are striving for independence. Britain is in political turmoil as the date to leave the EU approaches with no withdrawal deal in sight and Hong Kong has seen four months of protests over the territory’s autonomy from Beijing.  In a conference call on Wednesday, Li said HKEX knew it was late in making its move but wanted to express its admiration. As the English say, flattery will get you nowhere.  LSE, which has already agreed to buy the data and trading group Refinitiv for $27bn, is unlikely to accept the Hong Kong bourse’s advances. Two people close to the company’s board told the FT that it’s leaning towards rejecting the Hong Kong approach.   The proposal would combine two of the world’s most powerful trading centres, connecting east to west, at a pivotal time for the global exchange industry. The courtship comes at an opportune time.  Hong Kong’s businesses are caught in the crossfire between mainland China and local protesters, eager to come across as proponents of peace to the western world without incurring the wrath of Beijing.  A deal with one of the UK’s most important financial institutions could take the spotlight away from what’s happening at home. As the FT’s Jamil Anderlini says in his column, it’s an attempt to present a “business as usual” face to the world.  Even Li himself probably thinks it’s a long-shot. The UK government may be paralysed over Brexit but it’s unlikely to sign off on a deal that hands over one of the most critical assets in the UK financial system.  If all that isn’t enough to put the LSE off a deal, wait until it hears from its colleagues over at the London Metal Exchange that their Hong Kong owners banned a truly loved English tradition — drinking at lunchtime.  Check out the FT’s Lex column for a breakdown of the offer.  Don’t bite the hand that feeds you   The General Motors building in midtown Manhattan is one of the best-known structures on the New York skyline with sweeping view of Central Park. It houses Apple’s flagship store with its iconic glass cube on the plaza.  Inside the building you’ll find prominent financial institutions, including Icahn Enterprises and JC Flowers. Among them are the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges and the boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, which is also a client of Weil’s.  The two groups have a longstanding relationship. PWP was conceived in Weil’s office by Joe Perella and Weil represented the boutique firm in a brutal legal fight with one of its most successful dealmakers, Michael Kramer.  (If you don’t know the fascinating story, check out this big read by DD’s Sujeet Indap and James Fontanella-Khan.) So imagine the surprise of PWP employees when they were told on August 30 that Weil had “revoked” the investment bank’s “cafeteria privileges”.  Now DD hasn’t visited Weil’s cafeteria so we don't know what PWP workers are missing out on. It did get a mention in The Liar’s Ball, a book by Vicky Ward on the wheeling and dealing that went on behind the scenes when real estate developer Harry Macklowe bought the building in 2003 from none other than Donald Trump.  PWP employees were left in the dark about what had prompted Weil to close the door. Weil didn't respond to a request for comment and PWP declined to comment.  Could it have something to do with a recent story by the New York Post that claimed Weil had “botched” pay packages for two of PWP’s bankers, one of which was Kramer? For all the hungry investment bankers left out in the cold, we hear there’s a Sweetgreen around the corner. Saudi Aramco crowns its IPO advisers  
  
  It was the pitch of their lives.  As many as 40 banks attended a “beauty parade” in Saudi Aramco’s London office last week to vie for a role in one of the most played out initial public offerings the financial markets have seen.  Some were familiar faces — JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC had been working on the process before it stalled last year — while others had just entered the race.  Three years in the making, Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant has kept its advisers waiting, at times quite literally.  But on Wednesday Aramco finally named some of the banks that will be handling its IPO. The oil giant chose a range of international and local banks, including JPM and Morgan Stanley, to handle the historic stock market listing.  No surprises there. The two banks have dedicated a huge amount of time and manpower to the cause for little in return. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are also expected to take part in the process, alongside the Saudi banks National Commercial Bank and Samba. For once, Wall Street’s aggressive lobbying to take part in the listing isn’t about money. Bankers working on the offering have told the FT they’re not expecting a huge payout. It’s about the prestige of working on the world’s largest IPO. Timing is still elusive, however. Amin Nasser (pictured above), Aramco’s chief executive, said this week that the IPO would take place “very soon”.

"Hong Kong’s rich open foreign bank accounts amid unrest","Singapore benefits as wealthy residents hedge against political stand-off","Thousands of Hong Kong’s wealthy residents are opening bank accounts in Singapore and other financial centres, as they make contingency plans to protect themselves against a prolonged period of unrest in the territory. UBS, HSBC, Pictet and Credit Suisse are among the banks to have had a sharp increase in Hong Kong customers opening overseas accounts, according to people familiar with the matter. The trend has accelerated as the mass protests over Beijing’s alleged threat to Hong Kong’s autonomy continue for a fourth month, they said. One European bank has seen a rise in account openings, but less than 1 per cent of deposits held by its Hong Kong customers have actually moved, according to an executive briefed on the matter. “Hong Kong’s loss is Asean’s gain,” they said. Another executive said they had told Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, about the trend, warning that the financial hub risked seeing capital flight if the stand-off between the protesters and the Beijing-backed local government was not resolved soon. However, they said little cash had actually left, with wealthy clients positioning themselves for the worst. Meanwhile, an executive at a Singaporean bank with operations in Hong Kong said more accounts have been opened in the last three months than ever before, with the bulk being medium-sized accounts which typically range from S$1m-S$2m ($730,000-$1.4m).  Singapore: One bank in the city state said applications from Hong Kongers for accounts had skyrocketed in the past three months © AFP via Getty Images Sparked by the introduction in June of a bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China for the first time, the protests have thrown Hong Kong’s future into doubt just as the US-China trade war saps its economy. In August, retail sales fell by a record amount for a single month, while visitors to the city plunged 40 per cent. Earlier this week, the IMF slashed its 2019 growth forecast for the territory to 0.3 per cent, down from a 2.7 per cent projection made in April. Ms Lam said on Wednesday that Hong Kong had entered a “technical recession”, as pro-democracy protesters forced her annual policy speech to be suspended. Losing the money and confidence of some of its richest residents, as well as the upper echelons of the middle class, would exacerbate the downturn and threaten its position as Asia’s premier financial centre. Hong Kong legislature suspended as protests erupt in chamberSubtitles unavailable “European cities had been losing ground to Hong Kong for years, but that situation is reversing now,” one bank executive told the FT. “There is now a lot of interest in shifting money out of Hong Kong.” “We are just at the first stages, people are enquiring and . . . [some] are opening accounts in Singapore, but not moving their cash just yet,” they added. “Also, London and Switzerland are not looking such bad places to move money, despite Brexit, considering all the Asia turmoil at the margins.” The executive at the Singaporean bank said that three months ago it was receiving about 80 applications a month to open accounts from a variety of clients, from the lower end up to private banking level. But the number of applications has skyrocketed, driven mainly by Hong Kong-based clients looking to hedge themselves against an intensification of the unrest, they said. In August, the bank received 400 applications to open accounts, taking the total this year to about 600. So far, about 75 to 80 per cent of applications have translated into account openings, given that the bank needs to complete know-your-customer and due diligence procedures, the executive said. Only a few Hong Kong clients — many of whom already had a relationship with the bank — have transferred money into these new Singapore accounts since protests kicked off, for a total of about S$300-400m, the banker said. Private banking clients do not account for the bulk of these new openings given that they tend to already have a network of accounts with different banking institutions, the executive said. Spokespeople for the four banks declined to comment. Foreign banks, eager to make inroads into China’s fast-growing economy, have had to tread carefully when dealing with its authorities. UBS was forced to suspend one of its senior economists over the summer when he made remarks relating to a bout of swine fever in China that were interpreted as insulting. He has since been reinstated and returned to work. *This story has been amended to correct an editing mistake.

"How the Federal Reserve could fix the repo market","Central bank urged to restart asset purchases to soothe short-term funding glitches","The Federal Reserve is facing urgent calls to find a permanent fix to short-term funding strains that unsettled markets last month, and avoid another bout of volatility at the end of the year when the demand for cash is expected to rise again. Traders were shocked in September when the typically staid market for repurchase agreements — where banks and investors borrow money in exchange for Treasuries and other high-quality collateral — went haywire. The “repo” rate jumped as high as 10 per cent, prompting accusations that the Fed had lost control of short-term interest rates.  A series of cash injections by the central bank brought the rate back down, but policymakers and investors are pushing for a longer-term answer to the market’s problems.  “[The Fed] is doing the right things right now with the short-term repo facilities, but it is merely buying time,” said Bill Campbell, a portfolio manager at investment firm DoubleLine Capital. Market participants have coalesced around one answer: asset purchases. When the Fed buys Treasuries from the market, it simultaneously credits banks’ reserve accounts to pay for them, increasing the amount of cash in the financial system. But opinions remain divided on how much debt the central bank should buy and at what maturities. There is, at least, general agreement that something fundamental needs to be done. At the worst of the market stress, a series of daily $75bn cash injections morphed into $100bn overnight operations and three two-week loans, with banks’ appetite for funding initially outpacing what was on offer from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   The ad hoc intervention eased funding constraints, but the sheer scale of the New York Fed’s operations — with roughly $200bn of cash on loan for the final day of September — emphasised to the market the need for a more lasting solution. Fed chairman Jay Powell nodded to this idea at a press conference last month, saying the central bank will “over time provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required”, in keeping with the “ample reserves” policy it adopted in January.  He did not offer further hints on what a sufficient supply would be, other than to say the Fed was considering resuming the “organic” expansion of its balance sheet by buying Treasury assets to keep up with the growth in physical currency, which counts as a liability. Currency growth has been about $90bn a year since the recovery. But some analysts think the Fed — which is also exploring the role played by regulation   in the repo market’s problems — will have to make more substantial purchases.  Kelcie Gerson, a rates strategist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, said the Fed would need to buy $315bn of shorter-dated Treasury bills between November and May to increase reserves to a level high enough for funding markets to operate normally.  One advantage of this approach is that it distinguishes itself from post-financial crisis quantitative easing, which focused asset purchases on longer-dated Treasuries to help lower interest rates.  Former Fed officials Joseph Gagnon and Brian Sack, now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and hedge fund DE Shaw respectively, believe the Fed should snap up $250bn worth of Treasuries over the next six months.  Meanwhile, Priya Misra at TD Securities calls for $300bn worth of outright purchases of varying maturities over the course of 2020, and roughly $215bn to replace the run-off of maturing mortgage-backed securities previously held on the Fed’s balance sheet. Some market-watchers think that the Fed should announce asset purchases in tandem with a tool that makes its recent temporary cash infusions permanent. Through a so-called standing repo facility, the Fed would pre-commit to doing repo operations on a daily basis with various counterparties so that Treasuries become “cash-like,” according to Praveen Korapaty, chief global rates strategist at Goldman Sachs. The facility garnered much attention at the Fed’s meeting on monetary policy in June, with Fed officials discussing at length how the facility could serve as a “backstop against unusual spikes” in various money market rates as well as flagging potential design pitfalls.  On Tuesday, John Williams, president of the New York Fed, said his staff had been watching its interventions closely to see how to make them as effective as possible, but added that the Fed’s goal was still to make repurchase operations “not a frequent part of controlling interest rates, but obviously always there as needed”. At issue is not only the rate at which the facility would swap Treasuries for cash, but also which financial institutions would be involved.  These parameters could take months to figure out, said Mr Korapaty, adding “now is not a time for experimentation”. If the Fed buys enough Treasuries, a standing repo facility may not be necessary.  “If you increase your balance sheet to a certain size, you don’t need to worry about the minimum level of reserves and you don’t need the facility,” he said. “If they want to operate with abundant reserves, the cleanest way to do it is through asset purchases.” Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse, believes there is a third option. If the Fed were to cut interest rates aggressively — pushing short-term yields below longer-term ones — it would buoy flagging demand for Treasuries from both foreign and domestic buyers and alleviate pressure on the big banks that are obliged to buy the securities.  “The mother of all solutions is more aggressive rate cuts,” he said.","02.10.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Marks and Spencer, Ocado, Glencore, LVMH, Hiscox","China’s V-shaped property recovery should be good for mining stocks, says Goldman","Thursday 11:00 BST Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse downgraded Marks and Spencer to “underperform” from “neutral” with a 250p target price. Its analysis focused on the growing threat from discounters to M&S’s premium food ranges and questioned management’s ambition of doubling its groceries market share. Two-thirds of shoppers now visit Aldi and Lidl, and while M&S has been relatively protected from competition to date, the threat is growing as the discount chains target more affluent areas, Credit Suisse said. It cited Kantar industry data showing M&S losing more market share to Aldi than any other retailer.    Credit Suisse added that the economics of M&S’s groceries joint venture with Ocado were challenging. Pre-tax earnings margins were unlikely to exceed 2 per cent before 2022 and a high proportion of sales will be cannibalised from M&S stores, suggesting a drag to profitability in the early years of the pact, it said. The broker forecast a £50m contribution to group profit by the third year of operation, thanks solely to bulk-buying savings and related synergies.   Given M&S’s dividend cut, its equity issue to fund the Ocado deal, its £1.9bn of net debt and the bleak outlook for earnings, the current high level of cash flow being generated was not enough to support the valuation, Credit Suisse said. It cut earnings-per-share forecasts for the next two years by 16 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.  “Given challenges to both parts of the business, the aggressive strategy for food may end up being correct. However evidence of success may be two to three years away. In the meantime forward price-to-earnings ratios of 12.3 times [for 2019] and 13.9 times [for 2020] look expensive for a company which we expect to report 5 years of declining earnings per share.”Credit Suisse ● HSBC downgraded Ocado to “reduce” from “hold” with a 900p target price. The company’s pivot from online supermarket to technology licensing group “is a sensible one but does not solve the fundamental problems of grocery home delivery”, it said.   Ocado “still faces exposure to what we see as a niche channel with challenged mass-market economics”, said HSBC. The M&S joint venture “has simply pushed this back as investors will now wait for Ocado’s customers to determine whether the model works or not. Our analysis suggests not.” Investors have been too optimistic about the growth opportunity open to Ocado and have underestimated the cash costs of achieving that growth, as has often been the case with online retail, said HSBC. It estimated a value to Ocado from each warehouse built of £110m, based on trading starting by year two and full capacity by year seven. But if capacity fails to ramp up from opening levels the value to Ocado would fall by more than half, it estimated. So, to justify its current valuation, Ocado would need to sign licences for another 40 warehouses, on top of the 25 agreed, HSBC said. That “would effectively require another two Kroger deals and this seems highly optimistic given Kroger represents the biggest possible customer in the biggest market”. “Longer term, we believe Ocado will only succeed if it can enable its customers to succeed too and we believe there is risk here given the challenging economics of grocery home delivery.”HSBC ● Goldman Sachs downgraded Glencore to “neutral” from “buy” in an otherwise upbeat mining sector review. Glencore was downgraded to reflect lower thermal coal prices and seasonally weak production, as well as recent outperformance for the stock.  Chinese policymakers have taken steps to stem slowing growth, which has been reflected in a sharp rise in purchasing managers’ index data and a V-shaped recovery for the property market, Goldman said. While a stronger economy gives the government less reason to ease, the policy will likely remain supportive as withdrawing support “could easily lead to a double dip”, said the broker.  Goldman added Anglo American to its “conviction buy” list of recommended stocks based on higher iron ore forecasts. As part of the same research, Goldman cut Boliden and Aurubis to “sell” on valuation grounds. First Quantum and Lundin Mining were added to its “buy” list.  ● In brief: Alcon rated new “buy” at Société Générale; Dixons Carphone rated new “overweight” at Barclays; Engie cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; EssilorLuxottica upgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Fnac rated new “overweight” at Barclays; GoCompare raised to “buy” at Liberum; Hiscox downgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; IWG raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; KAZ Minerals upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; LVMH raised to “buy” at Société Générale; Lancashire upgraded to “buy” at Berenberg; Neinor raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Prysmian downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Rio Tinto cut to “underperform” at Exane BNP Paribas; Saipem cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; Subsea 7 cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Whitbread downgraded to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley Read more

"Quant strategies fuel investment gains at Man Group","Hedge fund group suffers net outflows as $1.1bn withdrawn in six months to June","Quant strategies propelled investment gains at Man Group in the first half of 2019, although outflows at the world’s largest publicly listed hedge fund group signalled continuing pressure on the industry.  Investors pulled a net $1.1bn in the six months to June, compared with net inflows of $8.3bn a year earlier. But the FTSE 250 group reported positive investment performance of $6.8bn in the period, which boosted its overall assets under management. These rose 5 per cent from the end of last year to $114.4bn, and currency movements provided a $200m fillip. Shares in Man ended 2.6 per cent higher at 171.2p on Wednesday.  The situation was the opposite to that six months ago when Man reported net inflows for the year as a whole but also negative investment performance, following a torrid 2018 for investment managers. Man said its investment gains in the first six months of this year were driven by its quantitative strategies, which use computer algorithms to make investing decisions. The main four strategies in its quantitative AHL unit boosted investment performance, with the funds up between 5.2 per cent and 11.2 per cent in the first half. “Absolute performance was strong in the first half of 2019, particularly in our quant alternative strategies,” said Luke Ellis, chief executive. He added that “commodity trading advisers”, which are computer-driven trend-following funds, tended to do well during periods when it is harder for human investors to discern trading patterns in the market, pointing to record low bond yields in recent months as an example. Many such funds were badly hit in 2018 because of market turmoil at the beginning and end of the year, although the AHL strategies escaped the worst of the carnage. However Mr Ellis stopped short of saying Man’s results indicated a bounceback for quantitative strategies across the industry. “I think trying to predict the future is a mug’s game,” he said. “People tend to think quants are all the same.” Pre-tax profit, adjusted to exclude acquisitions and disposals, impairments and one-off costs, was $157m, up 3 per cent year on year and ahead of expectations of adjusted pre-tax profit of $138m, based on a consensus of seven analysts’ forecasts provided by Man.  The earnings beat was fuelled by an adjusted pre-tax performance fee profit of $74m, compared with $33m a year earlier.  Analysts cheered the results. “Overall this is a good beat,” said Arnaud Giblat, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. “We expect high single-digit to low double-digit upgrade to consensus earnings to reflect the performance fee potential.” Outflows fell between the first and second quarters, coming down from $700m to $400m. Mr Ellis said this reflected a pullback from equity strategies as investors switched to fixed income and credit funds, areas where Man is less present but is looking to grow.  Analysts at Credit Suisse noted Man’s comment that its clients have continued to reduce their active equity exposure into the third quarter, but they added that the performance of quant funds should encourage future inflows. “Man continues to innovate, and we see this supporting longer term fund flows vs near-term headwinds.”  Man reported a statutory pre-tax profit of $110m, up 22 per cent year on year. The group announced an interim dividend of 4.7 cents per share, compared with 6.4 per cents a year earlier. ","31.07.2019"
"Huatai Securities to raise as much as $1.7bn in London listing","Chinese brokerage prices stock towards lower end of range","Brokerage Huatai Securities, the first Chinese group to list in London as part of a link between the two financial centres, has priced its stock towards the lower end of its range to raise as much as $1.7bn.  The Nanjing-based company, one of the biggest brokerages in China, said on Friday its 75m global depositary receipts, or 9 per cent of the outstanding share capital, on offer will cost $20.50 apiece. That will bring its potential funds from that part of the sale to $1.5bn. It had earlier said the price of a maximum 82.5m GDRs would range between $20 and $24.5 each.  Up to 7.5m GDRs will be available as part of the overallotment option which, if exercised in full, will increase the sale size to $1.7bn, 82.5m GDRs and 10 per cent of the group’s capital. The sale will make the financial group the first company to take advantage of a liaison between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges. Conditional trading is set to begin on Monday in London with full trading will kick off on June 20, the group said on Friday. JPMorgan, Huatai Financial Holdings in Hong Kong, and Morgan Stanley are the joint global co-ordinators and bookrunners of the sale. HSBC Bank and Credit Suisse are also involved.","14.06.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Rio Tinto, Aston Martin, ITV, Marston’s, Trainline","Petra Diamonds’ short mine life may make raising cash a struggle, says Berenberg","Wednesday 15:00 BST What’s happening ● Rio Tinto led the UK mining stocks lower as iron ore dropped in response to Vale, the world’s largest producer, saying Brazil had authorised a restart of work at its Vargem Grande complex.  Credit Suisse downgraded Rio to “underperform” while Liberum cut Rio, BHP and Anglo American to “hold”. Both brokers cited the risk that iron ore prices were peaking, with Liberum commenting that “steel inventories at traders have been unseasonally restocking, iron ore port inventory declines have stalled (actually built last week), spot steel mill profitability in China has now fallen to break-even levels and supply from scrap steel and domestic iron ore appear to have accelerated”. “After Rio Tinto’s strong performance year to date . . . we now focus on our expectation that iron ore pricing is approaching a turning point with momentum in China port inventory drawdowns slowing and supply continuing to recover. This factor, combined with a lack of meaningful valuation support, leads us to downgrade . . . Commodity price turning points are vital: Despite the high likelihood of further consensus earnings upgrades as the market factors in iron ore prices which continue to be ahead of estimates, we feel that history shows that, if commodity pricing momentum has already turned, then these earnings moves are lagging indicators of share-price performance.”Credit Suisse ● Aston Martin hit a new record low on a profit warning. The carmaker cut its full-year wholesale target from between 7,100 and 7,300 to between 6,300 and 6,500 and warned that the earnings margin before interest, tax and amortisation would be 20 per cent. Consensus forecasts had been for 7,091 units and a 23.5 per cent margin. Goldman Sachs said the guidance implied full-year ebitda of £230m, 16 per cent below its previous below-consensus forecast. Even after a capital expenditure cut, “we believe it will be challenging for Aston Martin to produce positive free cash flow”, it said.  “Aston Martin is a medium-term story and its future is unlikely to be defined by 2019’s performance. Nevertheless, concerns around operating risk (not just in the plants but in the sales and distribution network) as well as questions on Aston’s ability to sustain volumes on vehicles that are more than 12 months old are all areas of concern for investors. Today’s profit warning will add to these concerns.”Goldman Sachs ● ITV led the FTSE 100 gainers on better than feared advertising guidance. Total ad revenue was down 5 per cent, compared with previous guidance for a 6 per cent decline, and management targeted third-quarter ad revenue of between 1 per cent down and 1 per cent up. The consensus had been 1 per cent down. The reassuring ads data eclipsed mixed results from ITV, with its studios business affected by contract phasing and full-year guidance reflecting higher second-half costs.  ● Marston’s dropped after the pub group said sales had been negative in recent weeks. Weakening demand and a tough year-on-year comparison due to the 2018 World Cup and warm weather meant total managed and franchised like-for-like sales were down 2.3 per cent over the past 16 weeks, the company said. Marston’s also said it would accelerate a debt reduction strategy by deferring £70m of expansion investment that had been planned over the next three years. Sellside stories ● Berenberg downgraded Petra Diamonds from “buy” to “sell” with an 8p target price, cut from 15p. Slower debt reduction and reduced diamond prices increase the risk that Petra will need further equity financing as the miner’s $650m bond moves towards maturity in May 2022, Berenberg said. The broker was also concerned about Petra’s ability to repay its refinanced debt by the time mines reach the end of their life.  Petra’s own target of delivering up to $200m of free cash flow between 2020 and 2022 has built in a level of optimism, including $45m from rand devaluation, Berenberg said. Its own forecast for the period was for $135m in free cash flow, which would leave Petra needing to refinance $475m of debt. “Based on a life of mine to 2030, coupled with an increase in capital expenditure from 2023 as deferred capex is incurred, we do not think that Petra’s operations will generate enough cash to repay the refinanced debt principal in full, and thus we think that the likelihood of an equity raise (as part of the debt refinancing) has increased. The issue for equity holders is that, based on a 2030 life of mine for most mines, cash flow returns after debt is repaid are not compelling”Berenberg ● In brief: Adyen rated new “buy” at UBS; Asos raised to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; DIA rated new “buy” at HSBC; Forbo cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; HSBC cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Heidelberger Druck cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Lindt & Sprüngli raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux and to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Morgan Advanced raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Nexity raised to “buy” at Société Générale; Norma raised to “hold” at SocGen; Pets at Home rated new “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Prysmian raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Siemens raised to “buy” at SocGen; Swedish Match cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Trainline rated new “hold” at Peel Hunt; UBS cut to “sell” at SocGen; Whitbread cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Wincanton rated new “buy” at HSBC.

"Elliott, Fortress and the tangle over a Japanese property developer","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Japan, according to received wisdom, doesn’t do hostile takeovers.  There was a brief spate of attempts about a decade ago. They didn’t go well and everyone settled on the idea that Japan’s enormous, ripe-for-consolidation market would never evolve into a dealmaking free-for-all.  They may still be right, according to the FT’s Leo Lewis in Tokyo. But a developing scrap over the hotel and property developer Unizo at least hints at the possibility of a fundamental shift.  Unizo initially received an unsolicited takeover bid from travel agency and hotel operator HIS, then a significantly higher white knight tender offer from investment group Fortress, a unit of Japan’s SoftBank.   Now shares in the real estate company are trading higher than the level of the Fortress bid, and with good reason.  Large Unizo shareholders have told the FT there’s no way they’re selling their shares for the ¥4,000 per share Fortress is offering: This is a desirable, undervalued asset and there is high anticipation for an all-out bidding war.  And guess who has built a 9.9 per cent stake in the Japanese group and is set to win if there is a bidding war: Paul Singer’s Elliott Management.  The importance of all this, says someone that is closely involved, has to do with the digestion of the Japanese market. The metabolic rate has long been significantly slower than other major markets precisely because deals like these happened rarely.  The resulting flabbiness is what consistently limits any serious bull run on the Japanese market to a couple of years at best. Hostile offers, now seemingly tolerated, are the adrenalin shot Japan desperately needs. PS While on the topic of Japan, here’s a working link to the piece on brewer Asahi and its global dealmaking. Sorry about the mishap earlier this week!  After a 15-year wait, Goldman wants more in China Goldman Sachs has finally applied to take a controlling stake in its Chinese securities joint venture, 15 years after it first launched.  The country’s securities regulator began taking applications last year from banks looking to up their holdings in joint ventures to 51 per cent, part of a bigger initiative to open up China’s financial sector.  Nomura, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse have all applied, while UBS has already received the green light from the China Securities Regulatory Commission and launched operations with a majority stake in its Chinese business. Goldman’s application is an important step for Sino-foreign securities partnerships.  The US investment bank was the first foreign bank to ink a deal with Chinese partners to set up such a joint venture back in 2004. The original deal was struck between Henry Paulson, then chairman and chief executive of the bank, and Fang Fenglei, pictured below, one of China’s top private equity investors.   Fang has connections to some of the most powerful figures in Chinese politics, including Wang Qishan, vice-president.  Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities is also partially owned by Legend Holdings, a group founded under the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1984 that went on to buy IBM’s personal computer unit in 2005. Many industry insiders believed that Goldman’s powerful partners would ultimately hinder its ability to move to majority control. The bank’s application, if successful, will show that isn’t the case. But there are still big questions as to whether a foreign bank can succeed in the Chinese investment banking market.  Fifteen years since the start of the experiment, the banks’ foreign businesses are still small. And it’s unclear if gaining majority stakes in their Chinese operations will make much of a difference. Read the full story from DD’s Don Weinland here.  Follow the money: the fees on the Advent/Cobham deal Bankers and advisers on Advent International’s takeover of the British aerospace and defence contractor Cobham are set to pocket some £200m in fees from the £4bn deal.  Much of that fee — between £120.2m and £135.2m — will go to the likes of Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs for providing financing for the deal. The broking advisers, which include the usual suspects, stand to share up to £45.8m.  But that’s only if the deal goes through. If it has anything to do with Nadine Cobham, whose late husband Michael Cobham ran the FTSE 250 group, it won’t.  The proposed takeover of one of Britain’s oldest engineers has faced a backlash from shareholders as well as some of the country’s political establishment.  Cobham’s pioneering air-to-air refuelling technology is used on all western fast jets and is regarded by many as a national strategic asset that shouldn’t easily be handed over to a foreign buyer.  Shareholders are in a quandary: Cobham shares are 50 per cent below their 2015 peak, the group has had two rights issues and it has warned on profits five times. Still, some may want to hold out for a higher bidder.  Silchester International, Cobham’s largest shareholder which owns 11.83 per cent, has said Advent’s cash offer was too low and urged the company’s management to find alternative proposals.  It’s also unclear how Boris Johnson’s government will react to a takeover of key parts of Britain’s industrial base. But you can bet bankers on the deal will be paying close attention.  The FT’s Sylvia Pfeifer and Arash Massoudi have the full details.  Job moves Linklaters has added two partners to its investment funds practice in New York.

"Shares in major iron ore miners fall","Brazil’s Vale said it would resume operations at one of its major complexes","Shares in top iron ore producers Rio Tinto, BHP Group and Anglo American were lower on Wednesday after Brazilian group Vale said it would resume operations at one of its major mining complexes. Overnight, Brazil’s National Mining Agency authorised the partial resumption of dry processing at the mine, totalling around 5m tonnes of additional output.  “This is small . . . but it is a positive in that the regulator is presumably willing to accept evidence demonstrating safe operational performance,” said Edward Sterck, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Vale was forced to halt more than 90m tonnes of production after a waste storage dam at its Córrego do Feijão burst in January, killing more than 200 people. Vargem Grande Complex was one of the complexes impacted along with Fabrica, Brucutu and others. Mining at some of these sites has resumed operations and Vale now expects sales in 2019 to hit the middle of a 307m to 332m tonne range. Since peaking at $126 a tonne earlier this month the price of iron — the key ingredient in steelmaking — has started to drift lower. It was quoted at $115.10 on Wednesday by S&P Global Platts.  Analysts at Liberum said on Wednesday a number of recent data points indicated “the top may be in for iron ore.”  “In particular, steel inventories at traders have been unseasonally restocking, iron ore port inventory declines have stalled (actually built last week), spot steel mill profitability in China has now fallen to break-even levels and supply from scrap steel and domestic iron ore appear to have accelerated,” analyst Richard Knights said, as he downgraded recommendations on Rio, BHP and Anglo American. Shares in Rio Tinto fell 4.1 per cent to 4,627p, BHP dropped 2.9 per cent to 1,985, while Anglo American lost 3 per cent. Rio was also hit by a Credit Suisse downgrade ahead of its half year results next week. “After Rio Tinto’s strong performance year-to-date (+30 per cent), we now focus on our expectation that iron ore pricing is approaching a turning point with momentum in China port inventory drawdowns slowing and supply continuing to recover,” said analyst Sam Catalano “This factor, combined with a lack of meaningful valuation support, leads us to downgrade Rio Tinto to Underperform from neutral.”","24.07.2019"
"US company dividends now outstrip Treasury yields","Income-hungry investors could be driven into stocks just as bond markets signal danger","The dramatic decline in yields on US Treasury bonds means that investors can now get more income from dividends on S&P 500 shares than on even the longest-dated government debt, upending the traditional relationship between stocks and bonds and potentially driving more savers towards the stock market. The yield on 30-year Treasuries has this week fallen decisively below the 1.98 per cent dividend yield from US stocks. On Wednesday, the 30-year yielded 1.94 per cent. Shorter-dated Treasury bonds and notes have offered less income than dividends for some time. Apart from brief moments earlier this year and in 2016, investors have to look back to the 2008 financial crisis to find the last time dividends brought in more cash than all of the available Treasuries. “It’s a really big deal,” said Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse. “If your primary concern is steady cash to live off then the idea that you can get a better return of capital from equities is important, but also out of sync with what we have been trained over time to think is normal.” Income-seeking investors considering a plunge into the stock market face a dilemma, however.  While companies typically aim to increase their dividend each year and are loath to cut them even in times of stress, the collapse in long-term bond yields and the inversion of the yield curve — in which short-term yields are higher than long-term yields — has in the past heralded a recession. A slowdown could put dividends at risk, not to mention the danger of a big fall in share prices, which have until recently been setting record highs. As a result, a higher dividend yield is not a guarantee of outperformance by the stock market. The dividend yield for European stocks has been consistently above that of benchmark 30-year sovereign bonds in the region, yet European equities have underperformed the global stock market.  “I think the upside in equities is limited because of the uncertainty over growth and given what is going on with trade and other policy situations around the world,” said Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer for Bessemer Trust. “People would rather own 10-year Treasuries than own the stock [market] because they have much less certainty on what will drive stocks going forward.” The worsening trade war between the US and China has hit investor confidence, and a waning profit outlook for US companies increases the risk that listed groups may curtail the dividends and share buybacks that have also helped prop up share prices. Companies in the S&P 500 are on course to increase earnings per share by 2.4 per cent his year, a drop from the 7.7 per cent anticipated at the start of the year. Mr Golub said concern that the S&P 500 could fall bolsters the case for investing mainly in companies that pay the highest dividends, some of which — such as utilities companies or telecoms — are less affected by the gyrations of the broader economy.  “If you are concerned about a sharp deterioration in the stock market these companies tend to be less volatile and more defensive,” he said.","29.08.2019"
"Trade war fear deepens US yield curve inversion","Yield on 10-year Treasury furthest below three-month bills since eve of financial crisis ","The inversion of the US yield curve, a measure investors view as the surest predictor of an impending recession, on Monday became deeper than at any point since the onset of the financial crisis a decade ago, as the US-China trade war spread to the currency markets. The difference between the yield on three-month Treasury bills and the benchmark 10-year bond, which has turned negative or “inverted” before every US recession of the past 50 years, widened to minus 32 basis points at its worst, after Beijing allowed its currency to weaken against the dollar past the symbolic Rmb7 level. The renminbi move came less than a week after US President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on $300bn more of imports from China starting on September 1. On top of the currency depreciation, Beijing also said on Monday that it would halt purchases of US crops in retaliation. Fearing the economic damage from an escalation in the trade war, investors piled into the relative safety of government debt across the world, sending yields lower. T
he yield on Germany’s 30-year government debt sank to as low as minus 0.07 per cent on Monday, another record low. And the yield on the US benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to its lowest level since 2016, notching its seventh straight day of declines, the longest such streak since 2012. In late afternoon trading, its yield was down nearly 11 basis points to 1.74 per cent. Three-month bills yielded 2.00 per cent, while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield plunged almost 12 basis points to 1.59 per cent.   How market turmoil sends a recession warning  “There’s been a resetting of expectations across the globe,” said Gregory Peters, a senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income. “The US has been an island of prosperity in a sea of weakness, but that looks to be ending as the impact on the consumer side from the new tariffs is likely to be bigger than the previous ones.” The last time the US yield curve was this deeply inverted was in April 2007 when credit markets were showing the first signs of what would become a global financial crisis.  Investors are weighing whether the sharp escalation in the trade war could provoke the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy more deeply and quickly than its chairman Jay Powell had signalled at his press conference last week. Mr Powell was speaking after the Fed cut rates for the first time in a decade, a move he called a “mid-cycle adjustment” designed to protect the otherwise relatively robust US economy from deteriorating global growth and trade disruptions. Mr Trump was quick to criticise the decision and, a day later, threatened the fresh tariffs on China — a move that could weaken the US economy and increase the pressure on the Fed to cut rates further. “The market is expecting the Fed will capitulate to Mr Trump’s demands and cut rates more than the mid-cycle adjustment implies,” said Jonathan Cohn, the head of US rates strategy at Credit Suisse.
 Traders are pricing another rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in September as a certainty. According to futures data compiled by Bloomberg, there is a 65 per cent chance of a 25bp cut, and a 35 per cent chance that policymakers will agree a 50bp cut. Those odds could increase further should US markets continue to sell off, according to Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson. “The Fed is there to backstop markets,” he said. “They have put all of their cards on the table to explain that, so if equity markets continue to fall, they will continue to cut.” Why renminbi fall is the latest salvo in US-China trade war","05.08.2019"
"Swiss policymakers caught in crossfire over franc","Alpine nation faces a difficult choice — allow currency to strengthen or intervene","The adage in financial markets is ‘do not fight the central bank’. But can central banks fight the US president? The Swiss National Bank may be about to find out. Swiss policymakers are, not for the first time, stuck in the crossfire of their peers. As central banks in both the US and the eurozone shift into rate-cutting mode, the Alpine nation must choose between allowing the franc to strengthen, hurting inflation in the process, or risking the wrath of the US administration by intervening in its currency. Already, the franc is uncomfortably strong. Its status as a haven, a magnet to investors in times of stress, means it is already trading at its strongest level against the euro in two years. Rate cuts from other heavy-hitting central banks would be likely to generate even more inflows. Despite having some of the most deeply negative interest rates in the world at minus 0.75 per cent, the franc is “poised to be one of the key beneficiaries” from the global shift to rate cuts, in the words of JPMorgan analysts. Swiss policymakers could choose to put up with a strong franc, or they might cut rates further into negative territory at the next meeting in September. Another option is to follow through on their perennial threat to intervene, something the central bank last did especially heavily in the depths of the eurozone debt crisis. US president Donald Trump has sharpened his rhetoric, accusing both China and Europe of keeping their currencies “unfairly” weak. The US Treasury removed Switzerland from its currency manipulator watch list in May this year, but the country’s trade surplus with the US still makes it a prime target for the president’s ire. As JPMorgan pointed out, “Trump’s increasing vociferousness on currencies and monetary policy, . . . will preclude any franc weakening from SNB intervention.” This could be good news for any hedge funds keen to take on the SNB by buying the franc — a tactic that has failed spectacularly in the past. “The [franc is] ultimately going to prove harder . . . to systematically undermine via central bank monetary policy, if a more general ‘race to the bottom’ is afoot amid a new environment of currency wars,” said Shahab Jalinoos, a currencies strategist at Credit Suisse.","22.07.2019"
"US second-quarter earnings poised to reveal profit recession","Wall Street analysts expect first back to back drop in earnings since 2016","Wall Street analysts expect corporate reporting season — which kicks off next week — will confirm that America’s biggest public companies have entered a profit recession as they contend with slowing growth and mounting trade woes. Banks are set to take centre stage next week, with the pace of earnings reports hitting full speed over the following fortnight.  Here is a look at what analysts and investors will be watching:  Bottom-line
 With analysts predicting an earnings recession — defined as two consecutive quarters of year-on-year earnings declines — for the first time since 2016, the bottom line grabs the limelight once again.  S&P 500 companies are estimated to report an earnings fall of 2.8 per cent in the second quarter, according to data provider FactSet, following a 0.3 per cent dip in the first three months of the year.   Separately, it is worth noting, small-cap companies, those with a market capitalisation between $300m and $2bn and represented by the S&P 600, are set to fare worse than their blue-chip counterparts and report a 12 per cent EPS drop, though still an improvement on the 17 per cent fall in the first quarter, analysts at Bank of America said. Meanwhile, mid-caps are expected to report a 5 per cent year-on-year earnings fall, a modest improvement on the first three months of the year.  While analysts have been predicting an earnings recession since late last year as incoming data deteriorated, not everyone is expecting one. Patrick Palfrey, strategist at Credit Suisse, said “people have over extrapolated the deceleration in the data too far”. He expects earnings to turn up positive when including the impact of share buybacks and factoring in the historical beat rate.  Buybacks
 That brings us to share repurchases, a divisive practice that is accused, among other things, of propping up earnings by reducing the overall share count and thereby spreading out profits over a smaller portion of shares.  At a time of somewhat anaemic economic growth, buybacks are helping boost earnings. Net share buybacks are expected to contribute 2.1 percentage points to EPS growth in the second quarter, according to analysts at Credit Suisse.  US companies snapped up more than $1tn of their own stock last year, a record figure, driven by the tax overhaul, and the practice has drawn the ire of some Democrats, who have argued against what they call “corporate self-indulgence” and are looking to limit repurchases.  Margins
 Higher wages, rising input costs and strength in the US dollar are predicted to contribute to margin pressures, despite expected top-line growth. S&P 500 companies are forecast to report a 3.7 per cent increase in revenues, which would be the weakest growth since the third quarter of 2016.  Analysts expect non-financial companies to report net margins of 10.8 per cent in the second quarter, down from 11.5 per cent in the year-ago quarter, according to figures cited by BofA analysts.  “We have been highlighting risk to margins from rising input costs for companies that don’t have pricing power, as well as for labour-intensive companies and sectors amid rising wages, and we expect full-year net margins to contract to 11.2 per cent in 2019 ex-financials from 11.7 per cent in 2018,” they add. Sector breakdown
 Materials, the sector with the most sensitivity to China and the fallout from the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing, is expected to have had the toughest time in the second quarter. DuPont and Freeport-McMoRan are expected to be the biggest contributors to the sector’s earnings slump, according to FactSet. The sector is projected to report a 16 per cent year-on-year decline in earnings and a 14.9 per cent drop in revenues.  Tech is in close competition in this particular race to the bottom, with expectations for an 11.9 per cent fall in earnings and a 1.1 per cent drop in revenues.  Given the uncertain geopolitical backdrop and softening economic data, it should come as no surprise that defensive sectors like utilities and healthcare are projected to report the strongest earnings growth of 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.  Earnings call
 Some of the juiciest news is reserved for a company’s earnings call, whether that be a change in strategy or management’s outlook on industry or broader macro trends.  Washington’s multi-fronted trade war, but particularly its spat with China — a crucial part of many companies’ supply chains and a key market for certain industries — is one subject America’s C-suite is expected to address. Both sides have hiked tariffs on billions of dollars of goods, and the trade war has been partly blamed for weakening the economic outlook.  Uncertainty about the trade war and its impact on business’ spending plans and supply chains is a subject investors will play close attention to.  Any commentary on strength in the US dollar, which makes American goods more expensive to foreign buyers and hurts earnings upon conversion, will also be closely watched.

For the second quarter PageGroup said fee income rose 7.4 per cent, a slowdown from the 11.4 per cent seen in the first quarter and below an 8.9 per cent market consensus. The weakness was across all of PageGroup’s markets, with Asia-Pacific and Australasia performing worst and a slowdown in continental Europe in June causing most concern. Having left a £161m full-year consensus unchanged at the end of the first quarter, PageGroup management said pre-tax earnings would be at the low end of the £156.5m to £168.0m range. Broker estimates were therefore falling by about 3 per cent.  A 15 per cent drop in PageGroup shares “appears to be at the extreme end relative to the downgrades and factoring in low valuations”, said Morgan Stanley. “Management remains committed to return excess cash (anything above £50m) to shareholders irrespective of the direction of organic growth as working capital generation is counter cyclical.” UBS downgraded sector peer Hays from “buy” to “neutral”.   “Hays remains a best-in-class staffing company and our analysis leads us to expect best-in-class conversion margin expansion. The company is making progress towards its 2022 targets but is not immune to cyclical risks which have increased over the past six months.”UBS ● JD Wetherspoon jumped after reporting stronger than expected recent trading, with like-for-like sales up 6.9 per cent in the first 10 weeks of the current quarter.   Rising costs, in particular labour, meant the pub operator reported a 23 per cent drop in half-year profit on 6.3 per cent like-for-like sales growth. Wetherspoon also revealed that it had recently restarted a share buyback programme with £5m spent on repurchases. “This is another very strong sales performance from the company, and we note that there are no signs of weather weakness seen elsewhere in the sector. We would always consider JDW to be insulated from weather variations, given fewer outdoor areas, but note that Young’s and Greene King have reported weaker trading in recent months.”Barclays Sellside stories ● JPMorgan Cazenove started coverage of Playtech, the online gambling software provider, with an “overweight” rating and December 2020 price target of 603p. “Structurally, Playtech’s platform represents a defensible competitive advantage that we believe is practically impossible to replicate,” it said. Following a challenging 2018, Playtech’s business-to-business division appeared to have stabilised and revenue excluding Asia was “displaying an encouraging trend”, said JPMorgan. The acquisition last year of business-to-consumer gaming company Snaitech diversified Playtech both operationally and geographically, making it less risky, as well as opening up a new avenue for growth. Asian markets now account for less than 10 per cent of Playtech’s group revenue and even if the whole business were shut down the valuation multiple would increase from 7.9 times earnings to a “reasonable” 17.7 times earnings, it said. “Playtech is well placed to meet guidance for 2019, which we think will represent a trough in terms of organic growth, margin and cash flow. Beyond 2019 we expect broad-based growth across B2B and B2C. The overall business has de-risked, in our view, making the current valuation compelling.”JPMorgan ● Morgan Stanley downgraded Ashtead, the tool hire specialist, from “overweight” to “equal weight” on valuation grounds. It said Ashtead was trading at a small discount to its 15-year average valuation multiple, having risen 41 per cent in the year to date, compared with a 28 per cent gain for closest peer United Rentals. The broker’s price target rose from £24.15 to £25.25. “We continue to see Ashtead as a long-term, compelling growth story and in our view the outlook remains solid, with management commenting at the recent full-year results that industry indicators remain encouraging. Both construction and non-construction US end markets continue to be supportive, with both internal and external data pointing to good levels of growth ahead . . . While the equipment rental industry remains cyclical, Ashtead’s increased non-construction exposure should limit the volatility of earnings.”Morgan Stanley Daily newsletter

"Stocks to watch: Flutter, Qinetiq, Hastings, Pernod Ricard, Metso","Marks and Spencer’s problems are no nearer to being solved, says Peel Hunt","Tuesday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Flutter Entertainment surged to its highest level since June 2018 after the bookmaker agreed an all-share takeover of The Stars Group, its Ontario-based peer. If completed, the deal would create the world’s biggest online gambling operator with £3.8bn in annual revenue and operating profit of £1.1bn. Flutter said its shareholders would own 54.6 per cent of the combined business. Davy Stockbrokers said the proposal “represents a truly transformational deal for both the company and the industry”. “We see strong strategic merit to the transaction. It improves Flutter’s position in key growth markets, including the US, while also bolstering scale and market position in its core (more mature) end markets. Acquisitions of this kind are not without risk (we expect its integration approach to be different to its previous experience). Further, the deal would increase exposure to unregulated markets (Germany, Russia) and poker. However, simply put, it sets Flutter apart as a play on the attractive global gambling opportunity.”Davy ● Qinetiq led the FTSE 250 gainers after the defence technology group doubled the size of its US business with the purchase of sensor maker Manufacturing Techniques for $105m cash. It was Qinetiq’s fifth bolt-on deal in three years.  JPMorgan Cazenove said the purchase would grow Qinetiq’s US sales to about $300m, or just over a fifth of the group total. It estimated that the acquisition would boost Qinetiq’s earnings per share by 8 per cent in the financial year ending March 2021. Sellside stories ● Peel Hunt downgraded Marks and Spencer from “buy” to “hold” with a 200p-a-share target. A capital markets day hosted by M&S on Tuesday was “extremely downbeat on the general merchandise side and the improving food performance is very unlikely to take up the slack”, it said.  The briefing opened with what amounted to “almost a confessional” detailing how M&S’s brand was still seen as “boring and old-fashioned”, said Peel Hunt. Supply chain and availability issues remained “crippling” and the Sparks loyalty card had been a flop, both with customers and for data collection, added the broker. “It seems to us, following this baring of its soul, that the relative position is worse than when the current revolution began.” “The deep-rooted problems in clothing and home seem no nearer than ever to being solved, and management admits being 18 months behind schedule. We were stunned not to hear the words ‘social media’ used even once in a two-hour presentation on the future of a clothing brand, and we see very little to inspire under-40s to switch to M&S designs. Sparks needs relaunching and whilst food bosses report ‘a few, small, green shoots of recovery’, unfortunately we have to take our medicine and admit defeat with the buy recommendation.”Peel Hunt ● RBC Capital Markets downgraded Hastings, the car insurer, from “sector perform” to “underperform” with a 170p target price. Office for National Statistics monthly data showed UK motor insurance pricing down 0.4 per cent year on year in August and it has been flatlining since the end of the second quarter, it said.  “We do not believe investors expected this given claims inflation, which Hastings reported to be between 6 and 7 per cent. We therefore expect to see some of the pure UK motor insurance players come under pressure, as they are forced to decide between margin and volume,” said RBC. Hastings, the most exposed in the sector to any downturn in UK pricing, “will face an unavoidable dilemma — either price business above its 75-79 per cent target loss ratio, or sacrifice volume. Either way, we believe the insurer’s earnings will suffer.”  ● In brief: Acciona rated new “outperform” at RBC; BBA Aviation rated new “add” at Peel Hunt; Cranswick rated new “buy” at Goodbody; DFS Furniture cut to “neutral” at UBS; DNB cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; Hilton Food rated new “hold” at Goodbody; Masmovil raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Metso cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse and to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Pernod Ricard raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Prosus rated new “buy” at Goldman Sachs; RDI Reit raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Saras raised to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Solaria Energia rated new “outperform” at RBC; Telenor cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan.

"Best of Lex Midweek: Zurich braced for more interest rate tonic","There is no reason for Switzerland to cut borrowing costs further","Dear readers, Drinking coffee in autumn sunshine outside Sprüngli café on Zurich’s Paradeplatz, Lex this week imagined the spluttering behind the copies of leading newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung. The European Central Bank attracted a slew of angry headlines in Germany last week for its latest monetary policy loosening. Switzerland is not in the EU but its economy is tightly entwined with the bloc’s. So in the conservative, German-speaking part, angst about ECB activism runs as deep. “It’s no medicine — it’s poison,” opined the NZZ. A big fear in Zurich is that an even stronger Swiss franc will force the Swiss National Bank, which meets on Thursday, to push its main policy interest rate, already minus 0.75 per cent, deeper into negative territory. That would hit savers and further inflate asset bubbles. Even discounting a caffeine high from Sprüngli’s coffee, however, this writer cannot see why the SNB would want to cut borrowing costs further. Switzerland’s economy remains among the developed world’s best performers. Swiss stocks are up a fifth this year. Deflation is unlikely. The workforce is fully employed. True, Switzerland has adapted to negative interest rates. Germany’s Deutsche Bank has complained publicly about corrosive effects on economies. Swiss banks are already imposing them on wealthier customers, and surreptitiously increasing charges for others. In a weak European sector, the shares of UBS and Credit Suisse trade at significantly lower discounts to book value than their biggest rivals. They increasingly serve wealthy clients beyond Switzerland. The domestic risk is of a housing market collapse. But that is another reason for the SNB not to loosen policy further. Swiss banks have long lost the competitive advantage once offered by strict secrecy laws. But Switzerland is helping pioneer crypto finance — a move cautiously welcomed by Lex. Swiss stock prices, meanwhile, have been driven higher largely by those of pharmaceutical groups Novartis and Roche. That is also true for Nestlé, the world’s largest food and drinks company, which is based by Lake Geneva in west Switzerland. The latter benefits from its role as a “defensive” stock in global slowdowns, but also from a revival in growth under chief executive Mark Schneider. The strong franc has hit smaller Swiss manufacturers and international groups such as engineering group ABB, which still produce goods and services in their home market. But output of the most price-sensitive goods has long moved overseas. Sprüngli customers may tut about the franc’s strength, but Switzerland strengthens the case of economic hawks who argue a strong currency encourages industrial efficiency. A big worry of Swiss business a year ago was of a damaging clash with the EU. Brussels wants to update Switzerland’s trading arrangements, based on favourable deals drawn up at a time when the country was expected to join the bloc. The Swiss have resisted, however. Brussels threatened retaliation. It tried sanctions against the Swiss stock exchange. But as Lex predicted, the move has largely backfired, thanks to countermeasures taken by Bern against EU trading venues.  The row could, of course, re-erupt. But for now the EU has other distractions, including Brexit. Switzerland holds national elections on October 20. The word in Zurich is that support for the anti-EU Swiss People’s party, the country’s most popular group, is ebbing. The beneficiary could be the more pro-Europe, liberal FDP. That would encourage better relations with Brussels. Upcoming elections are another reason for the SNB to leave interest rates unchanged on Thursday. Most analysts agree, although Morgan Stanley has predicted a quarter percentage point cut. Pictet in Geneva is among those noting that historically the SNB has changed rates more often outside its published schedule of policy meetings.  Surprise is an important weapon for central bankers. One suggestion Lex heard in Zurich was that the SNB could even raise interest rates in the not too distant future, citing economic normalisation. That would shock financial markets. It would also raise a cheer at the Sprüngli café. Have a good rest of your week. Ralph Atkins Lex writer

"Spanish group emerges as potential Bombardier Northern Ireland buyer","Towerbrook’s Aernnova among a number of companies to have expressed interest","A specialist Spanish aircraft parts maker has emerged as a potential buyer for Bombardier’s Northern Ireland business, which was put up for sale in May. Aernnova, which is owned by private equity firm TowerBrook, manufactures wing and fuselage sections and other components for customers including Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier. It is among a number of companies that have submitted expressions of interest after reviewing an offer document, two people familiar with the process confirmed. Aernnova was unavailable for comment. TowerBrook declined to comment.  Canada’s Bombardier is selling its Northern Ireland operations, which make wings and fuselages for aircraft including the Airbus A220, as part of a wider restructuring. It is one of the province’s largest private sector employers with a local heritage dating back to the 1940s. The sale has attracted interest ranging from strategic buyers to well qualified financial suitors, according to sources close to the process. US-based Spirit AeroSystems, which has said it will look at acquisitions to diversify its business away from Boeing and its 737 Max, has been tipped as a possible buyer. GKN, the UK aerospace and automotive parts supplier, has also been cited although some doubt it would have the appetite given it is implementing a turnround of its business.  US-based Triumph Group, which had been regarded as another potential buyer, is understood not to be in the running. The company said in May it was exploring strategic alternatives for its own aerospace structures business. The Bombardier disposal is being closely watched by Airbus. Guillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive, said in May the company was looking at the impact on its operations but declined to comment further. According to analysts, the company could acquire the operations itself, move production of the A220 wings to another site in the UK or allow a third party to take over operations. Bombardier said last week that the Northern Ireland business had returned to an operating profit of $4.9m in 2018, recovering from a $33.8m loss in 2017. However, a series of exceptional costs still resulted in a pre-tax loss of $41.5m for 2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse are advising Bombardier on the disposal.","08.07.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Richemont, Restaurant Group, Daily Mail, SAP","Nationalisation risk is a reason to be wary of UK water utilities, says JPMorgan","Tuesday 15:00 BST Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse has downgraded Richemont, the Swiss owner of brands including Cartier and Dunhill, to “underperform” with a target of SFr64. “We believe the market underappreciates the amount of investment needed in all three major businesses, including jewellery,” it said. Cartier jewellery, which accounts for 54 per cent of Richemont’s group profit, has become overly reliant on just three product lines, said Credit Suisse. It said the Cartier Love, Trinity and Juste un Clou collections were launched more than four decades ago and so benefit from high gross margins on relatively low marketing spend. A major product launch over the next few months would be good news but as lead times in jewellery tend to exceed 12 months, marketing costs and working capital investment will weigh on near-term profitability, it said.  Credit Suisse also cautioned on demand, saying China’s appetite for jewellery looked to be slowing and the outlook for watch sales had not improved. The broker argued that, with not much product innovation happening in horology, the “iconic” privately owned Rolex and Patek Philippe brands were likely to outgrow the likes of Baume & Mercier and Panerai in Richemont’s portfolio. Credit Suisse argued that Richemont’s Yoox Net-a-Porter online shop was likely to be lossmaking this year and next. Yet the stock was trading in line with the wider luxury goods sector at 22 times 2019 earnings, the broker said.  ● Citigroup upgraded Restaurant Group from “sell” to “neutral” with a 115p target price. The fallout from the company’s Wagamama acquisition and the departure of its chief executive has left the stock trading at 6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, a post-financial crisis trough, so further downside should be limited, Citi said.  ● Liberum downgraded Daily Mail and General Trust from “hold” to “sell” with a 620p target price. It cited concerns that the uncertainty over Brexit and the wider political landscape would hit this year’s advertising numbers.  DMG Media, DMGT’s newspaper publishing arm, accounts for one-third of group profits with print advertising making up 29 per cent of divisional sales, Liberum said. The broker also estimated that its UK property units accounted for 10 per cent of group revenue, meaning almost a quarter of group sales were directly at risk from Brexit uncertainty.   “Our concern is an obvious one: namely that advertising revenues in DMG Media are hit both by advertisers in general deciding to hold off on committing advertising revenues and the ongoing secular weaknesses in the retail sector, which is one of the biggest advertising categories for DMG Media.”Liberum ● JPMorgan Cazenove cut Pennon and Severn Trent from “overweight” to “neutral” in a review of the UK water utilities.  The risk-reward balance has become more finely balanced following a 15 per cent outperformance for the sector in the past year, JPMorgan said. While the stocks still trade below their historic valuation multiples, regulator Ofwat has yet to finalise the terms of capital costs, which could have implications for dividend policies, the broker added. Ofwat’s draft decision on cost of capital ratios is due in July. JPMorgan warned that “a general election looks the most likely route out of the Brexit impasse, bringing to the fore the threat of nationalisation under a future Labour government”. ● In brief: Aedifica rated new “hold” at Société Générale; Bechtle cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Bushveld Minerals rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Cancom raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Cellnex cut to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; DNO cut to “hold” at Canaccord; Datagroup rated new “buy” at Berenberg; DekelOil Public upgraded to “buy” at Cantor; Gamma Communications cut to “add” at Peel Hunt; Go-Ahead cut to “hold” at HSBC; Hays cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Hurricane Energy cut to speculative “buy” at Canaccord; Manx Telecom cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; Merck KGaA cut to market perform at Bernstein; Ophir Energy downgraded to “hold” at Canaccord; ProSieben raised to “outperform” at Macquarie; Randstad cut to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; SAP cut to “hold” at HSBC and cut to “neutral” at UBS; Snam cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Sumo upgraded to “hold” at Liberum; Xing cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Zalando upgraded to “buy” at Liberum.

"Stocks to watch: BP, Stora Enso, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ryanair","Strikes during peak online shopping season would spell trouble for Royal Mail, says JPMorgan","Tuesday 13:30 GMT What’s happening ● BP led the FTSE 100 fallers as hopes of a dividend rise were dashed.  At the half-year point BP had said progress in cutting debt would be “a signal in terms of distributions and a move on the dividend later in the second half of this year”. But during BP’s third-quarter conference call, chief financial officer Brian Gilvary said debt gearing would “remain above the top-end of our target” through the year-end and only move towards the middle of the range through 2020, partly because of the timing of disposal proceeds. “As a result, we believe, a dividend hike in the fourth quarter 2019 or first quarter 2020 now seems less likely,” said Morgan Stanley.  BP’s third-quarter results surpassed forecasts with clean net income of $2.25bn, down 41 per cent year on year but ahead of a $1.73bn consensus. Kepler Cheuvreux said this difference was accounted for by its Rosneft partnership and a lower-than-guided tax rate. Figures were in line on an underlying basis, the broker said.  ● Stora Enso led Europe’s paper and packaging stocks lower after cutting profit targets to reflect deteriorating trading conditions, weaker prices and reduced sales volumes.  The Finnish group said fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax would be between €100m and €180m, well below the €218m consensus and down 61 per cent year on year at the midpoint. Analysts said the revised guidance cut full-year consensus earnings forecasts by about 8 per cent.  Sellside stories ● UBS downgraded Royal Bank of Scotland from “buy” to “neutral” with a 235p target price. RBS “is well managed and positioned well to deliver substantial dividends and buybacks”, said UBS. But it saw RBS as fairly valued given the stock’s gearing to interest rates and its valuation of 10.7 times 2020 earnings, a premium of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent to Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group.  UBS forecast that RBS can return £3.2bn of excess capital, equivalent to 11 per cent of its market value. But it cautioned that the cost of restructuring NatWest Markets, the “key sticking point” in RBS’s recent third-quarter results, was a near-term drag on cash return prospects. ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded Royal Mail from “neutral” to “underweight” with a 192p price target. Its downgrade follows a Communication Workers Union ballot of Royal Mail employees this month in which 97 per cent voted in favour of a strike.  “We believe that with most of the short-run positive Brexit news flow now behind us, focus will return to the company-specific situation and potential CWU industrial action. While the direct cost of a strike is potentially manageable, we believe the indirect costs of lower parcel volume and cost savings are likely material. That said, we do not believe making concessions to the union to avoid a strike is a sustainable strategy.”JPMorgan The mediation timetable suggests industrial action could coincide with a UK general election as well as the Black Friday sales on November 29 and its online equivalent, Cyber Monday, on December 2, said JPMorgan. The broker also noted a CWU threat to time any potential strike for maximum bargaining leverage. With cost savings from the UK Parcels, International and Letters division harder to achieve, Royal Mail was likely to deliver a £277.5m headline operating profit in the current year, below company guidance of £300m to £340m, JPMorgan forecast. ● Goodbody upgraded Ryanair from “hold” to “buy” with a €13 target as part of an UK airline sector review.  While airlines’ recent share price performance has been driven by Brexit, an improving underlying picture for the business has not been priced in, the broker said. “As such we would want to be long the sector going into a reporting season when management commentary should be much more positive on yields than of late.” Ryanair is “at a turning point” thanks to rising profitability, positive ancillary revenue growth, a rolling off of fuel hedges and the likelihood that Boeing’s grounded 737 Max will enter service before the year-end, Goodbody said.  “With the intra-European market moving into a better demand-capacity balance and with some radical surgery being seen in Ryanair’s UK, German and Spanish services over the winter . . . management will reinforce its view that yields will rise in the second-half period. Adding in the fact that last year’s fourth-quarter comparison figures are favourable and we think that the company will have enough confidence to tighten guidance towards the middle of its current €750-950m range. We think that this message will be taken well by the market.”Goodbody The broker also had “buy” recommendations on IAG, Wizz Air, while easyJet, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were all left on “hold” ratings.

"Stocks to watch: Allergan, Altran, Tesco, William Hill, Asos, Iliad","No-deal Brexit risks make Royal Mail one to avoid, says Citigroup","Tuesday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Allergan jumped to its highest level since October after AbbVie agreed to buy the Botox maker for $63bn or $188 a share, a 45 per cent premium to Monday’s closing price. Allergan shareholders will receive 0.8660 of an AbbVie share and $120.30 in cash, with the transaction expected to complete in early 2020.  “We tend to view this transaction as AbbVie specific rather than heralding a broader wave of large-cap M&A across the sector,” said Citigroup. Cantor Fitzgerald said it was “unlikely that anyone else will step in to bid for Allergan at this point”. “The acquisition comes following several years of share price underperformance, and increased pressure by investors for some kind of change at the company. While a split of the company was increasingly expected over the past year, a sale of the company was never off the table, especially given the track record of the Allergan management team and CEO in particular in maximising value via buying (and selling) companies and assets.”Citigroup An acquisition of Allergan would be good news for Nasdaq-listed Evolus, the maker of a competitor to Botox, as under Abbvie’s ownership “the aesthetics business may not be as front and centre”, said Cantor. The deal was also likely to revive takeover speculation around Perrigo, as well as putting Merck back in the spotlight as a consolidator ahead of its Keytruda cancer treatment losing patent protection in 2028, the broker said.  ● Altran of France led the Stoxx 600 gainers after Capgemini agreed a surprise €3.6bn bid for the research and development outsourcer. Its €14-per-share cash offer was equivalent to about 14 times Altran’s operating earnings and was a 30 per cent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average share price.  “Altran specialises in engineering and R&D services and the initial investor reaction seems to be questioning the rationale for such a lateral move. However, we firmly believe in the digitisation of traditional industry and this structural growth opportunity is part of the reason that companies like Dassault and Aveva trade on circa 35 times [next year’s earnings]. As things like cars become increasingly digital, we think there is a clear rationale for combining operational technology (software and product engineering) with IT (AI, Analytics, Cloud, Cyber, etc).”Credit Suisse ● Wm Morrison and Tesco were the sharpest fallers among the UK grocers after industry data pointed to a tough June for the sector and a further slowdown for the big four. Market researcher Nielsen reported 0.4 per cent total sales growth over the past four weeks, which it blamed on “promotions, events and the vagaries of the weather”, while Kantar Worldpanel reported a 0.6 per cent contraction in till roll sales for the same period. Morrison was the laggard, with sales down 3.1 per cent and a 20 basis point loss of market share, according to Kantar data. Tesco sales fell 0.6 per cent on a slightly improved market share, while J Sainsbury’s sales fell 0.2 per cent with a 5 basis point share gain. While it was the first time Sainsbury had improved its market share since December 2018, drinks sales appeared to be the driver, said Barclays.  “We are more nervous about our short-term financial estimates,” said Shore Capital. “Sentiment towards the UK supermarkets has already responded to the weakening trading data and is unlikely to more positively adjust until there is evidence of stabilisation and improvement. Over the summer months . . . it is difficult to see this happening, which is likely to mean that short-term sector performance will remain muted.” ● William Hill gained after the bookmaker said on its website that a strategic partnership with US casino operator Eldorado would apply to some Caesars casinos, as the former’s acquisition of the latter completes. Eldorado last year signed a 25-year deal giving William Hill exclusive rights to manage its US sports books and mobile sports betting. Adding Caesar’s estate would give William Hill access to 25 more casinos and add five more states that have or will soon have legalised sports betting, including the key territory of New York, said analysts. William Hill would also have an opportunity to dislodge Scientific Games as Caesar’s online gambling technology provider and may get access to the company’s database of 65m customers, equivalent to a quarter of the US adult population. “Eldorado’s agreed merger with Caesars makes William Hill’s position for US sports betting more powerful, with wider market access, boosted revenues and potential optionality on brand, database and media assets. With US sports worth 35-55 per cent of the current market cap, we would buy the shares here.”Morgan Stanley Sellside stories ● UBS downgraded Asos to “neutral” from “buy” with a £33 target price. It cited the investment required by the fashion retail website to drive sales growth. Over the past six months, Asos has made changes to pricing, promotions and stock strategy that have significantly impacted margins, UBS said. Measures to improve “newness” and make pricing more competitive should help deliver better than expected sales, “but the cost of growth doesn’t seem to be easing”, it said.  “New evidence suggests top-line growth could be underpinned by improving customer acquisition, but the cost of acquisition continues to rise as higher promotions are still being used as a recruitment tool. We are also taking a less positive view on the US as data suggests Asos is (unexpectedly) significantly repositioning price in this market via higher promotions. Upside to sales estimates is unlikely to be rewarded if driven by costlier customer acquisition, so we see less scope for positive catalysts than before.”UBS ● Berenberg downgraded Iliad, the French telecoms group, to “hold” from “buy” with a €123 target price.  Iliad shares had halved in 18 months as falling revenue in its home market led investors to lose faith in its “jam tomorrow” strategy of high capital expenditure to win market share, Berenberg said. The broker assumed Iliad would improve margins in France by gradually reducing its reliance on third-party networks, both in fixed and mobile. But “to turn more positive in the near term, we would need to have greater confidence in the French top-line outlook, driven either by the success of Iliad’s own recent initiatives and/or a more benign competitive environment”, it said.  ● Citigroup cut its target price on Royal Mail to 150p and repeated “sell” advice. Management’s three- and five-year margin targets “appear ambitious” based on the evidence in a PwC report the postal delivery group commissioned, it said. PWC’s assumption that letter volume declines would moderate by 2024 ignores the possibility that technological change may disrupt the market further, Citi said. The broker also saw the possibility of a “demand shock” rather than a steady decline in corporate volumes if, for example, the UK government switched to email for all communications.  But the greatest risk, Citi said, was the risk of a “no-deal” Brexit. PWC’s report estimated that a disorderly Brexit would result in a 15 per cent drop in letter volumes over 10 years. Citi told clients: “We remain at the bearish end of the guidance range by assuming a long-term decline in letter mail of 6 per cent. We do not believe management can hit the new profit margin targets at this level of volume decline.” ● In brief: Accsys Technologies rated new “buy” at Investec; Cairn Energy rated new “buy” at Stifel; Derwent London cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Experian cut to “neutral” at Macquarie; Finablr rated new “buy” at Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan; Great Portland cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; ITV raised to “neutral” at Macquarie; Inwit raised to “hold” at Jefferies; Orange Belgium raised to “buy” at UBS; PZ Cussons rated new “sell” at Panmure Gordon; Polymetal raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Red Electrica raised to “sector perform” at RBC; RedT cut to “hold” at Investec; Telenet cut to “neutral” at UBS.

"Bank capital in the twenty first century","Why shareholders are losing out to the “family loans” of bank funding.","Recently, we had a look at Deutsche Bank as a kind of satirical performance art. Returns for its employees remain high, despite continual disappointment for shareholders, conjuring up a world where capital is exploited at the hands of labour. Now on to Credit Suisse, which announces its results on Thursday, and appears to be aware of the investment banking trade-off between labour and capital. According to this story from the FT’s Stephen Morris last week, the bank will freeze its bonus pool for 2018 as it “seeks to balance distributions to shareholders with pay for employees”. At the same time, it will be awarding top employees “double-digit pay rises”. The straightforward comparison between employee and shareholder claims on the business is complicated by the fact the former is often paid in deferred equity. But it is also complicated by another factor: bank bonds.   Financial institutions issue subordinated bonds -- sometimes called ""bank capital"" -- that take on some characteristics of equity, and are heavily exposed to losses when banks’ assets fall in value (the word ""capital"", in this respect, relates to regulatory rules, and is only coincidentally the same word as the capital in ""global capital"").  While shareholders at European banks have suffered, investors in these bonds have been making extremely high returns. For example, a $2.5bn Credit Suisse bond issued in 2014 has returned 30 per cent over the past four years, while another $2.25bn issue a year earlier has returned 34 per cent. Over the same period, equity has returned minus 41 per cent.  Operationally equivalent to a family loan In the simplest possible terms, bank capital bonds are like loans from your family that help you purchase a house. If you borrow 60 per cent of the house’s value from the bank, 30 per cent from your family, and provide 10 per cent yourself, you can weather severe losses if your family let you write off the loan. If you borrow the full 90 per cent from the bank, you’re in a much less stable position. From the regulatory perspective, bank capital is like the family loan. It isn’t quite as safe as if you’d put down a 40 per cent deposit, but it’s better than nothing. It effectively reduces “leverage”, or mitigates its implications. Bank regulators permit banks to meet more stringent post-crisis capital ratios using these bonds as well as equity. Hence, while equity counts as “tier 1 capital”, these bonds count as “additional tier 1 capital” (or AT1 - they are also called Contingent Capital, or CoCos, because they are written off if capital ratios fall below a certain level). To compensate investors, the coupon on these bonds is high — usually around 6 to 7 per cent. In the same way that high employee costs can be framed as a barrier to returns on equity, so can the high costs of paying coupons to AT1 investors. This is ultimately a cost involved in complying with a post-crisis regulatory regime, which has transferred returns from equity to returns on a kind of debt. This is an uneven transfer, because the book value (and market value) of equity at Credit Suisse is much larger than its outstanding AT1 debt.  There is another way of understanding this, though, which hinges on the word debt. The point of bank capital is that it takes on some of the characteristics of equity. If you introduce a claim on the business that has the characteristics of equity, is it surprising that equity itself underperforms? While AT1 bonds, being bonds, have a fixed upside, that upside is high enough to look like an equity upside, especially if expectations for equity are adjusted for the constraints of a post-crisis European banking sector. Imagine, by analogy, that your family give you a loan for your house, but charge a high interest rate (they don't normally do this, but imagine if they did). You tolerate the high rate because of the expected generosity they will show you if the housing market collapses. You can imagine a scenario in which your family end up capturing the eventual equity gains on the sale of the house (if, say, you go into unsecured debt to service the interest). It is now even less clear that investment banks are performing terribly. From the perspective of the 1,000 Deutsche Bank employees that earn over 1m a year, things are going well. From the perspective of the owners of regulatory capital-like bonds at Credit Suisse, things are going well. From the perspective of equity investors at both, things are going badly -- except for those investors that rotated into AT1. Not all global capital is being exploited by labour at investment banks. Labour and regulatory debt might be seen as neutral costs that passively appear on the financial statements, and should therefore not be conceptually incorporated into any holistic notion of success. But equity is simply a mechanism that allocates resources in a particular way, on behalf of particular groups. It is competing with other allocative mechanisms that similarly strain to maximise their own advantages. At banks, it is losing that competition.

"Investors roll out red carpet for debut Victoria bond","Aim-listed group’s previous attempt to tap markets in November fell through","Victoria, a supplier of red carpets to the British Royal family, has taken advantage of a debt market rally to issue a debut junk bond — at the second time of asking. The Aim-listed flooring company on Friday borrowed €330m for five years at a yield of 5.25 per cent and plans to repay its existing bank loans with the proceeds. The offering was met with more than €1bn of orders. The deal represents a scaled-back version of Victoria’s previous efforts at a bond-market debut. Last November, in a choppier market environment, the supplier for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding pulled the rug from under a €450m offering after investors demanded higher yields.  The success of the offering, this time around, demonstrates that a global shift to greater central bank support for bond markets is helping to pique fund managers’ appetites for ever-riskier debt. “The single biggest issue was that the bond market was extremely weak. That’s not the case now,” said executive chairman Geoffrey Wilding. “The bond market’s the right place for Victoria to obtain financing,” he added. One analyst said that November’s bond deal “went down like a cold cup of sick,” and that the market “took fright” because it was badly communicated.  He added that the business of the Kidderminster-based borrower is cyclical and that the company is relatively highly levered. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were £96m in the year to March 2019, while net debt stood at £340m. Victoria has sought to allay concerns over its borrowing. “There is no such absolute measure as ‘too much leverage’,” the company said in its preliminary results for 2019. “We have been surprised by how simplistic …some commentators’ thinking is.” Comparing the absolute debt levels of different businesses is “a bit like saying everyone who weighs 90kg is fat,” the company added. “That might be true of a 1.6m tall pastry chef, it probably isn’t true of a 1.9m rugby player.” Victoria’s share price has stabilised after a difficult 2018. It is up 14 per cent so far this year after dropping 44 per cent last year. Mr Wilding, a former Goldman Sachs banker, took on the role of chairman in 2012. He was previously the chief executive of New Zealand business CommSoft that faced difficulties when the dotcom bubble burst. Since 2012, the market capitalisation of Victoria has gone from £15m to more than £660m. Credit Suisse, NatWest, ING, HSBC, Bank of Ireland and BBVA managed the bond deal.","22.07.2019"
"EU fines five banks €1bn over foreign exchange cartel","Traders at RBS, Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan and MUFG used chat rooms to rig forex spot trading","Barclays, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan and Japan’s MUFG have been fined more than €1bn by the EU’s competition watchdog for rigging the multitrillion-dollar foreign exchange market after the last financial crash. The conclusion of the five-year European investigation into benchmark currency rate manipulation is the latest in a scandal that shocked the banking industry when allegations first surfaced in 2013. Since then, more than a dozen financial institutions have paid almost $12bn in fines around the world. The EU probe identified two separate cartels of traders — dubbed the “Three Way Banana Split” and “Essex Express” — that used online chat rooms to share information about customers’ orders, prices and other trading activities in order to manipulate the spot currency markets. Most of the traders knew each other on a personal basis, according to the European Commission, also using other chat rooms such as the “Semi-Grumpy Old Men”. Citigroup was hit with the biggest fine of €311m, followed by RBS with €249m, JPMorgan at €229m, Barclays at €210m and MUFG with €70m. UBS also participated but avoided a €285m fine as it was the first to alert the EU to the cartels. The other banks settled the charges, and all but MUFG also applied for leniency which reduced fines by between 10 and 50 per cent.  The decision will clear the way for civil suits in the region, with law firm Scott and Scott poised to launch the European leg of a US class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $2.3bn settlement with 15 banks.  These cartel decisions send a clear message that the commission will not tolerate collusive behaviour in any sector of the financial marketsMargrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner The market-rigging activity took place between 2007 and 2013, and involved 11 currencies, including the euro, pound and dollar. The information shared by traders “enabled them to make informed market decisions on whether to sell or buy the currencies they had in their portfolios and when. Occasionally, these information exchanges also allowed the traders to identify opportunities for co-ordination,” said the EU. The EU said there was another investigation involving Credit Suisse, regarding “an alleged infringement which may have taken place in another chatroom” but it declined to provide any further details.  Credit Suisse said it “does not believe that its employees engaged in any conduct in the FX markets which violated the European Union’s competition rules”. It added that it was co-operating with the EU investigation “but intends to vigorously contest the substance of the allegations”. “Foreign exchange spot-trading activities are one of the largest markets in the world, worth billions of euros every day,” said Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner. “These cartel decisions send a clear message that the commission will not tolerate collusive behaviour in any sector of the financial markets.” JPMorgan said: “We are pleased to resolve this historical matter, which relates to the conduct of one former employee. We have since made significant control improvements.”  Barclays declined to comment. The British bank took a £240m provision related to the forex probe at the end of 2017, according to a filing. RBS acknowledged the conclusion of the investigation and said its €249m fine was “fully covered by existing provisions”. It added that it was co-operating with other unnamed authorities on further, similar probes into past misconduct in currency trading and could face more “material” penalties and consequences. Lawyers for investors in the US civil case have been waiting for the ruling to launch the European leg of claims. David Scott, managing partner of Scott and Scott, the co-lead on the US class-action claim, said European investors remained uncompensated. Belinda Hollway, a Scott and Scott partner, said: “We’ve been waiting for this step before initiating a recovery action. Our firm will be working to recoup losses suffered by non-US pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies and multinational corporations, among others, as a result of the banks’ wrongdoing.”  In December, law firm Quinn Emanuel filed a claim for damages in London in a 200-page document against RBS, UBS, HSBC, Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan, alleging that they manipulated the currencies markets, according to Boris Bronfentrinker, a partner at the law firm.

"FTSE 100 groups cut back on cash pots for tax disputes","Blue-chip companies set aside £1bn less in past year to cover liabilities","FTSE 100 companies put aside almost £1bn less last year to cope with potential tax disputes after a spike stemming from a UK authority clampdown on multinational tax avoidance.  The UK’s largest companies put aside £4.5bn to cover tax disputes in the most recent financial year, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.  It represents a drop on the £5.2bn set aside in 2017-18 after corporates more than doubled their provision for disputes year on year. Lawyers said the fall could reflect a slowdown in disputes over the so-called “Google tax” designed to prevent companies avoiding liabilities by relisting UK profits in other jurisdictions via overseas subsidiaries.  The diverted profits tax was introduced in 2015, triggering a rash of disputes which have in many cases taken several years to resolve, according to government data.  In the years immediately after its introduction multinationals set aside millions to deal with disputes stemming from transfer-pricing rules, including large drug companies AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline.  In 2015 AstraZeneca set aside $357m for such disputes, falling to $184m in 2016. In 2017 it set aside just $30m. GSK has also set aside a decreasing pot of cash to cope with disputes, according to its annual report.  In February, FTSE 100 miner Glencore revealed that it had been hit with a $680m tax demand from the UK government over transfer pricing which it pledged to fight, covering profits earned between 2008 and 2017.  “Some of the biggest tax disputes [in recent years] have now been worked through the system,” said Jason Collins, partner at Pinsent Masons. “The slowdown could also be due to companies feeling more chipper about their prospects to win against tax authorities than in the past.”  According to Thomson Reuters, companies have also faced more intervention in recent years from international tax authorities, including in emerging market countries such as Brazil, Bangladesh and India. Last year mining group BHP said it could face a $1.4bn bill for underpaying a social contribution tax in Brazil on top of a further $1.1bn for incorrectly calculating corporation tax.  Raichel Hopkinson, head of practical law dispute resolution at Thomson Reuters, said: “The rapid growth rate of developing countries can mean that governments are under pressure to raise revenues for public services and infrastructure spending, which can result in a more aggressive approach to enforcing tax laws. “Tax authorities are taking an increasingly aggressive stance towards potential underpayment by businesses and are more willing to open lengthy investigations and issue penalties for individual infractions that can run into hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars.” Recent wins by the UK’s tax authority included a £239m Credit Suisse case and a Supreme Court ruling in March over unpaid tax on £5bn of Lehman Brothers assets after the bank’s collapse in 2008. This article has been amended to clarify that the Supreme Court ruling related to Lehman Brothers’ assets and to correct Raichel Hopkinson’s title.

"Stocks to watch: Rolls-Royce, Sirius Minerals, Moncler, Burberry","Computacenter’s stuttering US business holds back earnings prospects, says Berenberg","Tuesday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Rolls-Royce was the FTSE 100’s sharpest faller after interim results from the jet engine maker revived longstanding concerns about its cash conversion.  Rolls reported a worse than expected core free cash outflow of £391m on growing inventories, repair costs and compensation for problems with its Trent 1000 turbine. Management repeated guidance, including a target of delivering £700m of free cash flow by the year end that analysts said was increasingly looking a stretch. JPMorgan Cazenove highlighted that Rolls’ first-half cash had been bolstered by about £300m of deposits from large defence industry orders, which tend to arrive erratically. The broker also questioned management’s 2020 target of £1bn in free cash flow, saying that between 50 and 70 per cent of the amount appeared to come from working capital inflows such as prepayments on long-term service agreements. Stripping out the oversized working capital benefit suggested consensus core earnings forecasts were about 10 per cent too high for 2020 and probably 2021 too, it said. ● InterContinental Hotels dropped after an unexpected weakening in room rates overshadowed in-line results from the hotelier. A tougher US market meant revenue per available room, or revpar, the industry’s favoured metric, was down 0.2 per cent in the second quarter compared with consensus forecasts for a 0.9 per cent improvement.  RBC Capital Markets repeated an “underperform” rating. “IHG has been our best performing hotels stock this year, rising 28 per cent despite limited revpar movement. The group generates 60 per cent of income from the US, where new supply is just 1.9 per cent and occupancy is at peak levels, suggesting limited upside potential. China is weak, given excess supply and a slowing economy, and the group is also suffering in Europe. As a result, it is unclear where a positive catalyst could come from.”RBC ● Sirius Minerals hit a four-year low after the fertiliser mine developer suspended a $500m junk bond issue due to price this week, blaming market conditions. A $3bn financing package hangs on completion of the bond issue and Sirius has said it has available liquidity at the current pace of investment to last until the end of September. If Sirius is forced to go into cash-protection mode, it would have consequences for the project schedule and ultimate valuation, said JPMorgan. “We believe there is an elevated risk profile evident for equity-holders until completion of the high-yield tranche, given shareholders are, in essence, shouldering the full burden of project financing risk . . . The market will now inevitably price in an alternative funding scenario, which could include an additional equity call.”JPMorgan ● Vivendi surged on news that Tencent of China was in talks about buying 10 per cent of the group’s Universal Music division, the world’s largest music company, with a 12-month option to double the stake in a deal that would value the division at €30bn. Vivendi has been exploring a sale of up to half of Universal Music since 2018. “Based on Vivendi’s current market cap, the €30bn valuation of Universal Music and the market value of listed stakes implies a negative value for the remaining assets, including Canal+ and Havas,” said Goldman Sachs. It estimated a sum-of-the-parts value per share of €33.20 for Vivendi if the deal completes. Other brokers wanted more detail on what Tencent gained by becoming a minority shareholder of Universal Music, and how much Vivendi was giving away both on future Chinese growth prospects and further monetisation options. “On the one hand, this deal goes some way to confirming a relatively high value for Universal Music — which sceptics did not believe. That is a clear positive to us. On the other hand, 10 per cent is a relatively low proportion, we do not see exactly why Tencent would go to 20 per c after a year if they haven’t now, and it is not clear to us who else would be interested in a stake at this valuation.”Barclays Sellside stories ● Bernstein Research downgraded Burberry and Prada to “underperform” as part of a luxury goods sector review that sought shelter from growing trade tensions by “moving to quality street”. LVMH, 
Moncler and Gucci owner Kering were all upgraded to “outperform”.  “The prospects for global luxury goods demand seem to be weakening, as the USA administration escalates the international trade war confrontation with China, while Chinese consumer trends reach a plateau. We believe it may be appropriate to increase exposure to high quality and high positive momentum names, while reducing exposure and putting self-help stories on pause.”Bernstein Consumers concentrate their purchases on a smaller number of brands in a slowdown, which may damage the turnaround stocks, Bernstein said. Recent updates from Burberry and Prada were improved rather than earth-shattering and the share price response may have gone ahead of organic growth performance, said the broker. It saw investor expectations of Burberry’s recovery accelerating in the second half as “a tall order”, particularly as any last-minute Brexit agreement would cause material currency headwinds. The recent market turmoil had opened up opportunities to switch into LVMH and Moncler, which were the sector’s top picks on earnings quality and momentum, Bernstein said. On Kering, the broker argued that recent weak numbers from Gucci in North America were likely to be “a consequence of the blackface faux pas at the beginning of the year. Gucci has decided to keep a low profile in 2019, waiting for American consumers to forget the incident.” While questions remain about the longevity of Gucci, renewed spending in the second half should be enough to provide a reassuring short-term sales recovery, Bernstein said.  ● Berenberg downgraded Computacenter, the IT support outsourcer from “buy” to “hold”, with a £15 target.  Computacenter’s 45 per cent gain for the stock in the year to date had matched listed peers such as Bechtle, Cancom and Softcat, Berenberg said. However, while Computacenter’s first-half performance in the UK and Germany had topped expectations, the recently acquired US business, FusionStorm, had been underperforming.  “We had expected the US business to be a significant driver of upgrades, which are now unlikely. Furthermore, first-half results are likely to be muted (particularly on organic growth) and we do not expect a cash return until late 2020. We therefore feel there will be a better entry point for new buyers.”Berenberg ● In brief: AB InBev cut to “neutral” at UBS; Air France-KLM raised to “market Perform” at Bernstein; Air Liquide raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; BHP cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Brunello Cucinelli raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Carel raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Cobham cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Direct Line cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Europcar raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Eutelsat cut to “hold” at HSBC; Ferrexpo cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; FinecoBank raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Guala Closures rated new “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; IMI cut to “hold” at HSBC; Inmarsat cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Lonza rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Puma raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Ryanair cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Securitas cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Siemens Gamesa raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; SolGold rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Spectris raised to “buy” at HSBC and cut to “sell” at Berenberg.

"What Anglo American’s ‘one-off’ buyback reveals about commodities","Miner exercises caution as standout performing metals look unlikely to push higher","When Anglo American reported its best half-year results since 2011 last week, the London-listed miner had a surprise for investors: a $1bn share buyback. However, the news was quickly tempered by the realisation that the repurchase programme — announced alongside a $800m interim dividend — was a “one off”. “In terms of capital allocation, is it sustainable? Well, no. It’s a one-off . . . until such time as we accumulate more cash,” said Anglo’s finance director Stephen Pearce. “[It’s] very much an ‘earn it before we think about it’ policy.” So what does Anglo’s reluctance to commit to further buybacks say about the outlook for commodity markets and prices?  Two commodities — steelmaking ingredient iron ore and palladium, a metal used to reduce harmful emissions in cars with petrol engines — were the standout performers as Anglo reported a 19 per cent increase in underlying earnings to $5.5bn in the six months to June. Iron ore has enjoyed an extraordinary run this year, with the price hitting triple digits for the first time since 2014 on supply disruptions in Australia and Brazil, and record Chinese steel production.  Palladium, meanwhile, has continued a barnstorming rally with the metal jumping 80 per cent in the past 12 months to a record high of $1,600 a troy ounce, because of tepid supply growth and strong demand. 
 In both cases there are reasons for thinking that prices are unlikely to push higher — and in the case of iron ore could even suffer a reversal. Since reaching a five-year high above $125 a tonne earlier this month, the price of iron ore has fallen back to $118
 as a number of closely followed indicators have started to flash red. The pace of stock declines at Chinese ports has started to slow in recent weeks, a signal that supply is starting to recover from problems earlier this year, according to analysts. On top of that, there has been an increase in Chinese steel inventories, an indication that output could slow in the second half of the year. “Iron ore pricing is approaching a turning point,” said analysts at Credit Suisse in a recent report.  Palladium has also pulled back from its high but is unlikely to suffer a big correction because fundamentals remain so strong. The introduction of new vehicle emissions standards means that demand is still robust, while years of deficits have drained the market of stock. “Palladium lacks inventories and (petrol-based) demand is rising,” said analysts at Macquarie.  So what of Anglo’s other key commodities? It is difficult to see copper trading much above $6,000 a tonne unless there is a breakthrough in the US-China trade dispute, while the diamond market is struggling with a glut of polished stone and stagnant demand. That leaves coking coal, which has been another beneficiary of record-breaking Chinese steel production.  Add in ever-present concerns about slowing global growth and Anglo’s caution in committing to further buybacks is understandable if disappointing for analysts and investors.","30.07.2019"
"‘Green bond’ market leaves wildlife behind","Energy, housing and transport projects dominate over natural habitats","Late last year Seychelles issued the world’s first government bond dedicated to marine conservation — a so-called “blue bond,” aimed at supporting sustainable fisheries.  But an initial round of congratulations soon gave way to nagging questions among investors: why was the issuance so small, at $15m, and why had it taken so long?  Capital-markets instruments designed to improve the natural environment are now more than a decade old. The World Bank issued the first “green” bonds in 2008, and the market has since grown steadily, expected to top $250bn in issuance by the end of 2019, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative. But amid all this accelerating activity, the planet’s wildlife — on land and in the oceans — has been mostly left behind. Classifications vary, but estimates suggest that a mere 5 to 10 per cent of green-bond proceeds have gone towards funding biodiversity conservation projects, as the vast majority flows in to energy, buildings, and transport. Much of the money coming in to the conservation sector still comes from public funds, resulting in an annual funding shortfall of about 85 per cent, according to McKinsey and Credit Suisse. “Conservation market mechanisms are nowhere near their potential,” says Bikram Chaudhury, chief executive at Singapore-based GreenArc Capital, and a former managing director at Credit Suisse. Conservation is “globally undercapitalised and unlinked to true markets”.  Analysts point to a number of factors holding back the development of the market. Chief among them: a lack of investment-ready projects that offer meaningful deal sizes for investors to justify the costs of due diligence. “The lack of a project pipeline is an important barrier we face”, says Katherine Stodulka, programme director at the Blended Finance Taskforce, a London-based group that tries to fund projects through a combination of private and concessional capital, such as grants or interest-free loans. “It is no accident that renewable energy has been more easily investable . . . given the sheer number of projects and the predictable revenue streams they generate.” Even when projects are under way, they can have unpredictable cash flows at first. A game reserve, for instance, may take years to restore wildlife populations before they become attractive to tourists. The Tropical Landscapes Finance Facility is one example of a “blended” initiative, with a target of $1bn in long-term loans to landowners to protect endangered species in Indonesia. Donor-based capital is used to finance early-stage development costs and technical assistance through a $100m grant fund, according to the task force. Once projects reach maturity and generate steady cash flows, these are securitised and sold as notes to private investors.  Such financing structures can “begin to create that investment mindset” in sectors “which are traditionally seen as aid-based,” said Ms Stodulka. Another problem is the regulatory vacuum in which most conservation finance projects operate. There is little by way of common standards co-ordinated and enforced by national and international bodies.  “The fact that 5 to 10 per cent of conservation is being funded through the market is, in itself, incredible,” says Gabriel Eickhoff, chief executive of Lestari Capital, a Singapore-based conservation investor with $10m in assets. “If those sectors were properly regulated and systematised and leveraged by true markets rather than by people simply wanting to do good, the potential is endless.” Mr Eickhoff notes that carbon trading, for example, now has a set of common measures, spearheaded by the EU, that have resulted in a deep and liquid market for offsets. But measuring conservation outcomes is more difficult: while carbon avoided in one part of the world can be counted against emissions elsewhere, the value of protecting plants and animals can be hard to quantify and compare, let alone trade on exchange platforms. However, efforts are under way to capture the value of nature. “Because [valuing nature] is so complex, people turn away from it”, says Mark Gough, chief executive of the Natural Capital Coalition, a London-based body working to create a unified system to value ecosystems. “But with evidence and collaboration, it can absolutely be done,” he said. In the meantime, the lack of a developed, regulated market has hurt pioneering efforts — including the Seychelles blue bond. An individual involved in structuring these deals said the “long, complex” set-up process can be traced to a tangle of over two dozen implementing bodies, financial institutions, international bodies and governments that needed to be involved, in the absence of established players and standards.  Even if markets had reliable methods to financially value and trade natural capital, the principle remains controversial. George Monbiot, an outspoken critic of market-based conservation, has called the idea “morally wrong, intellectually vacuous, emotionally alienating and self-defeating.” He insists that “intrinsic values” should be enough to justify protection.  But Mr Eikhoff disagrees, noting that human beings have always tried to “commoditise” nature, from extracting minerals to building houses from wood.  “Once we connect markets, we can actually fund the correction of the harms caused by all that commodity production,” he says. “While I accept the precautionary principle, I say ‘don’t stop it, improve it’”.","21.06.2019"
"China’s Huatai looks to raise as much as $2bn in London listing","Brokerage to become first group to list in London as part of new link between UK and China","Brokerage Huatai Securities said on Tuesday it seeks to raise as much as $2bn when it becomes the first Chinese company to list in London as part of a new link between the two market centres.  The Nanjing-based company, one of the biggest brokerages in China, said on Tuesday each global depositary receipt be priced between $20 and $24.5. The offer period is set to begin on Tuesday and will end on Friday, with a maximum 82.5m GDRs up for grabs.  Including the full exercise of the overallotment option, the sale is expected to raise between $1.7bn and $2.02bn and the number of GDRs will represent about 10 per cent of the company’s outstanding share capital. The sale will make the financial group the first company to take advantage of a link between the London Stock Exchange and a Chinese bourse. The offer price and number of GDRs to be sold will be determined on or around June 14, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, with “conditional dealings” in London expected to begin on or around June 17. JPMorgan, Huatai Financial Holdings in Hong Kong, and Morgan Stanley are the joint global co-ordinators and bookrunners of the sale. HSBC Bank and Credit Suisse are also involved. “Huatai will offer international investors exposure to China’s financial services market, which has grown strongly as personal wealth has rapidly accumulated and capital markets have developed,” said Zhou Yi, chairman and president of the brokerage. The GDRs are expected to list on the standard part of the LSE and to trade on the Shanghai-London Stock Connect segment of the main market. Trade is expected to begin on or around June 20.","11.06.2019"
"Stocks to watch: M&G, Prudential, Experian, Hunting, Sabadell","Weak auto production could force Bodycote to cut 2019 targets, says HSBC","Wednesday 11:00 BST Sellside stories ● Deutsche Bank, Barclays and JPMorgan Cazenove all put positive ratings on M&G following the European asset manager’s demerger from Prudential earlier this week. M&G fell sharply on Tuesday in anticipation of a share placing on behalf of Prudential shareholders that was completed at 205p apiece.  Ahead of this week’s split Deutsche worried that M&G had an “unproven” investment case “with not much growth and too much debt”. However, “while the business outlook might be unexciting, the share price offers surprisingly compelling value”. Investors should receive almost 17 per cent in dividends alone over the next 18 months, which may be supplemented by some re-rating of the share price as the flowback from Prudential shareholders starts to ease. “For instance, if the yield were merely to match that of its closest peer, it would imply a further 18 per cent upside, giving a realistic 35 per cent total return over the period,” Deutsche said. JPMorgan gave M&G an “overweight” rating and 271p-a-share target price. “The key attraction at M&G . . . is its cash flow profile from asset management, with-profits and annuities businesses. We note that, on top of earnings, we expect M&G to release capital backing the annuities business, which is in run-off. This provides a strong cushion to the dividend.”JPMorgan Dividends are covered 1.5 times by cash, based on management guidance, so the remainder could be used for bolt-on acquisitions or debt reduction, JPMorgan said.  Growth was the big problem, with no guarantees that expansion via M&G’s PruFund range of funds and its third-party management deals would be sufficient to outperform the life business run-off, JPMorgan said. But with the price already reflecting the likelihood of negative fund flows, the chance of growth from asset management was “a free option with the stock”, it said. Barclays set a 256p target on M&G and gave it an “overweight” rating. The stock deserved to trade at 7 per cent dividend yield, in line with closed-book insurers rather than asset managers, Barclays said. M&G was likely to deliver a “safe, static” yield over the next three years but its asset management division was likely to continue to see outflows until 2022 — and PruFunds, while an “excellent product offering”, only generated 5 per cent of earnings, it said. The path to a re-rating “may be choppy as we expect pretty much a full recycling in M&G’s shareholder base (away from that of Prudential’s)”, Barclays said. “We believe the stock should screen well with income investors, which should over time replace the growth-biased investors interested in the Pru Asia story.” Morgan Stanley, the only mainstream broker so far not to advise buying M&G shares, kept an “equal weight” rating but said its shares were “oversold” versus its 245p price target.  ● Deutsche Bank downgraded Prudential from “buy” to “hold” with a £14.50 price target. Its move was on valuation grounds and unchanged forecasts. “Though we see the potential for attractive long-term growth in the group’s Asian business, we estimate the continuing group has effectively re-rated by 15 per cent in the two days since the demerger,” Deutsche said. ● HSBC downgraded engineer Bodycote from “buy” to “hold” with a target price cut to 725p. “Against our expectation, the outlook for manufacturing appears to be getting worse rather than stabilising,” it said. Rather than strong services demand helping to stabilise weak manufacturing, the services side of the group “seems to have cracked” and manufacturing has continued to deteriorate, HSBC said. “The data is not conclusive, but visibility has gone from bad to worse, which leads us to conclude the risks at Bodycote are to the downside. We think the next news from the company will be a downgrade to full-year 2019 expectations and a weak, or at least cautious, 2020 outlook.” Light vehicle production estimates have been falling yet the consensus still expects Bodycote to increase second-half revenues by 2.5 per cent at constant currencies, HSBC said. Investors also expect Bodycote to improve margins even though its operating leverage is higher when revenues turn negative, the broker said. Nevertheless, an 18 per cent fall in the stock over the past six months was probably enough given Bodycote could defend cash flow by pausing investment and waiting for an upturn, HSBC added. “More importantly, Bodycote is a cyclical growth story — [sales] mix improvements should mean it is faster growing and more profitable when the cycle turns for the better,” HSBC said.

"Stocks to watch: Morrisons, Sirius, Whitbread, Gulf Keystone","Sainsbury’s is in recovery but its bank will keep needing capital injections, says UBS","Tuesday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Wm Morrison led the UK supermarkets lower after August industry data suggested it had delivered the weakest sales among the big four operators.  Morrisons’ sales were down 1.8 per cent for the 12-week period ending September 7 compared with overall market growth of 0.9 per cent, Nielsen data showed. Sainsbury’s sales were flat for the period while Tesco and Asda fell 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively as the Aldi and Lidl discount chains continued to take market share.  “As [year-on-year] comparatives ease further over coming months we could see better growth, especially if we see some Brexit stockpiling. However, the same old problem remains for the big four — the discounters continue to eat most of the growth in the industry.”HSBC ● Sirius Minerals more than halved after the company scrapped a $500m junk bond issue that was the key plank in its financing package for a fertiliser mine in the North York Moors. Blaming market conditions for the failure, Sirius said it would slow the pace of development to save remaining cash during a six-month strategic review. Analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove, which had made a $2.5bn credit facility available to Sirius contingent on the bond sale, called it a “significant negative for equity ownership”. Investors “will clearly price in either further equity calls from investors” as well as a possible part sale of the project at a discount to book value, JPMorgan said. The broker also cautioned that assumptions underpinning project valuations, such as estimated first production and operating costs, were no longer applicable. Sellside stories ● UBS upgraded J Sainsbury from “neutral” to “buy” with a 240p-a-share price target.  “In the face of negative like-for-like [sales] driving margin contraction and plans to reinvest into the business to re-establish competitiveness, the market lost confidence in the equity story,” UBS said. “These concerns, however, are overdone in our view.” A UBS survey pointed to shopper perception of the brand recovering, which led the bank to expect like-for-like sales to stabilise by the Christmas quarter.  Stable sales “in tandem with tangible cost savings opportunity” should be sufficient to support a midterm earnings margin for Sainsbury’s core business of 2.3 per cent rather than the 2.1 per cent margin implied by the share price, UBS said. Nevertheless, UBS cut earnings forecasts for Sainsbury’s to reflect weaker returns from its bank. Competition in mortgage lending, higher capital consumption and a deposit franchise with a competitive disadvantage meant Sainsbury Financial Services would keep needing capital injections, which were a 20p-a-share drag on the current enterprise value, the broker estimated. ● Jefferies started coverage of InterContinental Hotels, Park Plaza owner PPHE and Accor with “buy” ratings.  Revenue per available room (revpar) — the lodging industry’s key metric — was “being driven by price increases rather than occupancy, a sign that the cycle is losing momentum”, said Jefferies. Nevertheless, revpar only turns negative when there is a sharp deceleration in GDP growth and the current global outlook does not justify taking such a negative view, the broker added.  Hotel operators that own their properties are much more exposed to moves in revpar than those that manage or franchise, so their sector discount should be deeper in the cycle’s late stages, Jefferies said. It set price targets of £62 and £22 on InterContinental and PPHE, with a €52 target on Accor.  InterContinental looks cheap after a disappointing first half of the year and has scope to pay special dividends by 2021 worth about 10 per cent of its market value, Jefferies said. Accor can re-rate on its “ongoing shift towards a more cash generative, asset-light business model” while PPHE offers “hidden value” that should narrow on improving investor awareness and progress with developments such as the Art’otel London Hoxton, it said. Whitbread, the Premier Inn owner, was given a “hold” rating and £45 target. Whitbread cited Brexit uncertainty, a lack of short-term catalysts and a long path before German expansion makes any meaningful contribution to the group.  ● Macquarie started coverage of Iraq explorer Gulf Keystone Petroleum with an “outperform” recommendation and 315p price target.  Cash from Gulf Keystone’s 80-per-cent-operated Shaikan field in Kurdistan has transformed the company’s balance sheet while regular payments from the Kurdistan Regional Government since 2015 should provide the confidence to invest in the infrastructure needed to support a long-term target of trebling production, said Macquarie. “We flag that Shaikan production has been largely uninterrupted, even at the height of the regional conflict with Isis. In addition, at times strained relationships between the governments in [Kurdistan’s capital] Erbil and Baghdad have not resulted in any operational issues for Gulf Keystone.” Having cleared out its boardroom in 2014 and 2015, Gulf Keystone has “a high quality management in place and we believe any lingering perceptions around the previous team and culture should be dismissed”, Macquarie added.

"Stocks to watch: Sophos, Avast, Ocado, Boohoo, Rolls-Royce, SSE","Jefferies raises red flags over NMC Health’s earnings quality","Monday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Sophos led the UK software stocks higher after Thoma Bravo 
agreed to buy the security specialist for £3.1bn including net debt. The US private equity group offered $7.40 in cash for each Sophos share, a premium of 37 per cent to the company’s closing price on Friday. The total purchase price was equivalent to about 25 times Sophos’s free cash flow, which was well above valuations in the mid- to high-teens given to US security software makers such as Palo Alto, Fortinet and Checkpoint, said Morgan Stanley. “The scale of the premium to Friday’s close as well as US peers, could present a challenge to any potential counter bid,” it said. Sage, Avast and Aveva were among the sector peers to gain in sympathy.  Sellside stories ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded Ocado from “neutral” to “underweight” with a £10.50 target price.  Ocado’s £9bn valuation “is already stretched” based on its pipeline of licensed warehouses and its Marks and Spencer joint venture, said JPMorgan. It forecast current contracts and commitments from partners delivering nearly £900m of revenue by 2028, which the broker valued at £3bn or 411p a share. The M&S venture added another £872m. To justify the remainder of Ocado’s market value the company had to deliver another 126 warehouses on top of the 38 in the pipeline as of today, just three of which were operational, said JPMorgan. “Clearly, given Ocado’s efficiency benefits over the stockpicking solution of peers and management’s strong track record so far, this may indeed happen but at current levels the share price does not reflect any execution risk while any delay/postponement of projects would have a strong impact on Ocado’s cash flows and valuation,” it said.  The broker also highlighted that Ocado has so far signed exclusive contracts, shrinking the size of its addressable market. Valuing per warehouse at £44m or 6.1p per share, JPMorgan based its price target on Ocado signing deals for another 85 new warehouses. ● Jefferies repeated an “underweight” rating on NMC Health with a target cut from £19.86 to £19.25. Recent first-half results from the hospital operator were of lower quality than they first appeared, with reclassifications and potential destocking boosting working capital and free cash flow, it said.  “Distribution one-offs and a major jump in pharmacy sales are behind NMC hitting its organic growth target,” Jefferies said. While NMC reported 13 per cent first-half organic growth, the figure was distorted by a near doubling of pharmacy sales while underlying growth from the healthcare clinics was just 8.2 per cent, it said.  Healthcare pharmacy “had limited mention in the results release but in our view is the main contributor to group growth”, said Jefferies. “It is important to make the distinction between pharmacy and clinics growth, which we believe is the market’s primary focus.” Jefferies also highlighted that NMC had switched its presentation of net income growth for its first-half results. Using a reported rather than an adjusted figure meant NMC benefited from one-offs, which had not been clearly disclosed, said the broker. Changes in NMC’s methodology and classifications also improved working capital ratios, rendering year-on-year comparisons useless, it said. Jefferies’ analysis of the underlying figures pointed to weaker free cash flow conversion than the figure NMC reported.  A day before NMC’s results last month, Reuters reported that two groups, including one backed by China’s Fosun, had made competing offers to buy a 40 per cent stake in the hospital operator. The shares, which had been at risk of demotion from the FTSE 100, rallied as much as 40 per cent in response.  “We see no merit to this speculation as we believe the UK Listing Authority markets-monitoring team would have likely investigated,” said Jefferies. The broker also questioned whether NMC could follow through on an announcement last month that it would seek shareholder approval for a share buyback programme of up to $200m.  “NMC is focused on organic and acquisition growth so this came as a surprise to us given our view of cash conversion,” it said. “We estimate a buyback can’t be financed by existing cash flow if NMC is to maintain a high level of organic investments and would need to be financed with debt at [an interest rate of] circa 6 per cent.” Daily newsletter

"Cobham’s £4bn takeover shows money can trump sovereignty","For investors, Advent’s deal captures a recovery potential that the market price may never","What price sovereignty? When it comes to Brexit, the UK government appears to value control above any financial consideration. But when it comes to British companies, such as air-to-air-refuelling group Cobham, it seems the opposite is true. On Monday, 93 per cent of Cobham shareholders voted to accept a £4bn takeover by US private equity group Advent — and ministers look equally content with a change of control if it also keeps delivering value for money.  Investors evidently wanted some value for the £1bn they pumped in to Cobham in two separate rights issues, in 2016 and 2017. They were twice asked for money to pay down rising debt, after an ill-timed diversification strategy racked up losses. However, they evidently did not see a new management team delivering much value any time soon — at least not the 50 per cent uplift to Cobham’s three- month average share price offered by Advent, in cash.  Rejecting Advent and retaining a sense of sovereignty or control would have meant retaining the execution risk in the turnround strategy — and news of more problems with the KC-46 air tankers that Cobham works on, even if not Cobham related, only highlighted that risk. As one observer noted: “the turnround isn’t done yet”. To shareholders, then, 165p a share captures a recovery potential that the market price does not, and may never. While the founder’s daughter-in-law bemoans a cheap price for a “recapitalised” British world-beater, others see a difference between recapitalised and recovered. Government has always wanted value for money in defence spending — and, for all its talk about national security and industrial strategy, still seems comfortable with overseas suppliers if the price is right. Only last week, Leonardo of Italy was added to Team Tempest — the line up of tier one suppliers co-operating on the UK’s next generation fighter jet, which already includes European defence venture MBDA and Britain’s BAE Systems.  Almost all of Cobham’s in-flight refuelling technologies are sold to tier one suppliers that then supply the UK government, so a new US owner will be deemed no more of a risk than the companies building the planes that Cobham refuels. Or, as a Cobham spokesman put it, “value for money has been a significant consideration for MoD procurement decisions, rather than the national identity of the supplier”. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom’s preference for post-takeover undertakings, rather than pre-emptive interventions, suggests that it still is.  Ultimately, then, to both of these stakeholders in Cobham, sovereign concerns remain very much of the golden variety. Eddie Stobart: stretched “Red lorry, yellow lorry” is a tongue twister loved by elocution teachers, writes Kate Burgess. But Eddie Stobart, known for it green and red lorries, is a corporate twister that will be loved by business schoolteachers.  In 2017, the trucking company was floated by Dbay Advisors, a firm headed by Laxey Partners alumni, at 160p a share. Everything looked good at first, with revenues growing at 20-plus per cent a year and an apparently solid fan club of investors. These still include Dbay with 10 per cent, long-term backer Neil Woodford with about 23 per cent, and Invesco Perpetual with 5 per cent. Despite this line up of professional investors, though — or perhaps because of it — Eddie Stobart has made the kind of errors that have felled entrepreneurs and start-ups since Methuselah was a boy. Its latest update shows that it expanded too fast at the expense of profitability. Ambitious bosses were overgenerous with the dividend, did not pay enough heed to cash and were over-optimistic about the group’s prospects — or so it seems. Money coming in lagged behind the money going out. Revenues were recognised that may never materialise. Provisions on underperforming contracts were too low. Borrowings — £150m by May — were expected to fall but have been rising. The company says it will significantly undershoot forecasts for full-year pre-nasties earnings.  It is a textbook overstretch that institutional investors will have seen before, yet perhaps chose to overlook.  Now, the company is cutting the dividend, talking to lenders and murmuring about asking shareholders for more cash to keep going. The shares were suspended last month at 71p. Investors are learning a hard lesson for their indulgence.

"Ocado ploughs £17m into indoor farms","Advocates say stacked layers produce more consistent food and shorten supply chains","UK online supermarket Ocado is investing £17m in developing indoor farms, in a move that could eventually lead to customers picking their own produce. Indoor or “vertical” farms grow produce in stacked layers in purpose-built warehouses and under artificial light. They claim to use much less energy and water, produce more consistent food, not require pesticides and shorten supply chains. Ocado — which has been busy striking deals to build automated warehouses for other supermarket groups — said it ultimately aimed to have vertical farms next to its own delivery warehouses, with a view to delivering fresh produce within an hour of picking. Because these indoor farms can provide high volumes of produce they could also, in theory, be located next to or even inside other supermarkets. The FTSE 100 group will form a joint venture with 80 Acres Farms, a US vertical farming company and Priva, a Netherlands-based technology supplier, making a payment to both reflecting their investment to date. It will also contribute equity to the joint venture and provide a credit line. In a separate transaction, it will also acquire a 58 per cent stake in Jones Food, a UK vertical farming business that supplies food manufacturer Greencore with fresh herbs. Duncan Tatton-Brown, Ocado’s finance director, said the company could market the joint venture’s technology to other businesses. “We are interested in developing and ultimately selling vertical farming solutions to clients around the world.” He added that indoor farming “addresses fundamental consumer concerns about freshness and sustainability”.  “It’s not about growing the cheapest food possible. We want to grow quality products that taste wonderful,” he added. Stewart McGuire, the former Credit Suisse equity analyst who now runs Ocado’s ventures business, said the existing 80 Acres Farms facility in Ohio grew mostly tomatoes and cucumbers, but that the system lent itself to any crop that was relatively high value and had a short growing period.  The investment is the latest sign that Ocado is already looking to other markets beyond automated warehouses. It said at the time of its full-year results that it was interested in other areas where its expertise in sorting and automation could be put to use, potentially including baggage handling, parcel processing and car parking.  Last month, it paid £4.75m for an 18 per cent stake in Karakuri, which is developing a machine that automates the assembly of ready meals.  However, the company emphasised that its immediate priority was expanding its automated warehouse business in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia. ","10.06.2019"
"WeWork turmoil puts spotlight on JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs","Exit of Adam Neumann as chief executive highlights role of banks in IPO flop","When Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank turned on Adam Neumann, triggering the boardroom coup that led to his resignation as chief executive of WeWork on Tuesday, it was a remarkable rift between the controversial co-founder and his largest investor, which has channelled $10.65bn into the office leasing company. With his future still in the balance at the weekend, Mr Neumann’s response was to call on another of the important financial figures in his orbit: Jamie Dimon. Sunday’s visit to meet the JPMorgan Chase chief executive ultimately did nothing to halt Mr Neumann’s fate, but it did highlight the depth of a relationship between the entrepreneur and Mr Dimon’s bank, which began courting him when he had just one building. Wall Street executives have fallen over themselves to woo Mr Neumann and his company, but it was JPMorgan that won the coveted lead role on an initial public offering designed to bring in at least $3bn to cover WeWork’s swelling losses, plus $6bn in an associated debt financing.  But stock market investors thumbed their nose at WeWork’s business model and Mr Neumann’s flouting of corporate governance norms, enabled in part by JPMorgan. Along with other advisers including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan’s own reputation risks being tainted by the unfolding crisis. According to pitch books reviewed by the Financial Times and interviews with people briefed on the process, IPO bankers dangled potential valuations even higher than the $47bn price tag Mr Son’s last investment put on the company. 
 JPMorgan told WeWork executives the company could be worth between $46bn and $63bn in the listing. Goldman pegged the equity at between $61bn and $96bn. Morgan Stanley estimated WeWork’s valuation at between $43bn and $104bn in a presentation in 2018, though a pitch for the IPO set it at a more modest $18bn-$52bn. Michael Grimes, Morgan Stanley’s top tech banker, made an impassioned pitch to Mr Neumann, but the investment bank ultimately declined to work on the offering when it lost out on the lead role.  If JPMorgan’s institutional investors were throwing up all over this, they should have knownDavid Spreng, Runway Growth Capital As WeWork prepped for its flotation, there were clear signals from public investors that they were not willing to bankroll lossmaking unicorns at any price. Shares of the ride-hailing pioneer Uber, another SoftBank investment, have slid precipitously since its stock market listing this year. WeWork pulled its IPO earlier this month after failing to find enthusiasm at a valuation as low as $15bn. David Spreng, founder of a Silicon Valley lender called Runway Growth Capital, questioned why WeWork’s underwriters had not identified investor concerns sooner in the process. “That is their job,” he said: “Today, there’s a lot of pre-marketing [of IPOs]. If JPMorgan’s institutional investors were throwing up all over this, they should have known.” More than $100m in fees are riding on the IPO, to be split among 31 banks, and the listing was just one in what many bankers hoped would be a series of lucrative mandates. JPMorgan was poised to earn $50m structuring a $6bn loan lent by it and a group of banks including Goldman, Bank of America, Citigroup, UBS and Wells Fargo, for example. While several big banks have already earned millions of dollars in fees from WeWork. WeWork’s parent company, the We Company, has said it still plans to list its shares this year. People briefed on the matter, however, said it was increasingly likely any listing could slip to 2020 or even beyond. While many big banks have already earned millions of dollars in fees from WeWork, none is as entwined with the company and its co-founder as JPMorgan. It led a $1.2bn credit line for the company in 2015, was the lead underwriter on its $702m corporate debt sale last year and has extended part of a $500m personal loan to Mr Neumann along with UBS and Credit Suisse. It has been the bank of choice for Mr Neumann when he has taken out mortgages to finance his own property purchases — including deals, now unwound, that attracted conflict of interest questions because he took stakes in buildings that were leased to WeWork. In August JPMorgan said it had lent Mr Neumann a further $97.5m. The bank’s asset management arm has also invested directly in WeWork. The WeWork relationship had been seen as critical to JPMorgan’s hopes of supplanting Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley’s dominance in investment banking for technology companies. The concerted effort to court WeWork executives was led by the bank’s vice-chairman Noah Wintroub, who first met Mr Neumann when the company opened its first building in Manhattan in 2010. He has even gone so far as to follow up when the WeWork chief executive complained about his Chase bank account, Mr Wintroub told the FT in January.  Goldman Sachs also worked to embed itself in Mr Neumann’s financial life. Chief executive David Solomon visited WeWork’s Chelsea headquarters this year — “to kiss the ring”, as one former WeWork executive put it — after taking over from Lloyd Blankfein. The daily tending of the relationship fell to Goldman partner Kim Posnett, global head of internet investment banking, as well as Dan Dees and David Ludwig. Like JPMorgan, Goldman invested directly in WeWork in venture funding rounds dating back to at least 2014, according to data provider PitchBook. And Mr Neumann gave the keynote speech at a charity event honouring Mr Solomon late last year, an event that Mr Blankfein also attended. Throughout the IPO process, Mr Neumann and his executive team at WeWork — including co-presidents Artie Minson and Jennifer Berrent and general counsel Jared DeMatteis — have leaned on the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for guidance. Skadden partner Ryan Dzierniejko, who has worked on listings including Match Group, Markit and Shopify, helped to restructure the company to provide tax advantages to its early investors and helped to navigate concerns raised by the Securities and Exchange Commission over some of the more unusual financial metrics WeWork planned to include in its prospectus. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Skadden, SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment for this article. While the imbroglio puts the reputations of JPMorgan and the other advisers in the spotlight, the next chapter probably involves more advisers, not fewer. Already two top crisis communications groups have been brought in to work with Gladstone Place Partners, WeWork’s original public relations firm for the IPO: Sard Verbinnen, which represents SoftBank, has been hired by WeWork, as has Edelman.  In a 2009 sketch of their start-up’s ambitions, Mr Neumann and his co-founder Miguel McKelvey envisaged running Caribbean chartered yachts, a luxury hotel chain and a “WeBank” that would provide “first-class financial services” to the entrepreneurs that use its office space. A decade later, WeWork’s banking arm — and the yacht business — has failed to materialise and Mr Neumann, pushed out into a non-executive chairman role, is left pondering whether his own advisers have provided the first class services he was hoping.","24.09.2019"
"Opening Quote: The costs of Thomas Cook’s collapse are piling up","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.  The cost of the Thomas Cook collapse is becoming clearer — and it is not a pretty picture. The government and the travel industry’s insurance scheme — Air Travel Organiser’s Licence or Atol — is facing a bill of more than £500m, according to official estimates. The government has already said the cost of refunding future bookings under the Atol scheme will be around £420m. In addition, it will cost tens of millions of pounds to repay hoteliers who have lost out and there is an estimated bill of £100m for chartering 1,000 flights to return Thomas Cook customers to the UK. That amount would eclipse what is available through the Atol scheme. In its most recent accounts, Atol’s parent fund, the Air Travel Trust, reported net assets of £170m and a £400m insurance policy, making a total of £570m it could call on. And it is not just the government that is going to lose out. Commercial lenders, too, have big exposure to the failed tour operator. Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Scotland are facing writedowns of up to £1.8bn. Estimates compiled by AlixPartners, which has been appointed to manage the liquidation, before the UK travel group collapsed and which have been seen by the Financial Times, show that as little as £138m would be recovered for the lenders out of the money they lent. Bondholders are also on the list of parties that will lose out. They are expected to write down between £900m and £1bn. Meanwhile MPs, who returned to work this week, announced on Thursday that they would hold an inquiry into the company’s collapse, focusing on its accounting practices, executive pay, and the role of its auditors. All this as stranded passengers continue to return from their ruined holidays. The BBC is reporting on Friday morning that the Civil Aviation Authority has now flown back a total of 61,000 holidaymakers — 40 per cent of the total. Briefly There is very little breaking news on Friday morning but shares in City broker Numis are under pressure after it issued a profit warning. It blamed “political uncertainty” and “challenging market conditions” for the downgrade to its profit forecast. Michael Spencer, the founder of financial company Nex Group and its predecessor ICAP and one of the City of London’s best-known entrepreneurs, will not be pleased. He recently built a 6 per cent stake in Numis, a company he once chaired. Jaguar Land Rover will close its UK plants for a week in November to try to reduce disruption to its supply chain in the days following Britain’s expected departure from the EU. Britain’s largest carmaker will shut sites at Halewood, Castle Bromwich, Solihull, and its engine plant in Wolverhampton for up to eight days, chief executive Ralf Speth said. Job moves Rachel Osborne, the chief financial officer who helped steer Debenhams through a complicated pre-pack administration and restructuring, is leaving the group after a year to take up the same role at Ted Baker. Ms Osborne was the only member of the Debenhams executive team that Mike Ashley did not want sacked as he battled for control of the department store chain earlier this year. Aviva has appointed Jason Windsor as chief financial officer. He was appointed interim CFO on July 1 when Tom Stoddard stepped down after five years with the UK insurance group. Previously Mr Windsor ran Aviva’s UK business and was also chief capital and investments officer. Johan de Nysschen, the former boss of Cadillac, has joined Volkswagen as chief operating officer of the VW brand in North America. He brings the experience of stints at Audi and Nissan's Infiniti nameplate to the role trying to help the German company to increase its historically-low presence in the all-important US market.

 Beyond the Square Mile  Peloton got off to a sluggish start as a public company after closing lower on its first day of trading. Shares in the Silicon Valley-based provider of fitness equipment opened at $27 and traded as low as $24.75 — a drop of 14.7 per cent — before finishing 11.2 per cent lower on the day at $25.76. Peloton’s public offering is the latest highly anticipated IPO to disappoint this year. Uber, which listed in May, is trading about 30 per cent lower than its $45 a share IPO price, while Lyft, which made its debut in March, has slipped 42 per cent from its $72 listing price. Others, though, have fared better. Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based burgers, is up 500 per cent from its IPO price and video conferencing group Zoom Communications has gained 127 per cent since floating. Peloton floated 40m of class A common stock at $29 per share, raising $1.2bn. WeWork, another IPO that has not gone to plan, has put a halt to the signing of new lease agreements with property owners as the lossmaking group tries to rapidly rein in costs. Landlords have been bracing for the possibility that WeWork, which has become the biggest office tenant in New York and one of the largest in London, could suspend its expansion. News of the lease suspension comes after credit rating agency S&P downgraded WeWork, citing concerns about the company’s access to capital and governance practices. Swedish telecoms equipment company Ericsson said its 5G rollout would take a hit after booking provisions of $1.2bn ahead of the conclusion of US probes into overseas corruption allegations. The company, which has been under investigation by US authorities since 2013, said on Thursday it had identified violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as its own code of ethics in China, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Indonesia, Djibouti and Vietnam.

"The secrets of ‘Succession’","HBO’s hit series features a cast of grasping tycoons with few redeeming qualities. What’s not to like?","“Emotional gunship incoming,” says Kendall Roy, watching from the deck of his family’s oligarch-level yacht as its patriarch, Logan, approaches in a helicopter. “Send out the distress signal, we are under attack,” adds sister Siobhan, known as Shiv. We are, indeed, under attack. Verbal attack. The just-finished second series of HBO’s Succession
, a fast-walking-and-talking gallop through self-made Scottish mogul Logan Roy’s “empire of shit” and its dynastic media ambition, has meme-d and gif-ted itself into the spotlight. It has cruised from “sleeper” hit (meaning that media people love it and keep talking it up on socials) to actual hit (meaning enough viewers love it for it to be renewed for another season, which is what has happened). The surprising thing about the buzz and love for Succession, according to many commentators, is that people love it despite the fact that all the super-rich Roys are repellent human beings. Is this perhaps a show where we are meant to fall in love not with its characters but with their carapace, the beautifully rendered “Rich Kids of Instagram” aesthetic? (Uniformed staff, private jets, New England neutrals, yacht bling, penthouse steel and glass.) It is not. Talk of likeability on television or in books, plays or any other sort of cultural fodder is looking increasingly redundant. This show succeeds precisely because likeability is one luxury that we don’t need any more, especially when it comes to rich and powerful people. We may finally have stopped looking for redemption in all the usual places. The US is led by a nepotistic ruling family. Britain is being torn apart by internecine political power struggles. Strongmen-bullies are in charge around the world — and we are helpless. “Well Kim Jong Pop, that’s not how things work in this country,” Roman tells his father in season one, when Logan wants to buy up “all the news” he doesn’t already own. But in season two, when the Roys shut down Vaulter, a millennial news website they had bought on a whim, we see that bullying with billionaire menaces is, in fact, exactly how things work. Just ask Gawker. (In totally unconnected news, real-life media heir James Murdoch last week bought a minority share in online news company Vice.) By watching rich people doing terrible things but being very witty and well-dressed about it, we give ourselves an escape valve from all the grim things that their real-life counterparts are actually doing in the world. There’s a pattern here: Succession isn’t the first show to do this. It’s just the funniest. For those seeking more post-likeability in their lives, Showtime’s Billions
 is a satisfying collision of hedge funders and political ambition. It’s testosterone-max, but has far more tenderness at its heart than Succession, with a central couple, Chuck and Wendy Rhoades (Paul Giamatti and Maggie Siff), who love each other on some level, despite a history of mutual betrayal and a painfully unequal interest in torture dungeons. Over on Netflix, its new streamer The Politician
 throws big production bucks at a more mannered, less turbocharged take on all the power that money can buy, complete with Gwyneth Paltrow doing the gardening in couture. Succession was created by Jesse Armstrong, a Briton who co-wrote Peep Show and The Thick of It: foul-mouthed and cringe-filled comedies, full of the kinds of socially awkward people you perhaps shared an office with during the shiny, complacent years of the New Labour government. In these two shows, Armstrong observed civilians under pressure: respectively south London flat sharers with no money and terrible jobs, and politicians and advisers at the mercy of a relentless news cycle and venal bosses. It was all quite relatable. In Succession, Armstrong has upgraded effortlessly from characters in the three-zeros income bracket to those with nine zeros. There are some mere millionaires, notably the side-flunkies in the Waystar-Royco company orbit who actually have to work for a living. (This group includes fan favourite Gerri, general counsel and dirty-talker in chief to Roman Roy.) As Connor, the oldest — and Trumpiest — Roy son, tells less affluent Cousin Greg, the latter’s potential inheritance of $5m is perhaps the worst amount anyone can have. “Five’s a nightmare. Can’t retire, not worth it to work.” (“The poorest rich person in America,” chips in Shiv’s husband Tom, who probably hasn’t even got $5m of his own, poor soul.) It is no coincidence that Greg, brought up ostracised from the Roy clan, is the blundering newcomer who still has vestiges of decency about him. He doesn’t know there is a “glass floor” that protects the children of the elite from falling downwards. Reportedly the Succession writers are told to read the FT (along with Vanity Fair and the New York Times). And why not? In recent weeks alone we have covered a spying scandal at Credit Suisse that reportedly began with a neighbour dispute in Zurich’s most exclusive lakeside enclave, while WeWork, the overheated office space company on a mission to “elevate the world’s consciousness” has morphed from unicorn to (how best to put it?) donkey in a matter of weeks. Until season three of Succession arrives, there are many consolations to be found in the heady post-likeability of the real-life power players. Isabel Berwick is editor of FT Work & Careers

"Brookfield leads $8.4bn deal for Genesee & Wyoming","Singapore’s GIC part of consortium offering 39.5% premium to buy freight rail operator","Brookfield Asset Management has joined forces with Singapore’s GIC and a group of smaller investors to acquire US freight railroad owner and operator Genesee & Wyoming for about $8.4bn, the latest in a series of acquisitions led by the deal-hungry Canadian investment group. The Brookfield-led consortium of investors has agreed to pay G&W shareholders $112 in cash for each common share, a 39.5 per cent premium based on the company’s stock price prior to media reports on March 8 about a sale.  Brookfield, which has about $475bn of assets under management since it acquired capital markets investor Oaktree Capital, has deployed billions of dollars in mega deals in recent months buying several assets in financial services, real estate and infrastructure sectors.  Toronto-based Brookfield is seeking to position itself as the main rival to Stephen Schwarzman’s Blackstone, which remains the most dominant alternative asset manager, with assets ranging from real estate to technology companies.  The Canadian firm last year bought the car battery division of Johnson Controls in a debt-fuelled $13.2bn deal that ranked among the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis a decade ago.  It also acquired nuclear specialist Westinghouse out of bankruptcy. Closed high-profile real estate deals include a long-term lease on 666 Fifth Avenue, which is owned by the family of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, paying rent in advance for 99 years. G&W controls a portfolio of 120 railroads across North America, Europe and Australia, where it provides transportation services to more than 3,000 customers along more than 26,000km of tracks.  “This is a rare opportunity to acquire a large-scale transport infrastructure business in North America,” Sam Pollock, chief executive of Brookfield Infrastructure, said. “[G&W’s] cash flows have proven to be highly resilient over many years.” Brookfield said it will invest about $500m of equity; the rest will be owned by the Canadian firm’s institutional partners and GIC. Financing for the deal will be led by a syndicate of banks including Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and RBC. The deal is expected to close by early 2020. For the transaction to go through, G&W will need the backing of shareholders controlling 66 per cent of the outstanding common stock. ","01.07.2019"
"Ovarian cancer treatment boosts GSK","UK drugmaker has been under pressure to produce new money-spinning medicines","GlaxoSmithKline has announced that a drug acquired in a controversial $5.1bn deal last year has demonstrated its effectiveness in stopping the spread of ovarian cancer when taken as the first treatment after a patient has undergone chemotherapy, in a significant boost for the UK drugmaker. GSK, which has been under pressure to produce new blockbusters amid investor concern that the company was failing to produce as many money-spinning medicines as rivals, said Zejula “met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression free survival for women”, regardless of whether they possessed a particular genetic mutation. The announcement is the company’s most significant oncology data readout since it swapped its cancer drugs business for Novartis’s vaccines division more than five years ago. It is also the first big announcement since Hal Barron was appointed as head of R&D, with a remit to stock the company’s pipeline in part through strategic M&A. GSK is likely to see it as a vindication of its decision to buy Tesaro, and its claim at that time that the potential of the PARP inhibitor class of drugs, to which Zejula belongs, was under-appreciated. When the deal was announced last December, investors showed their concern, reflecting the competitive nature of the PARP field, and GSK’s shares fell more than 7 per cent, wiping about £5bn from its market value. At the moment, about 15 per cent of women have the BRCA gene mutation that qualifies them to receive a drug in this category. In the past the company has suggested that, if the medicine worked even in patients who do not have that mutation, the pool of women who could benefit could triple, opening up a far wider market. Analysts at Credit Suisse said the potential for this broad “all comers” label was “a positive surprise” and potentially “a big opportunity” for the company. At the time of the Tesaro acquisition, some analysts had suggested that it might struggle against Lynparza, another ovarian cancer drug, that is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Merck. On Monday Hal Barron, GSK’s chief scientific officer and president of R&D, said: “Almost 300,000 women around the world are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year, yet only about 15 per cent of patients are currently eligible to receive PARP inhibitors as their initial therapy. These exciting data demonstrate that Zejula has the potential to significantly benefit even more women with this devastating cancer.” Around 22,000 women are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer in the US, and more than 65,000 women annually in Europe, underlining the size of the potential market. Ovarian cancer is the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death among women.","15.07.2019"
"Merck agrees $1bn deal to buy biopharmaceutical company Peloton","Group that is developing a renal cancer treatment had been planning a New York listing","US pharmaceutical company Merck has agreed a $1.05bn cash deal to buy Peloton Therapeutics, gaining access to the biopharmaceutical company’s renal cancer drug treatment that is in development.  Peloton had been planning an initial public offering in New York, and its shareholders will be eligible to receive an additional $1.15bn, dependent on future regulatory and sales milestones.  The company is in the late-stage development of a treatment for renal cell carcinoma, which Merck said has shown “intriguing activity” in the treatment of the kidney cancer. Merck is the latest pharmaceutical company to strike a major deal to improve its pipeline of cancer treatments.  In January, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to a $90bn deal to buy Celgene, a biotech company with a deep portfolio of cancer-focused assets, while Eli Lilly and GlaxoSmithKline have also recently bought companies to bolster their oncology treatments. “We look forward to advancing this late-stage asset as part of our broad oncology R&D programme,” said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. Peloton filed documents supporting a $160m listing on the Nasdaq exchange last week. The company had planned to sell 9.375m shares at a price between $15 and $17 a share.  The deal, which is subject to some conditions. is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. Credit Suisse acted as a financial adviser to Merck, while Centerview Partners advised Peloton.

"No one wins in the rabbit-hole world of negative interest rates","Hiding money in vaults might not be the ultimate intention but it’s a cheaper option","It emerged last week that UBS is planning to charge its wealth clients, those with more than SFr2m ($2m) of deposits with the Swiss bank, a negative interest rate. Credit Suisse is thinking of doing the same. Other private banks already do this. With the European Central Bank expected to move its rates further into negative territory in the coming weeks, the phenomenon seems likely to spread. In this Alice in Wonderland world, characterised by its vast post-crisis monetary policy experiment, we really have gone down the rabbit hole. Negative rates are supposed to stimulate the economy, incentivising investment by making it less attractive to hold cash and spurring demand by making credit cheaper. But evidence of the theory working in practice is far from conclusive. Certainly Europe’s bankers are squealing, as they feel margins squeezed by low rates on lending and a reluctance to pass on negative rates to depositors. Last week famously blunt ING boss Ralph Hamers excelled himself, all but calling the ECB idiotic for planning to shift rates further downwards. “The negative rate environment is making consumers so uncertain about their financial environment that they’re starting to save more rather than less,” he said. Mr Hamers has a point. Rather than encouraging people to borrow and spend, the data suggests nervous eurozone consumers are hoarding. Eurostat reports the eurozone household savings ratio is at a five-year high of nearly 13 per cent. A similar but more dramatic phenomenon seems to be in evidence among the big wealth managers. One reason why UBS and CS are planning to pass on negative rates is that wealthy clients’ obsession with cash has become such a large problem for them. UBS reckons 26 per cent of its clients’ assets are held in cash. At CS, the proportion is 29 per cent. This runs counter to the theory that investors right around the world are hungry for investment returns. Starved of decent yields on bonds, they have supposedly been drawn into riskier asset classes. There is clear evidence of this happening among institutional investors. The flow of pension fund money into any asset that promises to beat zero-rate bonds has been so dramatic that equities, junk bonds, property, private equity and a host of other more abstruse areas of investment have spiralled in value — and to such an extent that they look highly vulnerable to any shock: US recession; no-deal Brexit; more extreme US-China trade tensions; an escalating stand-off between Iran and the west. This indeed is one theory why the Swiss banks’ wealth clients are being so cautious. Wealth advisers say clients have been missing out on returns for a decade, fearful that the 2008 crash will be replicated in the next recession. But at this point they are probably being perfectly rational in showing reluctance to invest at the top of the market. There may also be a regional bias. Ultra-wealthy Swiss clients, surrounded by anaemic European economic performance, are more cautious than bullish Americans. Certainly some rival banks report very different risk appetites. Raymond James, a US wealth manager, has seen clients push their cash holdings to record lows of about 6 per cent in the US and below 5 per cent in the UK, as they desperately seek out returns. Who’s to say which stance is right? The downturn will come but it may be some time away. And the “opportunity cost” of staying in cash could be large. “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” So, infamously, said Chuck Prince, Citigroup’s former boss — ultimately to the cost of his job and the viability of his bank. What, then, is the solution? Clients keen to maintain their cautious, cash-based approach, but dodge a negative interest rate, could bear this in mind. For SFr1,000 a year, your typical Swiss private bank will give you a cubic metre of vault storage for your valuables. Thanks to Switzerland’s high-value SFr1,000 notes, that should be enough space to salt away close to SFr1bn in hard cash. The fee is a sight cheaper than the SFr7.5m charge that a 0.75 per cent negative interest rate would imply. Hiding money in vaults is probably not the productive dynamic that policymakers were hoping for but it’s starting to make sense. Welcome to the rabbit hole. patrick.jenkins@ft.com

"Alzheimer’s drug revival gives hope to millions — and investors","Biogen says seeking approval for aducanumab hails ‘turning point’ in fight against disease","The revival of a potential drug to fight Alzheimer’s, whose clinical trials had been declared futile just months ago, proved the value of sticking with the search for treatments for the disease when other pharmaceuticals companies are “running away”, according to the chief executive of its developer, Biogen. By announcing on Tuesday that it would seek regulatory approval after all for its drug aducanumab, the US biotech company gave new hope to millions of patients and caregivers — and its shareholders.  Michel Vounatsos, Biogen chief executive, told the Financial Times that the new data analysed since the company halted a patient trial in March marked a “turning point in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease”.  But among Alzheimer’s researchers and campaigners, who have lived through decades of dashed hopes, the unmistakable excitement was tempered by a battle-hardened caution. Biogen shares reflected that: having opened almost 40 per cent higher, they closed on Tuesday with a somewhat more modest 26 per cent gain.   While the opportunity is huge, so are the hurdles. The theory that Alzheimer’s patients suffer from a build-up of amyloid plaques — hard clumps of protein between nerve cells in the brain — may have found statistical support in a large-scale human trial for the first time, but the full data will not be published until December. Biogen licensed aducanumab in 2007 from Neurimmune, a Swiss company which had found evidence some people benefited from antibodies that cleared away the plaques, and has been working to turn these antibodies into a potential drug ever since. In March a so-called futility analysis of its two late-stage trials for the drug found the benefits did not outweigh the risks. The company abandoned the trials, seemingly adding aducanumab to the list of once-promising Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed in the late stages of testing, leaving the industry with little to show for the billions of dollars spent.  Mr Vounatsos said Biogen remained focused on finding treatments for the degenerative condition when other “companies are running away” and called the reversal “a testament to our persistence and pioneering role”. Higher doses proved key to trial’s success
 The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said studying a larger data set had shown aducanumab did work if it was taken at higher doses, improving patient cognition and their ability to perform daily tasks such as cleaning and shopping and slowing their clinical decline by 23 per cent compared to a placebo. Crucially, it announced that the US drug regulator was open to it filing for an approval.  One of the two trials met its goal. On the study that failed, a subset of patients saw success: those who had taken more of the drug also had their decline slowed. Biogen had at first been cautious about giving higher doses because of a side effect that swelled the brain — but the majority of patients did not experience any symptoms.  Paola Barbarino, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International, which represents 100 Alzheimer’s associations and federations around the world, described the announcement as “the most positive piece of news we have had in decades” but warned that it was “quite early stages”.  If one company is successful . . . that will create more interest and more pharmacological innovationPaola Barbarino, Alzheimer’s Disease International Analysts questioned whether the data really would be enough to convince the US Food and Drug Adminstration to approve the drug. Evan Seigerman, an analyst at Credit Suisse, warned investors to beware of “hype” around the prospective Alzheimer’s drug while it remains unclear which patients it works best for or how to decide on the right dose while avoiding side effects.  Others were relieved they had not been wrong to be shocked in March. “After months of apologising for getting this story so wrong, we are relieved and not entirely surprised,” said Thomas Shrader, an analyst at BTIG. “Our detailed molecular thesis for aducanumab was that removing ‘junk’ from a patient’s brain should help.” Biogen must have received a “very strong signal” from the FDA to announce that it will seek approval, just a day after its second meeting with the agency, said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVB Leerink.  “I think the FDA of five to 10 years ago would have thrown this out and said, ‘Go and do another study.’ But the current FDA is fairly patient — and industry-friendly and seems inclined to find a way to approve the drug,” he said. The prize, and the price, of an Alzheimer’s drug
 Even if it does win approval, Biogen will have to be careful how it prices the treatment, given insurers and healthcare systems may struggle to pay for it for millions of patients. Mr Vounatsos would not discuss pricing at this stage, but said the disease created half a trillion dollars in direct and indirect costs, indicating how the company will seek to justify its price tag. James Kupiec, chief medical officer of PromisNeurosciences and the former head of Pfizer’s neuroscience unit, said Biogen’s reversal will “revitalise” the work pursuing the hypothesis that amyloid plaque causes the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer’s patients, which many scientists had recently “poo-pooed”. Ms Barbarino agreed it could catalyse investment in the field. “If one company is successful . . . that will create more interest and more pharmacological innovation,” she said. It would also help draw new young researchers, with fresh ideas, to the work. “If all you hear is failure, people are less likely to join the fray,” she said.   Few companies had given up entirely on Alzheimer’s research, Ms Barbarino suggested, since many big-name pharma businesses were at least continuing to explore data sets. Shares in smaller, Alzheimer’s-focused biotechs Denali Therapeutics and Alector rose more than 5 per cent on Tuesday. Alison Evans, head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said that scientists should also continue to look beyond the amyloid plaque. “It is really important we explore all avenues,” she said. “We have so much unmet need, we need as many shots on goal as possible.”","23.10.2019"
"SocGen hits capital targets early in rare bright spot","French lender’s shares climb as forecasts are eclipsed despite a difficult quarter","Société Générale has hit its capital targets ahead of schedule even as the cost of restructuring its struggling investment bank squeezes the French lender’s profits. Net profits fell 14 per cent in the second quarter to €1.05bn from the same period a year ago, eclipsing forecasts of €930m. The bank’s revenues of €6.3bn for the quarter were down 2.6 per cent from a year ago, but matched expectations.  However, analysts had focused on the bank’s capital levels head of the results, with those at JPMorgan Chase arguing that “concerns around SocGen’s capital position are a primary driver of the [bank’s] derating”. The bank said on Thursday that it had hit its 2020 capital targets in the second quarter, lifting its core tier equity one capital ratio — a closely watched measure of balance-sheet strength — by 50 basis points to 12 per cent. Analysts had seen the ratio coming in at 11.9 per cent.  The bank hit the 12 per cent target thanks to a mix of asset disposals, including Eurobank in Poland, the reduction of risk-weighted assets, particularly in its investment bank, and the decision to pay some of its dividend in shares. It now expects its CET1 ratio to come in between 12.4 and 12.8 per cent by the end of 2020, above expectations of 12.2 per cent.  That sent SocGen’s shares up more than 5 per cent in late-morning trading. The bank’s shares have fallen almost 42 per cent over the past 12 months, underperforming French rivals over the same period.  Chief executive Frédéric Oudéa, who has led the bank for more than a decade, has come under pressure as the bank’s stock has struggled. The bank took a €227m restructuring charge in the quarter, part of the plan it outlined in April to eliminate €500m in costs and cut 1,600 jobs after poor performance in its trading unit in the fourth quarter of last year.
 “Based on what has been achieved in the first half of 2019 the capital debate is no longer an issue, if they are able to stick to the plan,” said Maxence Le Gouvello Du Timat, an analyst at Jefferies.  Mr Oudéa said the investment banking plan had now entered “the execution phase” with the bank’s chief financial officer, William Kadouch-Chassaing, saying that “we have executed close to €5bn out of the €8bn risk-weighted asset” deleveraging planned by the end of 2020. However, SocGen’s investment bank continued to toil in the second quarter, even if it did outshine expectations. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading revenues were ahead of consensus estimates, but still down 9.7 per cent from a year ago. That contrasted with a gain of 8.8 per cent in FICC revenues unveiled on Wednesday at French rival BNP Paribas. Revenue from equities trading, a traditional strength for SocGen, also fell 6.6 per cent in the quarter from a year ago. Flora Benhakoun, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said SocGen’s French retail division topped estimates thanks to lower costs. Its international retail business had better revenues and provisions. However, Jon Pearce, a strategist at Credit Suisse, said that while he “would expect a constructive initial reaction to a lack of negative surprises, we do not yet perceive a significant change to operating trends.”","01.08.2019"
"A long week for trading trade negotiations","Mike Mackenzie’s daily analysis of what’s moving global markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email. Low expectations means there’s scope for a pleasant surprise. And a long week beckons for financial markets with the US and China resuming their long running and tortured pace of trade negotiations on Thursday. © AFP The US wants a broad trade deal, whereas China appears focused on a narrow agreement, that leaves plenty of wriggle room. For example, reforming Chinese industrial policy or government subsidies, two key areas of contention for the US, are reportedly off the table says Beijing. Marc Ostwald at ADM Investor Services sums up current sentiment: “A narrow limited deal would of course be welcome, though the best that can probably be hoped for is for some form of ‘truce’ extension.” Now there is a sense that some trace of progress on trade should buoy equity sentiment. Perhaps, but investors are mindful that higher US tariffs are slated for Chinese goods next week, with American tariffs on $7.5bn worth of European products looming on October 18. That may explain a lack of bullish enthusiasm for US equities through the options market, which in turn sends a cautionary signal for global share markets. Mandy Xu at Credit Suisse highlights how unlike past periods of broader weakness in share prices and also before the start of trade talks, buyers of call options (contracts that benefit when the broad market rises) are not showing up, and she notes: “This is an interesting change in behaviour: since August, call demand has collapsed during market sell-offs in contrast to December ’18 or May ’19 when we saw call buyers step in during market weakness to play for a rebound.”  No bid for upside — SPX call skew drops to one-year low

  “Also notable is that unlike in the past when investors got bullish ahead of major US-China trade talks (SPX call skew hit a high ahead of the G20 talk last December), we’re not seeing similar optimism this time around as trade talks restart.” That suggests that good news on trade talks between the US and China will probably fail to drive the S&P 500 index much beyond its recent ceiling (since early July) of around 3,000 points. Instead, a churn or sector rotation likely ensues and one marked by selling call options argues BTIG, whose analysts reckon more economically sensitive sectors benefit at the expense of richer valued defensive names within the stock market. BTIG adds, “in an environment where volatility is likely to remain elevated” that boosts “the attractiveness of selectively targeted option premium selling strategies”. Clearly the course of this week’s trade discussions will influence sentiment and drive trading activity across markets. A good outcome may resonate far more for Europe than the S&P 500. October has already been tough for European equities (relative to Wall Street and Asia) and its more economically sensitive sectors (banks, autos and basic resources) are all down more than 4 per cent so far this month. On both a year-to-date and 12-month basis, these three sectors seriously lag the Stoxx 600. Katie Nixon at Northern Trust says: “While the GDP backdrop for Europe may appear challenged right now, European companies are highly leveraged to an improvement in global economic growth and a resolution — even an interim deal — of the US/China trade disputes.” Almost two years have passed since President Donald Trump began pushing hard on trade and in that time as China has retaliated, the FT writes here how the global economy has lost momentum. Holding the line have been central banks, easing at their fastest pace since the financial crisis era, while government bond yields are substantially lower for the year, providing a valuation crutch for equities and credit. This also matters given how a slowing global economy is weighing on corporate profits growth alongside business and consumer confidence.  Pressure on corporate margins has yet to trigger bigger job losses, although some European banks are in cost-cutting mode, and today HSBC has upped the ante. Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects the first US earnings per share decline for the third quarter “since the 2015-16 earnings recession”. Its analysts note: “We forecast $41.75 for 3Q EPS, a 1 per cent beat versus analysts’ $41.29 estimate, and a 2 per cent year-on-year EPS decline” with the biggest cuts in energy and materials sectors. Ultimately, earnings growth needs to pick up as the rebound in global equities this year has reflected lower bond yields and monetary easing boosting multiples. This time last year, for example, expectations entailed S&P 500 earnings expanding about a 10th for 2019. Now the market expects a 2 per cent growth pace for this year and clings to an optimistic rebound in 2020. BlackRock highlights how: “Rising price/earnings ratios have been the principal contributor to global equity performance in 2019. Earnings growth has only been a modest contributor in the US — and detracted in other regions.” Equity sources of total return in 2019

  The asset manager’s analysts conclude: “We do expect the Federal Reserve to cut further, yet we believe markets may be pricing in too much additional easing in the year ahead. This points to limited scope for further multiple expansion and increases the importance of earnings growth in driving further gains.” BlackRock thinks the outlook looks better on a six to 12-month horizon as monetary easing works its way through the economy. But over at Morgan Stanley, its US equity strategists question how long lower yields can offset concerns over growth: “The Fed cutting should have arguably been supportive of long duration growth assets, but their recent weakness despite the Fed’s cuts tells us that the market is increasingly sceptical about the growth outlook going forward and is transitioning from a late-cycle to an end-of-cycle mindset.” Along with others, Morgan Stanley also voices concern about the recent poor reception for companies making their public debuts, and worries about “a second order effect of cooling sales growth” across web services, software and advertising. Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar The Brexit road map has something for everyone as shown here via RBC Capital Markets, where as it observes the chances of a UK departure from the EU with or without a deal stands at roughly 40 per cent each, with a residual one-fifth chance of Brexit never happening:  As the FT notes, attention is slowly drifting to what happens after the EU summit on October 17 if no pact is agreed. And the FT’s Robert Shrimsley writes, the EU’s likely rejection of Boris Johnson’s plan will leave the prime minister forced to delay Brexit and face an election. A US tech rotation that favours the smaller fish is gaining momentum. Jim Paulsen at The Leuthold Group says “mini-Fang [stocks] now offer a significantly higher growth profile at a substantially lower valuation”.  Jim adds that while the forward p/e multiple on the S&P 600 technology index is currently equal to that of the S&P 500 technology index, since 2002, “small-cap tech stocks’ forward multiple has been at an 18 per cent average premium”.

"Foreign investors should be wary of the seductive India story","Victory for Modi comes just as indicators show a dramatic slowing in the economy","Narendra Modi, India’s newly re-elected prime minister, stands to gain as the trade war between Washington and Beijing boils over. Investor are betting that manufacturers will shift their supply chains away from China as the US turns screws on its Asian rival. That leaves India poised to move up the pecking order for global manufacturing, say the optimists. “[We] continue to view Modi as the most pro-growth leader in the world today and a leader who is intent on changing his country in a fundamental way,” says Christopher Wood, Hong Kong-based strategist for Jefferies, the investment bank, noting that the Nifty index has moved higher since national elections ended on May 19. Foreigners have bought $8bn of stocks since March, when opinion polls suggested a surge of support for the incumbent. But investors should be wary of this seductive story. Mr Modi’s victory comes just as the macro numbers suggest an economy that not only is unable to take advantage of the broken international trading system, but is slowing dramatically after years of dysfunctional policies — many of them from Mr Modi’s own administration. The economy grew at a mere 5.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year, down from the 6.6 per cent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of 2018. Moreover, investment collapsed, falling from 10.6 per cent to 3.6 per cent. Industrial production came in at its lowest level since 2012. Meanwhile, total capital inflows as a percentage of gross domestic product are back to 2002 levels, according to Neelkanth Mishra, India strategist for Credit Suisse. Unlike China, which until recently relied much more on investment than on consumption, consumers in India have always had a penchant for spending. But now both rural and urban consumption has slowed. India may have a large — and young — population but it does not have the income growth to attract steady flows of long-term foreign investment. E-commerce, for example, at 2 per cent of total retail sales, is a fraction of the levels of China. The lack of competitiveness also explains why India is among the most protectionist countries on the planet, ranking third highest, according to Global Trade Alert.
 Since China joined the World Trade Organisation almost 20 years ago it has generated 226m manufacturing jobs, or almost six times as many as India (at 41m), despite its far older population, according to data from Morgan Stanley. India’s manufacturing growth at 3.1 per cent in April was its slowest since the Modi government introduced its disastrous demonetisation policy in November 2016, which invalidated 86 per cent of the cash in circulation. But the main obstacle to India capitalising on the Trump administration’s pressure on East Asia is the country’s woeful infrastructure. The Modi government has made some improvements in building roads and improving the railroads. But the government does not have the money to build and revitalise infrastructure nearly swiftly enough to attract foreign investment in scale. The only notable economic indicator that rose in India in the last quarter was government consumption, which doubled. But that cannot continue indefinitely — only Brazil has a higher ratio of government debt to gross domestic product, according to data from Capital Economics. The National Highway Authority of India has debts of Rp1.5tn ($22bn), for example. Hopes that the private sector and private-public partnerships could take up the burden seem unrealistic. India’s private sector has lost so much money over the past decade building airports, ports and highways — often because government agencies did not pay their bills in a timely fashion — that a high percentage of those infrastructure companies feature prominently in Credit Suisse’s “House of Debt” research, which focuses on firms struggling to service debt from their operating cash flows.  Despite all this, India has long enjoyed a premium valuation to other emerging markets: the MSCI India index is currently trades at about 2.9 times book value, compared to the MSCI EM’s 1.5 times, in line with the five-year average.  Meanwhile, the rupee — one of the best performing emerging-market currencies over the past year — barely moved after the elections. That may in part reflect a widespread view that the Reserve Bank of India will cut rates by another 25 basis points when it meets on Thursday, making a third supportive move in a row at a time when other central banks are either making cuts or leaning towards them. The lack of action in the exchange rate also reflects more bearish market views on other Asian currencies that are vulnerable to trade tensions, including those of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. But given India’s growth outlook, both stocks and the currency look vulnerable from here. henny.sender@ft.com

"FCA official pledges to use criminal powers against dirty money","Enforcement chief Mark Steward flags ‘large number of investigations’","A top official at the UK’s financial watchdog has fired a warning shot to banks by promising to use its criminal powers in cases where City of London firms launder dirty money. Flagging a “large number of investigations”, Mark Steward, the head of enforcement at the Financial Conduct Authority, pledged to use the “full intention” of rules that cover the laundering of ill-gotten gains. These rules were recently enhanced to allow the watchdog to use both its criminal and regulatory powers. His comments come as concern grows that the City of London is acting as a global laundromat, washing hundreds of billions of pounds in dirty money from around the world, according to official estimates. “We have a large number of investigations on foot, some of them entering important phases, tackling some very serious issues, including suspected financial crime in our markets, suspected false or misleading statements by listed issuers, and suspected significant AML system and control issues under the Money Laundering Regulations,” said Mr Steward in a speech at an event on Thursday.  Claire Simm, a managing director at advisory firm Duff & Phelps in London, said: “This is a really strong message here from [Mr] Steward that the FCA is going to prosecute over money laundering and misleading statements.”  “Given the uncertainty in the market over Brexit, having a strong financial regulator has to be important,” she said. “It helps Britain to be seen as a safe place to do business.” The FCA is yet to deploy its criminal money-laundering powers. This has attracted criticism from politicians that the FCA and other enforcement agencies are doing little to tackle the tide of dirty money that floods the UK each year.  Last year the FCA downgraded a high-profile money-laundering case into Credit Suisse and Mozambique’s $2bn “tuna bond” scandal into a regulatory investigation. US prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing their criminal case over the same scandal by seeking to bring charges against three British-based former bankers at Credit Suisse, who are fighting extradition. Large FCA civil fines for lax controls over money-laundering include the £163m levied on Deutsche Bank — which also had to pay $425m to a New York regulator — after investigations into alleged mirror trades used to launder $10bn out of Russia.","05.04.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Vodafone, Purplebricks, Domino’s, Kier, Ferrari","Warm weather puts pressure on Centrica to halve dividend, says HSBC","Tuesday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Vodafone gained after revealing a deal to give Telefónica Deutschland access to its cable network as part of its efforts to gain European Commission antitrust clearance for the acquisition of Liberty Global assets. Terms of the deal were not made public. Goldman called the news “neutral to positive” for Vodafone as it “brings in high-margin wholesale revenues which we believe could offset greater wholesale competition risk”. The news was a modest negative for Deutsche Telekom, which previously had Telefónica’s wholesale business exclusively, Goldman said. Citigroup “buy” advice also helped support Vodafone ahead of results from the group due on May 14. A dividend cut could not be ruled out but would be no surprise, with the shares yielding more than 9 per cent, Citi said. However, its base case was for Vodafone to retain the payout since the annual €4bn cost was “almost covered” by current free cash flow after normalised spectrum licence costs. ● Purplebricks retreated after Michael Bruce, founder and chief executive of the branchless estate agent, stepped down with immediate effect. The company said it was pulling out of Australia and cutting investments in the US to refocus on its core UK operations, along with Canada. Vic Darvey, the former Moneysupermarket executive who was brought in as Purplebricks’ chief operating officer in January, was named as Mr Bruce’s replacement.  “Overall, we see these developments as positive — the de-risking of the portfolio and the reductions in investments into international roll-outs should be taken well. The UK is likely to generate positive [earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation] of £11m this year, more than compensating for losses in Canada and the US.”JPMorgan Cazenove ● Kier led the FTSE 250 fallers on the surprise resignation of its finance director. The company said Bev Dew would leave the construction company by September 30, shortly before full-year results. News of Mr Dew’s departure came less than a month after Andrew Davies took over as chief executive. ● Domino’s Pizza slipped after warning that its international division was likely to miss a previous target of reaching break-even this year. First-quarter UK like-for-like sales improved 3.1 per cent as price increases and bigger orders offset lower volumes, which had been anticipated based on warm weather and caution from peers including Just Eat. But international sales were up just 1.1 per cent as markets in Switzerland, Iceland and Norway all struggled.  Peel Hunt downgraded Domino’s Pizza to “add” from “buy”. It forecast the group’s international arm to lose £6.4m this year, up from its previous estimate of a £1.4m loss. “Domino’s UK business is highly valuable. It is dominant, cash-generative and still offers expansion and efficiency opportunities. It is also in the long-term interests of franchisees to expand and grow like-for-like volumes, even more so than for the company. However, Domino’s track record overseas is not good; if it cannot run these countries profitably, then other master franchisees may think they can do better.”Peel Hunt ● Ferrari rose after its first-quarter profit beat forecasts. Adjusted earnings were up 11 per cent to €232m, easily beating the €210m consensus as demand for the lower priced Portofino model boosted volumes. Nevertheless, margins held steady and unit revenue weakened just 2 per cent to €282,000 thanks in part to limited-edition special models. Management reiterated full-year targets. “Note that mix/price has been an important driver for the equity story since Ferrari’s [flotation]. Yet, today we believe investors will be pleased to see a solid margin evolution against known weaker mix.”Goldman Sachs Sellside stories ● HSBC downgraded Centrica to “reduce” from “hold” with a 90p target price. It argued that the British Gas owner should cut its annual dividend by 50 per cent to 6p.  Consensus forecasts suggest Centrica will cut its payout by 25 per cent to 9p at interim results in July. Such a level would still be too high for a commoditised utility, leaving insufficient earnings and cash flow headroom particularly after mild weather in the first quarter, said HSBC. ● Stifel turned negative on the UK-listed industrial distribution companies to reflect “a less aggressive view of the sustainability and robustness of economic prospects”. DCC, Bunzl, Ferguson, Essentra, DiscoverIE, Electrocomponents were all downgraded to “hold” from “buy”.  “The [economic] cycle is long in the tooth, but we expect supportive end markets throughout the second half 2019 even as we expect a transition to a lower growth environment. Beyond that, the picture is more uncertain . . . We expect share price risk to remain exaggerated as the market continues to be trigger happy to [the] first circumstantial evidence of cyclical risks. In other words, with high valuations across our industrial distribution group, there is little room for error in risk-volatile equity markets.”Stifel ● In brief: 4imprint cut to “add” at Peel Hunt, downgraded to “hold” at Liberum and rated new “overweight” at Barclays; Acacia Mining raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Boliden cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Cembra Money Bank cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Cosmo raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Deutsche Post cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Eni downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Gecina cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Hochtief raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Mapfre upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Partners Group rated new “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Persimmon raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Piovan raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Reckitt Benckiser upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; SBM Offshore raised to “overweight” at Barclays; Sabadell upgraded to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Scout24 cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Swiss Re cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Tele2 raised to “buy” at HSBC; Total downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Umicore cut to “hold” at Berenberg.

"The Saudi Aramco IPO is coming . . . eventually","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Flashback. September 4 edition of the DD newsletter in your inbox. Headline: The 
Aramco IPO is happening! Maybe. Actually, TBD Since then, there has been incessant news about plans for the world’s largest oil company to list its shares in its home market of Saudi Arabia. The who’s who of Wall Street have signed up to bring to market a company that we are told prints money like no one else. This isn’t WeWork. And yet . . . Saudi Aramco has postponed the launch of its long-awaited initial public offering, due on Sunday, three people familiar with the matter said, putting the planned November flotation in jeopardy.  That’s the latest exclusive reporting from the FT’s Anjli Raval and our team, which you can read here.   More than three years since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman disclosed his ambitions to bring his company to market, we’re still waiting. We won’t repeat all the crazy stuff the bankers on the deal have had to endure, but we have to imagine they’re getting exhausted . . . To get more on who they are, read this Bloomberg write-up of the A-list bankers on the deal, which is sort of flattering if you are the type of person who wants credit for working on the world’s largest IPO and doesn’t mind the troubling political backdrop in Saudi Arabia or the unusual bookbuilding efforts. But for all their might, Wall Street’s brightest can’t seem to get the Aramco IPO off the ground as quickly as kingdom officials would like.  The company was meant to formally announce its intention to float this Sunday. With this now delayed by “weeks” as one person put it, the November listing could be in jeopardy.   Another person familiar with the matter shot down the idea of a delay, saying there was never a set timeline. Any hold-up, he said, was to give investors more clarity about third-quarter results, particularly following the attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure last month that halved the country’s production temporarily.  This might indicate that the company is having trouble securing the $2tn valuation sought after by Prince Mohammed. Even as local banks are raving about enthusiasm from Saudi investors, foreign institutions are not so sure.  A November listing was always ambitious. When Prince Mohammed revived plans for the listing over the summer after it was put on hold last year, bankers said the first quarter of 2020 was more likely if things went full steam ahead.  Then again, don’t be surprised if we find ourselves back in this endless on-again, off-again situation.  Hong Kong has a disappearing cash problem  Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam says the city has slipped into recession after more than four months of violent protests and political unrest. But an economic downturn might be the least of her worries if cash continues to disappear from local bank accounts, only to reappear in rival financial hub Singapore. That seems to be what’s happening. Wealthy Hong Kong clients at UBS, HSBC, Pictet and Credit Suisse are opening overseas bank accounts at a rapid rate as the protests intensify, according to senior executives from the banks.  One executive said they’ve even warned Lam about the trend and the risk that capital flight will pick up if the unrest doesn’t subside. Here’s the FT story on the matter. Some of the cash is heading to Singapore, a city-state with fewer protections on free speech compared to Hong Kong, but also a place that has in the past stealthily advertised to Chinese overseas that it is out of the reach of the Chinese government.  Hong Kong is less and less able to make a convincing argument on that point. Among clients with accounts that range from S$1m-S$2m ($730,000-$1.4m), one executive at a Singaporean bank said more accounts have been opened over the past three months than ever before.  Three months ago the bank was receiving about 80 applications a month to open accounts from a variety of clients. In August, the bank received 400 applications to open accounts. With no end in sight for the Hong Kong protests (read this FT Magazine piece for the best reporting on the topic), one can only expect more cash to evaporate from the territory’s accounts in the near future. IPO 2.O: Investors want direct listings to be able to raise cash IPOs have faced much talk of “disruption” from Silicon Valley lately. Look no further than the dozens of venture capitalists and tech companies that gathered this month to discuss direct listings, where companies distribute existing shares to public investors while sidestepping a traditional IPO. Now some direct listing proponents want to open the process used by Slack and Spotify to allow for raising new capital — and they’ve taken their arguments to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, DD’s Miles Kruppa reports.  Representatives from Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq stock exchange and law firm Latham & Watkins recently pitched the idea to SEC officials, including its division of corporation finance director William Hinman.  Also in attendance was Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford University law professor and former SEC commissioner who has publicly backed the idea. It’s still unclear how exactly companies would use direct listings to raise new capital. Some have said the process could resemble at-the-market follow-on offerings, where issuers dribble out new shares to public market bidders without a bank underwriting process. Formal proposals could be months away, and it’s unlikely any company would attempt the manoeuvre without SEC approval. But if and when the day comes, the new-style direct listing could present a more fulsome case for competing with traditional IPOs.

"Mistakes to avoid when investing in Middle East and north Africa ","Ignoring Silicon Valley ‘myths’ key to success in region undeserving of hefty risk premium","The Middle East and north Africa (Mena) region is infamous among foreign investors for being difficult to understand. This lack of comprehension has created a risk premium far in excess of what is necessary for the region, leading to higher returns for informed investors. The first mistake is to assume that Mena, a collection of 20 or so countries, is homogeneous. Although most people in Mena identify as Arabs and possess shared traits — which lead to a larger market — the cultural and economic differences around the region are substantial. While these differences create diversification opportunities, it also means that, for example, hiring an investment analyst from the Levant to analyse the Gulf states will not create any more value than hiring someone who grew up in Britain. The second mistake is to misunderstand communication, which in the Arabic speaking world is relatively indirect and more non-verbal than the Anglo-Saxon style. The divide is marked in the Mena region because foreigners often confuse fluency in language with compatibility in communications.  Speaking generally, Arabs do not like to use the word “no” but that does not mean that they do not say “no”. The failure to grasp such nuances has broken the careers of many foreign businesspeople in the region. Hiring an investment analyst from the Levant to analyse the Gulf states will not create any more value than hiring someone who grew up in BritainSabah al-Binali In 2001, I was the lead founder of Saffar Capital, a Mena private equity group. Our first investment, driven largely by the insights already mentioned, was a finance media company. The investment was successful mainly because we did not adopt the Silicon Valley myths that are now being imported into Mena and which hobble local start-ups and destroy investment value. The first myth we ignored was that we needed local entrepreneurs. Zawya, our investment, was founded by British citizens of Iraqi descent and based in London. However, we immediately moved the company and its five full-time employees to Dubai and ensured that our investment group — with its deep knowledge of Mena — complemented Zawya’s founder team. We broke a second taboo by refusing to allow the founders to manage the company whilst controlling the votes. The idea that an entrepreneur can maintain equity control of their company exists in the US only because the supply of investment far outstrips the demand. In much of the rest of the world the opposite is true, and Mena entrepreneurs trying to keep control of their companies and fund them externally will find there is little appetite for that approach from local investors. The third myth we sidestepped concerned the idea of trying to solve a regional problem. That is self-limiting. The problem we solved was global: how foreigners perceived and digested Mena financial news and data. Instead of seeing the region’s often volatile news events as a challenge, we exploited them as an opportunity.  By using an online platform, we sidestepped many of the regulatory problems that a physical presence such as local offices and production would have faced. Other start-ups such as Maktoob (bought by Yahoo), Souq (bought by Amazon) and Careem (bought by Uber) also used digital platforms to overcome the multi-jurisdictional issues of Mena. The fourth taboo we broke was being commercially driven rather than emotionally passionate. Again, you can be passionate if investment demand far outstrips supply, but when this is not the case, entrepreneurs must think commercially. We also focused on margin growth as a key indicator of performance, rather than revenue growth.  The fifth taboo is location. Entrepreneurs are too enamoured of being “where it’s happening”. In Dubai in 2002, this meant the hubs of Dubai Internet City and Dubai Media City. We instead chose to set up in Deira, the old town, for less than one-third of what it would have cost in one of the hubs. Our research team, comprising three-quarters of Zawya’s employees, were based in Beirut, where skilled, educated, hardworking professionals are abundant and reasonably remunerated. The sixth taboo is the timeline. In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs may be able to generate investor returns in a few years. It took six years for Careem to exit, 10 years for Maktoob and 12 years for Souq. It took us 11 years to build Zawya and sell it to Thomson Reuters. We generated a 35 per cent cash internal rate of return — a closely watched measure of performance — on Zawya over those 11 years. We made our investment in November 2001, right after the September 11 2001 terror attacks that sent the Mena equity risk premium skyrocketing.  We did not invent anything new, we simply executed better than our competitors, including global giants. In 2004, we used the same principles to build a Saudi investment bank and later sell it to Credit Suisse. The main challenges to venture capital investing in Mena are not a dearth of funding and skilled employees, but simply overcoming a lack of regional expertise.

"Scor steps up attacks on rival as French insurance spat turns nasty","Reinsurer publishes documents it says show foul play in Covéa’s takeover bid","Scor, the French reinsurer, has published documents that it forced Credit Suisse to hand over in an effort to expose alleged foul play behind a takeover bid that opened up a bitter feud in France’s insurance industry.  The dispute has put the spotlight on investment bankers at Barclays and Rothschild, which are being sued by Scor over their handling of information in an attempt to engineer a controversial takeover of the French reinsurer by a rival. The documents, some of which were included in a court filing in Paris this week and published on Scor’s website, show that Credit Suisse was asked last July for ideas that would “kill” a rival deal.  The disclosure shed light on the acrimonious fight that pits Denis Kessler, Scor’s longstanding chief executive, against Thierry Derez, CEO of the French mutual insurer Covéa which, until Tuesday, had said it wanted to buy Scor. The filings show that last month Scor took legal action in the UK High Court against Credit Suisse — which was advising Covéa until it pulled out in November — to force it to hand over documents relating to the deal.  Scor has been battling interest from Covéa since August. Covéa already owns an 8 per cent stake in the reinsurer and Mr Derez was on the Scor board until last November.  Scor said on Tuesday that it was taking legal action against Mr Derez and Covéa, along with Barclays and Rothschild which were advising the mutual.  The reinsurer alleges that Mr Derez used confidential information that had been given to him as a director of Scor — including details of a potential merger with a rival — in order to further Covéa’s efforts to buy the company.  After a board meeting on Wednesday, Covéa said: “After thorough examination, Covéa’s board of directors firmly rejects all the groundless accusations made by Scor and reaffirms its unanimous support to Thierry Derez and his action. Covéa will take all action in order to defend its interests in view of the serious reputational harm resulting from Scor’s unacceptable accusations, which are undoubtedly part of a strategy to manipulate the judicial process.”  Scor on Tuesday published court filings containing more details of its allegations. It claims that Mr Derez told his advisers about Scor’s confidential plans last year to merge with PartnerRe — a rival deal to the one that Covéa was preparing.  Those documents include internal Credit Suisse emails which suggest that Mr Derez asked the bank to prepare arguments against the Scor/Partner Re combination that could be used to “kill” the potential deal.  They also include a message that Scor said came from Mr Derez’s assistant to bankers at Barclays, which included minutes of a July meeting of the strategic committee of Scor’s board of directors. Barclays subsequently forwarded the message to Credit Suisse and Rothschild.  Barclays, Credit Suisse and Rothschild have declined to comment. ","30.01.2019"
"Opening Quote: Betting group GVC bets on US expansion amid UK decline","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email. GVC, the owner of betting shop chain Ladbrokes Coral, reported double digit online growth as it seeks to offset a sharp fall in revenue from its UK retail arm. The gambling group said that revenue from its online operations was up 18 per cent — in constant currency terms — in the year to the end of June, despite strong comparatives from last year’s football World Cup. Revenues from its UK betting shops dropped 10 per cent in the same period, however, following a cut to the maximum stake permitted on fixed odd betting terminals, which are a kind of electronic slot machine. GVC, which has previously said it is likely to close 1,000 shops in the UK, is not the only bookmaker finding the high street a tough place to do business. Rival bookmaking chain William Hill announced earlier this month that it would shut 700 betting shops, affecting 4,500 jobs.  Kenny Alexander, chief executive of GVC, is looking to the US for future growth. He said the company’s joint venture with casino group MGM Resorts, was “on track” for a full online launch ahead of the NFL season in September. He added that GVC had also been granted licences to operate in Mississippi, Nevada and New Jersey.  British gambling groups have looked to expand into the US, where sports betting was made legal at a federal level in May last year. Flutter Entertainment (previously Paddy Power Betfair) has teamed up with the fantasy sports site FanDuel to offer sports betting, while William Hill has a deal with El Dorado resorts. Bet 365 is also due to launch a betting platform in New Jersey in conjunction with Hard Rock in September. Investors will be hoping the sector’s bet on the US pays off. Briefly  On Tuesday we brought you an interview with Bill Winters in which the Standard Chartered chief executive branded investors “immature” for protesting against his pay. On Wednesday, shareholders hit back. One big asset manager described the chief executive as “tin eared”. Another said: “As an immature investor, I’m going to not make any rash comments, but look forward to the fallout coming.” Read more on this escalating row here. Bidders are circling for Four Seasons, Britain’s second biggest care home chain. But the business, which houses 16,000 elderly residents, could be sold for as little as £400m, half the price it fetched when it was sold to Guy Hands’ Terra Firma seven years ago. One of the bidders is H2 Capital Partners, the US hedge fund that is the business’s largest creditor. Cheyne Capital, the second biggest bondholder, and Davidson Kempner Capital Management, a Texas-based fund that is one of the company’s landlords, are also interested. Read more.

 Beyond the Square Mile   An Elon Musk-backed company seeking to build a brain-machine interface has unveiled its first products. Neuralink intends to insert proprietary chips and information strips called “threads” into people’s brains that can then be controlled via an iPhone app. Executives said their initial plan was to help patients with severe brain disorders but that the ultimate goal was to allow humans to achieve “a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. Facebook had repeatedly broken the public’s trust and should not be trusted to run a digital currency said Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Senate banking committee. He likened the social media group to “a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches” in the first of two Congressional hearings into Facebook’s new digital currency, dubbed Project Libra. But David Marcus, the co-creator of Libra and former PayPal executive, said Facebook would not launch the currency until it had regulatory approval. Goldman Sachs stood out from its rivals by trumpeting a rebound in equity trading in the first quarter, helping the Wall Street bank to outstrip analysts’ expectations.

"UniCredit leads trio of European lenders alarmed by low rates","Germany’s Commerzbank and Dutch lender ABN Amro also warn of testing backdrop","Large European banks lined up on Wednesday to warn that the low interest rate environment would hurt their earnings, wiping hundreds of millions of euros off their market valuations.  UniCredit, Italy’s second-largest bank by market capitalisation, cut its revenue forecast for this year to €18.7bn from €19bn due to what chief executive Jean Pierre Mustier described as the “prevailing environment, with rates expected to be lower for much longer”. Commerzbank, the German lender, warned that its profit target for 2019 was now looking “significantly more ambitious”, noting that leading central banks had “tempered their interest rate . . . expectations” because of a darkening economic outlook. Meanwhile, ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, said that low interest rates would hit its net interest income, the amount it earns on lending minus its financing costs, owing to lower deposit margins. “The second-quarter earnings season for European banks has been largely disappointing,” said Ronit Ghose, an analyst at Citi. “Many banks have undershot revenue forecasts. Bearish outlook guidance, especially on net interest income, has reflected an increasingly negative interest rate environment.” The warnings from some of Europe’s largest lenders underscored how global banks are scrambling to position their businesses for a “lower for longer” interest rate environment.  Central banks in Europe, the US and the UK have either cut or are poised to cut interest rates to support the global economy at a time of escalating geopolitical turmoil, including trade tensions between China and the West and the growing prospect of a hard Brexit.  Central bankers in India, Thailand and New Zealand also cut interest rates by more than markets had expected on Wednesday in a bid to boost growth in their economies.  Shares in the trio of European lenders — which all reported first-half results on Wednesday — were lower in early afternoon trading, equating to a reduction of more than €840m in their combined market capitalisation. Record-low interest rates are already weighing on banks’ profits as they have been forced to lower borrowing charges and in some cases pay to store money at central banks, without a similar reduction in the rates they pay to savers. Until recently, many eurozone lenders had been hoping that the European Central Bank would increase interest rates for the first time in half a decade, leading to a recovery in the income they generate by lending to consumers and businesses.  But now the ECB is expected to cut its deposit rate from minus 0.4 per cent to minus 0.5 per cent next month — with some economists predicting that the central bank will go further in loosening monetary policy.  “As client rates are close to zero, it will be increasingly difficult to offset the decline and over time margin pressure will increase further,” warned Kees van Dijkhuizen, the outgoing chief executive of ABN.  The warnings from some of Europe’s largest lenders echoed similar concerns at banks in the US, where the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month, and the UK, where the Bank of England is expected to do the same.  Until now, most large European banks have refrained from passing on the cost of negative interest rates to individual clients, although some have implemented charges for corporate customers.  But last week the Financial Times revealed that UBS, the Swiss bank, was preparing to levy a negative interest rate on wealthy clients with cash deposits of more than SFr2m, and Credit Suisse, its main rival, said it was considering following suit.  Ralph Hamers, the chief executive of ING, ABN Amro’s larger rival, recently launched an unusually outspoken attack on the ECB’s negative interest rate policy, which he suggested was backfiring.  “I actually see that the negative rate environment is making consumers so uncertain about their financial environment that they’re starting to save more rather than less,” he said.","07.08.2019"
"Gupta completes deal for European assets of Arcelor","Acquisition turns businessman’s Liberty subsidiary into one of the largest steelmakers","Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Steel has completed its €740m acquisition of ArcelorMittal’s European assets, the company’s largest deal since the businessman started buying up distressed steelworks four years ago.  The deal turns Liberty, the industrial and metals company founded in the UK by Mr Gupta, into one of the largest steelmakers globally after an aggressive buying spree. Liberty’s rapid expansion through rampant dealmaking has prompted concerns over the group’s pace of growth. It now owns seven major steelworks employing 14,000 people that supply steel to Europe’s largest industries from aerospace to automotive.  The ArcelorMittal steel mills have a rolling capacity of more than 10m tonnes a year and Liberty aims to boost sales by 50 per cent over the next three years, the company said.  Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance, which owns Liberty, has also been snapping up factories, smelters and mines round the world. It now has nearly 30,000 workers across 30 countries.  “These are big assets for us, but they’re small for ArcelorMittal. We can devote more time and energy to them to make them work harder,” Jay Hambro, chief investment officer at the GFG Alliance, told the Financial Times. “These businesses move us up the scale to being a proper global contender.” GFG, while it is still private, is considering a stock market listing for its steel business in the US and has hired Credit Suisse, Mr Hambro said. “We are considering options with regards to that business in bringing it to the market,” he said.  Liberty received approval from the EU to acquire the ArcelorMittal assets in April after the European Commission found that Liberty was a suitable purchaser and that the transaction raised no competition issues.  Authorities had initially been concerned that the deal was “highly dependent on borrowed money”. But in the end they were convinced by Liberty’s offer to contribute a higher amount of equity to reduce the debt level. The deal will allow Liberty to supply a full range of finished steel products including plate and hot rolled coil.  “These businesses will form a key part of our global steel strategy, of building a sustainable steel business, with a fully integrated value chain, from raw materials to high-value finished products that are distributed in high quality markets,” Mr Gupta said.   The facilities are being sold by ArcelorMittal in exchange for Brussels’ blessing for its own €1.8bn acquisition of the Italian steel business Ilva. They include the integrated steelworks at Ostrava in the Czech Republic, Galati in Romania as well as rolling mills in north Macedonia, Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium. The service centres are based in France and Italy.  Liberty Steel was advised by Wyelands Capital, another subsidiary and financial arm of Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance, as well as by Jefferies International. ","01.07.2019"
"George Osborne’s pensions trickery has backfired in boardrooms","Tax reforms have made companies more likely to pay larger sums of cash in lieu of pensions","In the spat that flared last week between Standard Chartered chief executive Bill Winters and some of his top investors, it is easy to apportion blame. Mr Winters should not have lashed out at “immature” shareholders who had criticised the generosity of his £474,000-a-year pension arrangements. And investors should perhaps have shown greater understanding of his contractual pay entitlements. An American banker, whose peers in the US typically earn twice what he does, might at some point conclude that continuing as boss of a British bank is not worth the candle. Either way, the result is that a well respected banker has been dragged into a growing mire. He joins Andrea Orcel, the ex-UBS banker who is suing would-be new employer Santander for €100m over an alleged breach of contract, and Credit Suisse, which last week lost a legal battle with the UK government over a financial crisis era tax on bonuses. Though Mr Winters also signalled a readiness to debate “whether executive pay is too high”, his defence of his generous pension has made him appear to inhabit a parallel universe. As this column highlighted a fortnight ago, it is not a good look. The only winners are social injustice campaigners. To the credit of UK institutional investors and policymakers, this was precisely the issue they have been trying to head off over the past year or so. When the corporate governance code was tweaked last year to urge companies to bring executive pay structures more into line with those of their staff, the case was taken up by the Investment Association, the trade body for institutional shareholders. Executive pension contributions should not exceed 25 per cent, the IA said, and in time should be aligned with the contribution rate for all staff. We are a long way from that aspiration. According to a report published in May by consultants LCP, about half of the FTSE 100 pay their chief executives a pension contribution that is more than 25 per cent of their salary. Nearly nine in 10 of them receives a higher percentage contribution than their staff. The IA praises the likes of HSBC and Aviva, which have taken decisive moves to narrow the gap, and Morgan Sindall, a construction services business, which has capped its executive pension contributions at 10 per cent of salary, equivalent to the maximum available to other staff. For the time being at least, such alignment is rare. Company remuneration committees must accept a large part of the blame for this. As more constraints have been placed on bonus schemes following investor campaigns, they have allowed pensions to balloon. But a share of fault also lies with the government, and in particular with former chancellor George Osborne. Hospital doctors have been complaining in recent weeks about the meanness and absurd complexity of restructured pensions tax relief, which is limited to £40,000 of pension contributions, falling to £10,000 once you earn between £150,000 and £210,000. The lifetime limit on your pension pot has also been reduced to barely £1m. Medics probably elicit more public sympathy but a similar dynamic has played out among senior corporate executives. If you earn a few million a year, and have some expectation of maintaining a similar standard of living post-retirement, a £10,000-a-year pension allocation is pretty ineffectual. But what looked like a canny political trick by Mr Osborne, cutting tax giveaways and cracking down simultaneously on fat cat executives, backfired spectacularly. Companies began allocating cash allowances instead of pension contributions. As bonuses came under greater scrutiny, the amounts distributed to CEOs as cash in lieu of pensions spiralled to a FTSE 100 average of 25 per cent. An actuary might point out that 25 per cent of salary is less than might be expected when measured against more opaque old-style defined benefit pensions, which entitled a typical beneficiary — from CEO to security guard — to an income equivalent to two-thirds of their salary on retirement. In today’s world of longer life expectancy and lower investment returns, a contribution of more like 50 per cent of salary would be needed for that kind of pension income. Of course companies could offset any sense of injustice by extending the same kind of benefit to all staff. But shareholders might have something to say about that. patrick.jenkins@ft.com

"Australia’s Lendlease signs deal to develop Google’s US properties","Developer says partnership for Bay Area projects could be worth up to $15bn","Lendlease, one of Australia’s biggest construction companies, has extended its relationship with Google after it signed a deal that would see tracts of land in California redeveloped into housing and office space. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Thursday, Sydney-based Lendlease said that it and the Silicon Valley company would redevelop Google’s landholdings near its headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, including building 15,000 new homes.   Lendlease shares rose as much as 5.3 per cent in morning trading in Sydney on Thursday following the news, taking the developer’s stock to its highest point since September last year. The announcement comes after Google last month vowed to contribute $1bn over the next decade to help alleviate housing shortages, including redeveloping land it owns, amid complaints from activists that tech companies have made the area unaffordable and pushed out lower-paid workers. It also marks another partnership between Google and Lendlease, that extends back to aborted plans to move the search engine’s Australian head office to a disused power station in Sydney. That plan was scrapped in 2017. This . . . will help address the need for new housing in the San Francisco Bay AreaDenis Hickey, Lendlease Americas Also in 2017, Google chose Lendlease to build its new European headquarters in London on disused land next to King's Cross station, set for completion in 2021.  The projects with Google in the Bay Area will include 15m square feet of new “mixed-use” neighbourhoods featuring 15,000 new homes, as well as office, retail and hospitality developments in San Jose, Sunnyvale and Mountain View. “This new joint agreement between Google and Lendlease will help address the need for new housing in the San Francisco Bay Area,” said Denis Hickey, chief executive of Lendlease Americas. A low-cost housing component of the project has not yet been specified, but a person familiar with the matter said one could materialise as plans progress. Lendlease said the total value of the deal is about $15bn and it will take about 10 to 15 years to complete. Work is expected to start in 2021. The Australian company is deepening its presence in the US amid a slowdown in the domestic property market. It has in recent years built several high-rise, luxury apartment complexes in New York City. The Google deal alone will more than triple its US project pipeline, according to Morningstar analyst Shaun Ler. The “US is a small but growing earnings contributor to the group”, he said. “This deal should help the business scale.”  At $15bn, the project is Lendlease’s biggest ever and it could provide a significant boost to earnings long-term, analysts said. Lendlease’s net profits after tax plunged by 96 per cent in the first half of its financial year.  “Whilst difficult to be more precise and Lendlease may only capture a portion of this depending upon structure, the opportunity is clearly large,” said Rob Freeman, an analyst at Macquarie. Paul Butler, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Lendlease could expect a profit margin of 20-25 per cent on the Google developments. That would add A$5.5bn ($3.9bn) to Lendlease’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the project’s lifespan, Mr Butler added.","18.07.2019"
"US gasoline prices rise after blasts at Philadelphia refinery","Explosions shake buildings as far away as southern New Jersey, TV reports say","US gasoline prices jumped after a large fire and explosions were reported at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery, the largest on the Atlantic coast.  Wholesale gasoline futures for delivery into New York harbour next month were up 3.9 per cent on Friday at $1.86 a gallon, outstripping gains in crude oil, which was up 0.9 per cent.  The refinery dates to Pennsylvania’s 19th-century oil boom and lies less than a mile from residential areas of South Philadelphia. City emergency responders reported a vat of butane had exploded on-site shortly after 4am on Friday, but reported no injuries. The company did not respond to requests for comment.  Local television said a series of large explosions shook buildings as far away as southern New Jersey, across the Delaware river. The NBC broadcast affiliate said thick plumes of smoke were covering large parts of “centre city and South Philadelphia”.  The river basin between Pennsylvania and New Jersey is the main oil refining centre on the US east coast and an important market for crude oil produced abroad. The Philadelphia refinery, which is able to process as much as 335,000 barrels of oil a day, imports large amounts of crude from North Sea and west African suppliers, including Norway, the UK and Nigeria, government data show.  PES previously spent $130m to build a railway yard to unload oil trains from the Bakken oil formation in North Dakota, but shipments from the Midwest to the east coast have fallen after new pipelines made it cheaper to send barrels to competing refineries in the central US.  The refineries in the greater Philadelphia region — including PES, PBF Energy’s Paulsboro, New Jersey plant and the Trainer refinery owned by a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines — supply large eastern gasoline, diesel and jet fuel markets including Philadelphia, Washington and New York City.  The Philadelphia refinery was almost shut before being saved in 2012 by the private equity investor Carlyle Group, which formed a joint venture with former owner Sunoco, helped by tax and regulatory relief and $25m in grants from Pennsylvania. The PES holding company then filed for bankruptcy protection in 2018
, enabling it to shed costly ethanol blending obligations in a controversial settlement with regulators.  The parent company emerged from bankruptcy in August 2018 controlled by investors Credit Suisse Asset Management and Bardin Hill, with the prior joint venture owners retaining minority stakes.*  *This story has been amended to correct the names of the refinery’s current owners.

"Deutsche Bank: kaput option","CEO’s masterstroke was to set out the inverse of former chief’s grand vision","“It is different this time,” promised Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank’s chief executive. Plenty of grand plans have gone kaput at the German lender since predecessor Alfred Herrhausen imagined Deutsche as a global bank in 1989, shortly after the Berlin Wall fell. As Mr Sewing spoke, many Deutsche staff were having a Lehman moment. They were preparing for redundancy as their employer crashed out of full-service investment banking, albeit in better shape than the defunct Wall Street business.  Mr Sewing’s masterstroke was to set out the inverse of Herrhausen’s grand vision. If he succeeds, a downsized Deutsche, toiling humbly for German industrial workhorses, will produce returns on tangible equity in 2022 of just 8 per cent. That would be below European peers, Deutsche’s cost of capital and its previous 10 per cent target, though the latter depended on higher rates. Mr Sewing has little choice. German retail banking margins are wafer thin, due to low interest rates and the Sparkassen, municipality-owned savings banks. Funds arm DWS makes 18 per cent returns but is threatened by big rivals and passive investing. European investment banking, meanwhile, is in structural decline. It will still drag on profitability. Mr Sewing wants to slash the share of risk-weighted assets allocated to Deutsche’s unit from 60 per cent to nearer a third, in line with rivals such as UBS.   The closest Mr Sewing gets to the vision thing is a “corporate bank” acting for large Europe-based multinationals. That will yield less than a quarter of revenues, however.  Deutsche’s excessive costs are rightly being tackled. Creating a “bad bank” to run off legal assets worked well at rival Credit Suisse and previously at Deutsche, too. Mr Sewing’s plan, envisages revenues growing at just 2 per cent a year. Even that is ambitious, when downsizing will cut businesses such as equity trading with a tenth of revenues.  Deutsche shares, down another 5 per cent on Monday, trade at just 0.25 times tangible book value, at the bottom of the European league. Europe’s increasing nationalist politics protect Deutsche against break-up or takeover. Regulators have agreed lower capital strength targets. Another capital increase may yet be needed. Mr Sewing hopes that by under promising, he can over deliver. For Deutsche, that would not just be different. It would be a complete reversal of recent fortunes.

"Is UBS losing its edge in investment banking?","Shorn of its hard-driving leader Andrea Orcel, the business has suffered a drop in profits","This time last year Sergio Ermotti was riding high. The UBS chief executive was basking in a double-digit jump in quarterly profit and boasting of the bank’s “excellent” prospects. His decision six years earlier to refocus on wealth management and slim down the investment bank looked to be paying off — the model he pioneered was copied by Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.  A year on and the narrative is very different. Over the rest of 2018 the stock plunged 30 per cent as steep swings in markets caught traders off guard and convinced ultra-rich clients to keep their cash on the sidelines.  The past two quarters have produced dramatic declines in earnings at the investment bank and world-leading $2.4tn wealth management unit. In response, Mr Ermotti has put the bank in what he calls “fuel saving” mode — freezing hiring, slashing bonuses and delaying spending on technology projects. On top of this, a gamble to go to court and fight accusations of tax evasion in France backfired in February when a judge slapped UBS with a record €4.5bn fine, which led to a shareholder revolt against executives at its annual meeting this month.  Analysts at Barclays now say “a more significant overhaul of strategy may be warranted” after a “material downgrade” to expectations since the last strategic update in October, when executives stuck to essentially the same course.  “Many investors we speak to believe UBS should be able to achieve higher returns, and have been frustrated for some time in this regard,” said Barclays’ Amit Goel. “It is worth reassessing whether one-third [of assets] is the right resource allocation to the investment bank and if the group should target ultra-high net worth clients as aggressively” considering how expensive they are to acquire and service.   UBS now trades at a 20 per cent discount to the book value of its assets, compared to a 50 per cent premium at smaller Swiss rival Julius Baer, which does not court multi-billionaire clients as aggressively or run a large investment bank. Bigger US rivals such as JPMorgan Chase trade at an even higher multiple.  Tone from the top Some insiders say UBS has lost its edge since the shock departure of Andrea Orcel as head of its investment bank. The notoriously hard-charging Italian dominated the unit for six years until he quit last September to become CEO of Santander, only for this to fall through after disputes over his pay and profile.  “We’ve had two terrible quarters and we could have done with Andrea here,” said one UBS banker. “He had his hands around 10,000 throats . . . I’m not as ‘on it’ as I was when he was here; I was terrified before. He’s very difficult to replicate.” But supporters of Mr Orcel’s replacements — M&A banker Piero Novelli and equity trader Robert Karofsky — say it would be wrong to interpret the arrival of a kinder, more consensual culture at the investment bank as a lack of focus.  They argue that while Mr Orcel’s more intense attitude might have made sense in the past, it hurt morale and since he left resignations in the advisory and capital markets unit have halved. “The first thing Piero and Rob did was to change the culture in the investment bank, which historically had contributed to attrition in the advisory business,” said one senior executive. “They are moving from a top down, hard-charging, just for the sake of it attitude to one of partnership, ownership and accountability. It’s the right move for this phase of the bank.” A sharp drop-off Still, the recent drop-off in performance is stark and executives are debating deeper cuts in the wobbling investment bank. The unit made a surprise $47m loss in the fourth quarter and pre-tax profit plunged 64 per cent in the first three months of 2019, which Mr Ermotti blamed on the “worst first-quarter environment in recent history” and a tough comparison with the stellar start to 2018.  Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, described the start of the year as  the “worst first-quarter environment in recent history” for investment banking © Bloomberg Despite being shrunk back to a supporting role, the investment bank still accounts for a third of the group’s $268bn of risk-weighted assets — more than wealth and asset management combined — despite making only a 6.8 per cent return on equity in the first quarter, down from 16 per cent last year. That compares with 30 per cent returns in both wealth management and personal and corporate banking. “Our investment bank has been returning its cost of capital and is integral to wealth management and the corporate business in Switzerland,” said chief financial officer Kirt Gardner. “Without it we wouldn’t have our ultra-business serving sophisticated family offices.”  Ominously, the steepest first-quarter falls came in the bank’s traditional strongholds of equity trading, where profits dropped 22 per cent, and capital markets and merger advisory, where it dropped 48 per cent. The latter was far worse than rivals.  “UBS is not a US giant with a huge balance sheet and a large product suite,” said one person involved in setting strategy. “The only way you win is by running faster, riding the organisation hard, taking decisions fast and getting it tight like a tambourine.  “They have stopped putting pressure on the organisation, there is a lack of relentless drive,” the person said, referring to the mood since Mr Orcel left.  The missed opportunity Internally, critics say some of the pain could have been avoided. Anticipating a downturn in markets, last autumn UBS executives had drawn up plans to reshape the division and preemptively reduce expenses. But they decided against it, two people involved in the process said.  “By not taking decisive action when we should have we’ve now spent all of the first quarter debating cuts, not driving the business,” one of the people said.  Mr Ermotti, 58-years-old and now in his eighth year in charge, has started to take remedial action and has promised more if things do not improve. He partially offset the 27 per cent drop in first-quarter investment banking revenue by cutting expenses 14 per cent, largely through a $372m reduction in the bonus pool. Nevertheless, the ratio of costs to revenues still rose to 86 per cent, its highest in years.  “We have to balance matching pay to performance, whilst not damaging the franchise by losing our best people,” said a UBS executive. “But there is a major structural problem in the industry because pay hasn’t come down to the same extent as the revenue pool. That’s not sustainable.”  UBS's investment bank has suffered a decline in its performance since Andrea Orcel quit as  the unit's head last September to become CEO of Santander, only for the move to collapse a few months later © Bloomberg However, shareholders are still annoyed by a lack of cost discipline. An example of this frustration came after UBS reopened its refurbished century-old headquarters on Zurich’s Bahnhofstrasse in December.  “We have this giant new board room with a huge table, perhaps the highest ceiling I’ve ever seen — all very intimidating — with massive TVs on the walls,” said one managing director. “When some investors came in and saw it they thought: ‘What cost cuts?’” UBS said it has “not held meetings with shareholders in the boardroom”. More trimming required The fresh cost-cutting plan Mr Novelli and Mr Karofsky are reviewing is characterised as “more fine-tuning” rather than “radical overhaul” by one executive involved.  An early move came last month when UBS restructured its US unit, merging the capital markets teams and wealth units in an attempt to sell more investment banking products to early-stage entrepreneurs and ultra-rich American clients. It also aims to attract $70bn of new money for its US wealth unit over the next three years.  This is based on the success of arch-rival Credit Suisse’s “international trading solutions” unit, which was created last year to improve cross-selling of complex structured finance products to big family offices.  UBS is considering extending this cross-selling drive — known internally as the “Lexington” project — from the US to Europe and Asia, one person said.   Mr Ermotti has argued the bank’s problems stem from the climate of political and economic uncertainty that is weighing on market activity and hurting many banks. UBS said rich Asian clients are keeping a near-record 36 per cent of their assets in cash, spooked by US President Donald Trump’s escalation of his trade war with China, while eurozone interest rates are still negative and Brexit remains in limbo.  “We are not a sleepy organisation, nobody panics when the model adapts,” said George Athanasopoulos, head of currency, rates and credit trading at UBS. “I have been in fuel saving and optimisation mode for years.” Despite the downturn, UBS is still one of the more consistently profitable banks in Europe, reporting a return on equity of 10.8 per cent last year, outstripping its main rivals Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas.   “I don’t see a strategic decline, their business mix and geographic focus [on Asia and Europe] accounts for recent poor performance,” said Magdalena Stoklosa, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “There is no need for restructuring after two weak quarters, but some trimming around the edge is required, as global revenue pools shrink.”","23.05.2019"
"Saudi Arabia ‘bullies’ wealthy families to pump cash into oil IPO","Rich locals including Prince Alwaleed pushed to become cornerstone Aramco investors","Saudi Arabia is pressuring wealthy families to buy in to the initial public offering of its state oil company
, as part of a plan to achieve the $2tn valuation coveted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Eight people familiar with the talks said they were part of a plan to build confidence in the Saudi Aramco deal, which has been rocked by last weekend’s devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure. Four of the sources said the aim was to “strong-arm”, “coerce” or “bully” some of the wealthiest families in the kingdom to become cornerstone investors in what has been billed as the world’s biggest ever IPO. Many of the families targeted had members previously imprisoned in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2017 and 2018, in what the government billed as a crackdown on corruption. Some of the detainees said they were tortured, according to people aware of the matter. Most were later freed after they reached financial settlements with the state.
 Those pressured over Saudi Aramco include Alwaleed bin Talal, the once flamboyant billionaire who was held in the Ritz-Carlton for more than three months. Many of his assets remain frozen in Saudi Arabia, and people familiar with the talks said it has been suggested he should use them to buy into the IPO. He is now being encouraged to do his patriotic duty for the kingdom. But there is a limit on how patriotic he wants to beAdviser to Saudi business magnate A spokesman for Prince Alwaleed’s investment vehicle Kingdom Holding did not respond to a request for comment. Dozens of the wealthiest Saudi families have been approached, said a Saudi financier, who maintained the pressure was not overt. “It’s a big bunch from among the top 50,” he said. As part of the campaign, one Saudi Arabian business magnate has been tapped for as much as $100m, according to one of his advisers, who declined to make his identity public. The businessman, who was also detained in the Ritz, had earlier settled with the authorities, handing over assets and paying a monthly instalment to repay his alleged debt to the government. “He is now being encouraged to do his patriotic duty for the kingdom,” the adviser said. “But there is a limit on how patriotic he wants to be.” The pressure on local families shows the lengths the kingdom is going to in an effort to launch the IPO, three years after it was first announced. It also shines an uncomfortable spotlight on western bankers who have flocked to Riyadh to win roles advising Saudi Aramco or leading the placement. Saudi Aramco declined to comment.  “The allegations that Saudi Arabia has imposed pressure on families and individuals, inside or outside of the kingdom, to participate in the Aramco IPO at any set price level is baseless and incorrect,” a government official said. ‏”The structure of the much-anticipated IPO of Aramco . . . has not been announced yet by the relevant authorities, and hence any speculation at this point is baseless,” the official added. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are among more than a dozen western financial institutions set to promote the IPO to investors in the coming weeks. It is not clear if they are aware of the pressure placed on wealthy families in the kingdom, which one of the people familiar with the matter said originated with Saudi Arabia’s government rather than the company. The $2tn valuation placed on Aramco by Prince Mohammed slowed down the listing process last year due to fears it would embarrass the royal — who is the son of King Salman and the de facto ruler of the country — if it could not be achieved. Some banks that have been given roles on the IPO this month told Saudi officials they could hit a $2tn valuation, according to multiple people familiar with the process. Many analysts think a valuation of $1tn-$1.5tn is more realistic. The company is the world’s largest crude producer and most profitable company, but investors fear it carries significant political risk. Wealthy families, including many of the 300-plus royals and business magnates once held in the Ritz-Carlton, are therefore a key element of ensuring a successful, oversubscribed offering, bankers said. “Some will find it more difficult to say no than others,” said another person familiar with the talks, describing Riyadh’s approach as a combination of “cajoling and bullying”.  
One Saudi family approached by their relationship manager at a lender was told its assets frozen during the Ritz-Carlton affair could be transferred into Saudi Aramco stock. “And why not?” one banker said. “[They] can’t access those funds in any case.” Saudi Aramco plans to list up to 3 per cent of the company on the Tadawul exchange in Riyadh, including the portion allocated to cornerstone investors such as the wealthy families. That would raise $60bn for the kingdom. But the listing could still be limited to a 1 per cent stake.  Big investors in the region, including Abu Dhabi and Kuwait, and several big Asian institutions, were also expected to be approached, said two people briefed on the IPO process. One person suggested that wealthy families in Egypt and Lebanon with ties to the Saudi royals would also be approached. A plan to approach wealthy families as cornerstone investors was reported by Bloomberg last week. The report did not detail the pressure they are already being put under.

"Hedge fund Element Capital to raise performance fees to 40%","Jeffrey Talpins’ $18bn vehicle to shrink in size to avoid return-sapping bloat","Element Capital, one of the best-performing major hedge funds since the financial crisis, is sharply increasing its performance fee and shrinking the size of the fund to avoid falling prey to the return-sapping bloat that has affected many of its rivals. The $18bn hedge fund founded by Jeffrey Talpins, a former bond trader at Goldman Sachs and Citi who has emerged as one of the industry’s brightest stars, already charges a 2.5 per cent annual management fee and 25 per cent of gains, far higher than the industry average. But by the end of this year, the investment group will raise the levy on any profits it makes to 40 per cent, according to a letter to investors sent out on Monday evening — higher even than some of the best-known funds in the industry — although it will trim its management fee to 2 per cent.  Element also plans to reduce the size of its fund by 20 per cent by the end of 2019. If redemptions after the fee increase prove smaller than that target, it will return a pro rata slice of investors’ capital.* The changes represent an unusual move for an industry where investors are generally pushing money managers to lower fees of all kinds and few hedge funds ever willingly relinquish any dollars committed.  Broadly, hedge funds’ performance has also trailed behind badly in recent years, souring some big investors on hedge funds. Nonetheless, some players are still able to call their own shots, thanks to their size, performance and ravenous investor demand for the limited space in their top investment vehicles. “While a seemingly bleak snapshot, a small cohort of funds are prospering,” said Mark Connors, global head of risk advisory on Credit Suisse’s hedge fund servicing team. “Some have even been able to maintain pricing power, distancing themselves even further from the average manager.” Element Capital earlier this summer shuttered its “portfolio manager programme” of quasi-independent trading centres, but the hedge fund is up 6 per cent in the year through June, according to people familiar with the matter, slightly ahead of the average performance of other “macro” hedge funds, which try to profit from broad cross-market shifts.  Element has averaged annual returns of more than 20 per cent since 2005. In the letter, Mr Talpins indicated that the move was driven by a desire to optimise his hedge fund for performance rather than size. Many illustrious hedge fund managers have attracted vast piles of investor money over the years only to find it difficult to generate the returns they did earlier. The increased heft made it harder to be nimble in getting in and out of markets without making prices move against them. While hedge funds typically get a big slice of any profits they make, the big fees they also receive simply for managing the money means that traders with sizeable assets under management can become extremely wealthy even with mediocre returns.  The move by Element bucks the overall trend in the industry, where charges have continued to decline as investors push back after several years of poor performance and mounting cost consciousness.  As a result, the classic “2 and 20” hedge fund fee structure is now nearly dead. Hedge funds charge on average a management fee of 1.18 per cent and performance fees of 14.45 per cent, according to the data provider Eurekahedge.  There has been more pressure on management fees than on performance fees, with funds justifying the latter as an incentivising tool. Only 28 per cent of the assets in the industry are managed by funds charging at least 2 per cent, but more than half are subject to performance fees of 20 per cent or more. *This article has been amended to clarify the mechanism Element will use to cut the size of its fund

"Drop in hot stocks stirs memories of ‘quant quake’","Post-summer market rally masks momentum stocks’ worst day for a decade","The stock market may appear tranquil again after a rollercoaster summer, but many analysts and investors are unnerved by violent moves beneath the surface, reviving memories of the 2007 “quant quake” that shook the computer-driven investment industry. The FTSE All-World equity index has rallied almost 3 per cent already this month, clawing back some of August’s losses. However, many highly popular stocks suffered a sudden and brutal sell-off this week, a reversal that analysts have already dubbed the “momentum crash”. The blow was particularly strong in the US, where strong-momentum stocks — those with the best recent record — tumbled 4 per cent on Monday, in the worst one-day performance since 2009, according to Wolfe Research. Only once before, in 1999, has such a rout afflicted momentum-fuelled smaller company stocks, according to investment bank JPMorgan.  “This is massive,” said Yin Luo, head of quantitative strategy at Wolfe Research. “This is something that we haven’t seen for a long time. The question is why it’s happening, and what it means.” The flipside has been a dramatic renaissance for so-called “value” stocks — out-of-favour, often unglamorous companies in more economically sensitive industries. The S&P value index has climbed about 4 per cent this week and, compared with momentum stocks, enjoyed one of its biggest daily gains in a decade on Monday.   In essence, almost all of 2019’s hottest stocks have taken a hit, while the year’s most unloved dogs have enjoyed a roaring rally. Pravit Chintawongvanich, a strategist at US bank Wells Fargo, points out that the worst 12-month performers in the Russell 1000 equity index were up by the most on Monday, while the best 12-month performers were down the most.  This hurt many investors. The median long-short equity hedge fund — a strategy that strives to beat the market by picking winners — had lost 1.8 per cent in the month by the end of Wednesday, while computer-powered quantitative hedge funds have declined 2.3 per cent, and trend-following funds have shed 3.1 per cent, according to investment bank Credit Suisse.  Such a seismic rotation in investment “factors”, essentially the different groupings of stock market characteristics identified by financial academics, is rare, and reminiscent of a violent bout of turmoil that struck in the summer of 2007.  On August 6 2007, the quantitative investing industry, whose computer scientists used trading algorithms to systematically mine markets for money, suddenly and mysteriously saw their models go haywire, racking up huge losses for many “quant” powerhouses from Goldman Sachs Asset Management to Renaissance Technologies.   The turbulence lasted only a week and was later overshadowed by the financial crisis. But the event quickly became known as the quant quake, and remains etched in the memory of many hedge fund managers.  Now, as then, the cause for the sudden moves is a puzzle. Some have speculated that a big hedge fund or investment group may have been forced to pare back its positions, triggering a snowball that turned into an avalanche this week. But Mr Luo argues that the moves are big and broad enough to make it improbable.  More likely, analysts say, is that the momentum crash was triggered by the recent rise in bond yields. Momentum is often associated with trendy, high-growth companies, but over the past year more defensive “bond proxies” such as utilities and safer, resilient companies with strong balance sheets have actually enjoyed the strongest tailwinds, as investors have sought their safety and income amid concerns over the health of the global economy.  “By just looking at the price of the S&P 500 — not far from all-time highs — one cannot see the true state of equity markets,” Marko Kolanovic, head of quantitative strategy at JPMorgan, said in a note. “Most of the S&P 500 gains came from defensive sectors, stocks that investors tend to buy as a proxy for long duration bonds, and so-called ‘secular growth’ technology stocks. These stocks, incorrectly in our view, are deemed to be impermeable to economic woes.”  That illusion of invincibility appears to have led to investor “crowding” and extreme valuations for many stocks that are acutely sensitive to moves in bond yields, analysts say. On Monday, the 10-year US Treasury note dropped, sending yields 0.08 percentage points higher, and likely precipitating the violent reversal, argues Sarah McCarthy, a strategist at Bernstein.  The question is whether this is a passing market tempest — like the “tech tantrum” of 2017 — or the start of a longer-lasting shift away from the equity market’s biggest winners and into value stocks, which have largely underperformed since the financial crisis. Mr Kolanovic reckons that the rotation will probably continue, but that the broader market will remain buoyant. Indeed, JPMorgan’s strategists now recommend investors bet on companies that are being heavily shorted by hedge funds, on the basis that many will be forced to ratchet back their positions. However, the similarities to August 2007 unnerve Mr Luo, who points out that the quant quake was an under-appreciated early symptom of the far greater crisis that was starting to unfold at the time.  “This is a rare event, and might morph into something bigger,” said Mr Luo. “The 2007 quant crisis hinted at much bigger, more fundamental issues . . . [this sell-off] might also hint at much bigger problems.”","12.09.2019"
"Scor sues Barclays over botched takeover deal documents","French reinsurer wants bank to stop using the documents and hand them over","French reinsurer Scor has sued Barclays, demanding that the bank hand over hundreds of pages of confidential documents relating to a botched takeover bid it was working on.  Barclays had been advising Covéa, a French mutual insurer, which last year wanted to make a bid for Scor. Covéa is already Scor’s largest shareholder with 8 per cent and has a standstill agreement not to go beyond 10 per cent until April of this year. Scor pushed back strongly against the potential bid and Covéa has since said it was no longer interested in a deal. In court documents filed with the UK High Court relating to the case, Scor claims that “Barclays obtained from Covéa information that was highly confidential and sensitive to Scor”. Scor is demanding that Barclays stop using the documents and hand them over.  The information includes details of a valuation of Scor prepared by BNP Paribas and details of a rival deal that Scor was working on. This information, it alleges, came from Covéa’s chief executive Thierry Derez, who at the time had a seat on Scor’s board. He resigned from the board last November.  “Barclays knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that such information was confidential to Scor and/or that it had been obtained by Mr Derez in breach of confidence and loyalty owed to Scor,” the court documents say.  “So far as Scor is aware,” adds the filing, “Barclays remains in receipt of the confidential information and remains engaged by Covéa in relation to a potential acquisition by Covéa of Scor.” Scor is also claiming damages, although the court documents do not detail how much it wants, and it wants an inquiry into how much information Barclays received from Covéa or Mr Derez.  Barclays declined to comment.  Scor has previously launched legal action against Covéa, Mr Derez and Rothschild, one of the insurer’s other advisers. Rothschild has declined to comment and Covéa has denied any wrongdoing. Its board said last month that it “firmly rejects all the groundless accusations made by Scor and reaffirms its unanimous support to Thierry Derez and his action”. Mr Derez has dismissed Scor’s claims as “contrived”. Rothschild and Credit Suisse had also been advising Scor on the takeover attempt but the Swiss bank pulled out in the autumn.  In an interview with French daily Les Echos last month, Denis Kessler, Scor’s chief executive, said Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse, intervened personally to stop the bank advising Covéa.  The Scor boss also said that after winning a case in London’s High Court in December to force Credit Suisse to hand over documents relating to the deal, the bank “sent us more than 395 mails and 3,000 pages, which contained information and documents from Scor that should never have been sent to third parties”.","24.02.2019"
"Reliance sets its sights on the next prize: broadband","Latest foray shows Mukesh Ambani’s characteristic flair for marketing and an eye-catching deal","Three years ago this month, Asia’s richest man launched an Indian mobile operator that sparked a major overhaul of the world’s second-largest telecoms market. Several hundred million subscribers and a brutal price war later, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries is embarking on the next phase of its plan.  In addition to its existing business interests in everything from oil refining and petrochemicals to mobile phones and India’s largest retail chain, Reliance this month started selling broadband. This latest foray shows Mr Ambani’s characteristic flair for marketing and an eye-catching deal, promising ultrafast speeds, lower prices and even free TVs for annual subscribers. India’s fragmented broadband market, with some 18m households connected, seems ripe for the taking. Reliance Jio — the telecoms part of the conglomerate — plans to compete with existing providers such as Bharti Airtel and sign up new users, with an initial target of 20m homes and 15m business. This might appear small fry compared to the huge changes Jio brought to India’s mobile market. Since launching in 2016, it has attracted 340m customers, forced some incumbents like Vodafone to consolidate and others, like his brother Anil’s Reliance Communications, out of the sector altogether.   But executives and analysts say the move into broadband is a crucial part of Reliance’s plan to use its highly profitable oil-refining business — in which Saudi Aramco is taking a 20 per cent stake at a value of $75bn — as a springboard to becoming a tech giant that can take on the likes of Amazon, Google and Flipkart, the Indian ecommerce company owned by Walmart.  It’s going to be a very difficult task. But they have the patience, they have the capital to competeSatish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s going to be a very difficult task. But they have the patience, they have the capital to compete,” said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research. Reliance has carefully planned this moment. It started laying its fibre-optic cable network — India’s largest — in 2013 and spent nearly $50bn building digital infrastructure that included the cables, racking up net debt of $22bn in the process. Its broadband will eventually be on offer in 1,600 cities, Mr Ambani told shareholders in August, allowing customers to access services from media streaming to smart-home features like alarms and automatic lighting. The 20m homes target is the goal for the next 12 to 18 months, and Jio is eyeing a 50m target for three years time. For businesses, it is partnering with Microsoft to sell cloud-computing services. The broadband service will also play a crucial part in Reliance’s plans for an ecommerce site aimed at small retailers, say people familiar with the plans.  Jio will “suit the unique requirements of India and Indians spanning all walks of life,” Mr Ambani said at Reliance’s annual shareholder meeting last month, announcing the proposal. A person familiar with Reliance’s strategy said the goal is to provide Indians with a full array of digital services. “For Jio, it is the ability to get everything to the customer so you don’t leave [its] ecosystem,” the person said. “We give you everything in one place.”  Mukesh Ambani’s has said Reliance Jio's broadband will eventually be on offer in 1,600 cities © Bloomberg “There’s a lot of demand to be captured,” said Jayanth Kolla, founder of consultancy Convergence Catalyst. “Historically . . . Reliance does things big, at a big scale. 1,600 cities is their way of saying: we’ll be doing it almost on a pan-India basis.”  Reliance’s refinery and petrochemicals complex in western India, the country’s largest, has long been core to its business. Mr Ambani inherited this part of his father’s corporate empire after a high-profile split with his brother Anil, who ended up with the telecoms part of the conglomerate. But the price war following Jio’s rise led to Anil’s business entering bankruptcy proceedings. Cut-price contracts were key to Jio’s growth as a mobile operator: according to Credit Suisse, average revenue per gigabyte fell 95 per cent from 2016, when Jio entered the market, to about Rs15 ($0.21) in 2018. Data prices are now the lowest in the world as a percentage of gross domestic product.   Jio continues to add about 9m users a month and is on track to reach its goal of 500m, according to Bernstein.  But some analysts question whether it will be able to recreate that success in the broadband market, given the added costs and logistical challenges of connecting cables to customers’ homes. With home broadband packages ranging from Rs699 ($9.85) to Rs8,499 a month, prices are 13 to 23 per cent lower than what is already available, according to brokerage CLSA. But the firm doubts that will be enough to spark a surge in uptake: “While Jio will gain share, [it] is unlikely to expand the broadband market from [the] current 18m households as pricing has not been lowered meaningfully.”  “This is a very different and difficult business,” one industry participant said. “When it comes to shelling out money, you know how Indian consumers are: Extremely price conscious.”  People familiar with Reliance’s strategy said their research has identified more than enough households willing to pay the prices they are offering, and that consumers will welcome services such as streaming. But even if Reliance is only able to take a more modest slice of the potential broadband market, it is ultimately on course to have unrivalled digital access to increasingly affluent Indian consumers, said Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research.  “That’s the bigger story,” he said. “If I’m spending out of 24 hours, 12 hours in the Jio ecosystem — maybe it’s phone, TV, or watching content on the Jio platform — that means they have continuous access to me.”","16.09.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Smurfit Kappa, Asos, Boohoo, Rolls-Royce, Relx","Competition spells trouble for the online retailers, says Merrill","Wednesday 16:00 GMT What’s happening ● Smurfit Kappa led paper and packaging stocks higher after posting record full-year results. Operating earnings were up 25 per cent to €1.54bn, just beating a €1.53bn consensus, in spite of revenue falling slightly short of expectations.  “The results themselves should be well received by the market. The medium-term plan appears to be on track, and cash and dividend growth are good, [but] box volume growth was below expectations and could support fears that demand will be weak through 2019.”Citigroup ● Galliford Try
 led the FTSE 250 gainers after the construction services group posted a 4 per cent improvement in interim earnings, slightly better than expected. Weaker core construction profits and a flat performance for the group’s Linden housebuilding division were offset by partnership disposals, lower central costs and reduced interest charges.  
 Sellside stories ● Merrill Lynch downgraded Asos to “underperform” and cut Boohoo to “neutral” with price targets of £24 and 200p respectively. The rise of online shopping and broader consumer choice had failed to boost industry revenue, with fast fashion growing at its slowest pace since the credit crunch, Merrill said.  Boohoo was facing competition from a second wave of disrupters, said Merrill, which identified 11 small brands in the UK that were taking on the clothes retailer directly. International competition had also strengthened, threatening Boohoo’s growth outside the core UK market, the broker added.  As well as a more fragmented, competitive and promotional environment, Boohoo likely faced rising shipment costs because its expansion was abroad while its logistics footprint was entirely in the UK, said Merrill. Its team also voiced concerns that Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo’s fastest growing label, is only 66 per cent controlled by the group. On Asos, Merrill said the stock was “priced for perfection, but we now see margin recovery as increasingly unlikely”. It cited “unavoidable” promotional activity and a clustering of revenues around sales periods such as Black Friday.  “The retail market is becoming fragmented as barriers to scale fade,” said Merrill, whose analysis identified 10 brands competing directly with Asos’s own label in the UK. And with European retailer inventories piling up post Christmas, the high street stores would also compete aggressively for growth, it said. Merrill forecast Asos margins to weaken 2.5 percentage points over the next three years. It expected the company to reset targets for its US division due to more onerous import tariffs, a higher reliance on third-party labels than in Europe and potential price cuts to compensate consumers for sales taxes. At an 80 per cent premium to peers, Asos’s valuation “looks inflated”, it said. ● Credit Suisse upgraded Rolls-Royce to “outperform” from “neutral” with a £10.65 target price. The Trent 1000, Rolls’s jet engine powering Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, “has been the key execution impediment to the case and it now appears to be showing signs of improvement”, it said. A fix to the engine certified at the end of December appears to be working, with aircraft storage data suggesting that the number of parked jets has been reducing steadily for four months now, said Credit Suisse.  “With the Trent 1000 issue back on the right path, a key downside risk to free cash flow expectations would be lifted” and investors could concentrate on reorganisation progress and the strong performance of its Airbus-exclusive Trent XWB turbine, Credit Suisse said.   ● In brief: Banco BPM raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Derwent London rated new “sell” at Berenberg; Great Portland Estates rated new “sell” at Berenberg; Haulotte raised to “buy” at Société Générale; Helical rated new “hold” at Berenberg; Metro AG cut to “underweight” at JPMorgan; Orion downgraded to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Relx cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; The Works rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Victrex raised to “buy” at N+1 Singer.

"FT investigation: Wirecard suspect accounting practices revealed","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Tuesday was a turbulent day for shares and bonds in Wirecard, the German financial payments company which has a larger market capitalisation than Deutsche Bank, the country’s biggest-listed lender.  Why? The reason appears to be the release of the latest investigation by our colleague Dan McCrum into the company. Wirecard dismissed the latest FT reporting, saying it was based on “fabricated” documents.  But investors have fled, sending the company’s shares down more than 14 per cent to €120 and putting its market value below €15bn.  That means Wirecard’s shares are now trading below the strike price for SoftBank’s original convertible bond. In a stroke of good fortune, the Japanese tech giant cut its exposure to Wirecard last month, as DD’s Robert Smith and Arash Massoudi wrote about here.  Wirecard’s bonds have also taken a hammering. The €500m five-year bond Wirecard issued in early September plunged to 83 cents on the euro on Tuesday. And a €900m bond exchangeable into the company’s stock sold by Credit Suisse less than a month ago, has fared even worse. Investors bought the bond above its face value — at 107 cents on the euro — and it’s now trading at just 81 cents on the euro. A quick explainer on Wirecard: founded in 1999, it was initially known for processing payments for online gambling markets and porn sites before it purchased a bank in 2006 and evolved into a full-service payments operation. It’s widely seen as a fintech success story. A team at the FT has been looking into the company for a long time.  So what’s in the latest story from Dan? Let’s start with Al Alam, referred to as a “third-party acquirer” by Wirecard employees. A very large proportion of the company’s sales and profits in 2016 appear to have been attributed to Al Alam. Yet Al Alam’s operations are threadbare. Neither Visa or Mastercard, the big payment networks that license companies to help retailers accept credit card transactions, have any record of a relationship with the group.  The other problem is that most of Al Alam’s clients identified in the Wirecard reports don’t seem to know who Al Alam is and some don’t even exist. Of the 34 clients listed as passing through Al Alam in internal financial reports from 2016 and 2017, almost half had never heard of the company and eight had shut down entirely. But somehow €350m of payments had passed through Al Alam for these clients every month.   Where are the auditors in all of this? EY, one of the Big Four worldwide accountancy and auditing firms, has lent credibility to Wirecard’s reporting but their oversight has come under question.  These reasons and others reported on in the piece and in the course of the FT’s investigation into Wirecard explain why Dan’s piece ends with one of the most strongly worded endings you’ll see in any piece of our journalism:  “The FT has consistently raised questions about Wirecard’s accounting and practices since 2015, while the company has repeatedly cast such criticism of its business as the work of market manipulators. Germany’s financial regulator appears to have been sympathetic, imposing an unprecedented ban on short selling bets against Wirecard for two months this year.”  “Investors and regulators are left to consider a question of credibility. Are the internal documents published today by the FT really fake, or should that description be applied to much of the profits at one of Germany’s largest and most popular companies?” Dan has written a detailed explainer for Alphaville we strongly recommend you check out. You can download all the files and follow along as he walks you through the Wirecard documents.  The folks at Alphaville have also initiated coverage so to speak on Société Générale analyst Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, who writes notes on Wirecard. Read why Alphaville has rated Beaudoux ‘SELL’ here.  We’d also like to hear your thoughts so please get in touch at due.diligence@ft.com or message Dan directly. Investment banking read across It’s that time of the year again: pumpkin spice lattes, cosy jumpers and . . . Q3 bank earnings.  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo kicked off earnings season on Tuesday.  The good:  JPM retained its crown as Wall Street’s darling in the third quarter despite its entanglements with troubled office-space provider WeWork and Adam Neumann, the company’s founder.  The bank’s investment banking division, which handled WeWork’s aborted initial public offering, had its best-ever third quarter with revenues up 8 per cent to $1.9bn between July and September. Other parts of the bank also performed well.  The not so good:  Goldman Sachs missed its third-quarter earnings expectations. The 150-year-old institution posted a worse than expected 27 per cent fall in net income in the three months to September.  In sharp contrast to rival JPM, Goldman’s investment banking fees were down 15 per cent year-on-year to $1.69bn. The division had to swallow losses from tech investments in the form of WeWork and Uber.  Citigroup and Wells Fargo also posted lacklustre results, making JPM the standout performer in the big four banks.  One quick takeaway from earnings: don’t bet against the American consumer. DE Shaw turbojets activist strategy DE Shaw is widely known for its quantitative trading prowess.  But lately the $50bn hedge fund has been dipping its toes in the activist pool. First there was an activist stake in home improvement retailer Lowes, then the natural gas company EQT.  Now DE Shaw is pushing for Emerson Electric, the automation and building equipment group, to break up into two businesses — industrial automation and climate technology. The group launched a scathing attack on the company’s management and board. You can see the full presentation here.   It seems things have been getting a little heated behind the scenes: “Rather than continue to engage with us in constructive, private dialogue, the board appears instead to be laying the public groundwork for a full-throated defence of its indefensible track record,” DE Shaw managing directors Edwin Jager and Michael O’Mary said in a letter to the company’s board. DE Shaw is leading the campaign without Quentin Koffey, the hedge fund manager it snapped up from Elliott Management two years ago, who departed for Senator Investment Group in May.  Activism has become popular among managers who are looking for strategies that low-cost index funds can’t replicate.  What’s interesting of late is that activists are taking smaller stakes and asking for big changes. DE Shaw has a 1 per cent stake in Emerson, yet wants to split the company. Similarly, Elliott is calling for changes at AT&T with a $3.2bn stake in the more than $270bn company.  Job moves WeWork is losing its chief communications officer Jimmy Asci after just six months and a barrage of bad news, Bloomberg reported. 

Gilead Sciences has appointed Andrew Dickinson, a former Lazard Frères & Co banker, as its chief financial officer.

"Opening Quote: US private equity house to buy Sophos in $3.9bn deal","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.  Monday morning’s big deal checks a lot of current trend boxes. In the latest take-private example of a British company by an overseas buyer, US private equity house Thoma Bravo is picking up cyber security group Sophos at a valuation of $3.9bn (£3.1bn) once the company’s debt is taken into account. The deal makes clear strategic sense for Thoma Bravo, a software specialist investor, even if this is its first large transaction outside the US. Previous deals have included cyber security group Imperva ($2.1bn), data visualisation company Qlik ($3bn) and mortgage software group Ellie Mae ($3.7bn). Last year it approached — and was rebuffed by — US cyber security group Symantec, which has had a host of suitors. The strategic rationale for Sophos is less evident, apart from the cash and the premium. Sophos says Thoma Bravo’s “expertise” in the sector will help to accelerate growth and improve profitability and performance, though it is not clear exactly how. There will be continued investment “while evaluating opportunities to streamline operational functions”. Sophos has only been public for four years. Through to 2018 the shares enjoyed quite the run, aided by the rush to cyber security in the wake of the WannaCry attack. Since then growth has cooled a bit, as has the share price. This deal is all cash and will hand investors a 37 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price, or 46 per cent when benchmarked against the average price over the past 6 months. Briefly  It’s quids-in for PwC’s former partners; less so for current ones at law firm Pinsent Masons. More than 1,000 partners at the Big Four accounting firm’s UK arm shared a windfall of £100m last year through its annuities system after a record year for profits at the business. At Pinsent Masons however partners have been told their next quarterly dividend will be half the amount expected after the firm failed to chase down enough outstanding bills. Pinsent’s Richard Foley, a senior partner at the firm, said it was “no secret” businesses were experiencing more difficult trading conditions — though PwC’s ex partners could be forgiven for not noticing. Two big items of non-corporate City news on Monday morning. Extinction Rebellion activists are disrupting the City in the latest round of the group’s protests.

And the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has announced government plans for a pre-election budget on November 6, assuming a Brexit deal has been reached and the UK has left the EU. After engineering his return to retailer Superdry in April, founder Julian Dunkerton has had his contract as chief executive extended until 2021. He was previously serving as interim chief executive. Superdry said the extension “reflects the board’s unanimous view” that Mr Dunkerton was the right man to lead the turnround — which isn’t that surprising given the old board walked out en masse after being defeated in the tussle for control of the company. Today in digital banking, “original challenger bank” First Direct is set for a refresh by owner HSBC as it seeks to lure younger customers and compete with the likes of Monzo, while new generation challenger Revolut is back on the fundraising trail as it looks to continue its worldwide domination.

"Federal Reserve stress test regime to be simplified","Quarles says financial sector’s post-crisis recapitalisation is ‘complete’","The head of banking supervision at the Federal Reserve declared that the post-crisis era of banks building up their capital reserves was now “complete”, opening the door to a simplification of the stress testing regime. Speaking at a Fed conference in Boston on Tuesday, Randal Quarles said the largest US banks had built enough capital to withstand a severe recession, and partly as a result he was proposing a series of moves to ease their regulatory burden. The Fed vice-chair has already unveiled several changes to banking supervision that have relaxed obligations, especially for smaller banks, but which some have criticised as rolling back the Dodd-Frank rules put in place after the financial crisis. He said on Tuesday that he would like to go further in “tailoring” banking regulations to each institution, including changing the way the Fed measures large banks’ capital ratios. Mr Quarles said: “The stress tests demonstrate that banks have now built enough capital to withstand the severe recession. The capital building phase of the post-crisis era is now complete.” He said he was optimistic that he could change the way the Fed measured capital by 2020, so that large banks would have to maintain a single capital ratio, rather than complying with two different regimes. Under the current system, banks have to hold 7 per cent of their risk-weighted assets in common equity tier one capital, and also show they would still hold enough to be able to lend during a severe recession under the stress test scenario. The Fed proposed this year to change this to a single capital requirement based on the amount of money the bank would lose in a worst-case scenario.  Officials say this would cut large banks’ regulatory burden, but not the amount of capital they have to hold. Mr Quarles said the requirement would not be less than 7 per cent for any bank, even after the change. On Tuesday, Mr Quarles put a timeframe on his relaxation plan for the first time. The odds were good that it would be enacted in time for next year’s stress tests, he said. He also said that the Fed was also pushing ahead with plans not to publicly shame banks that are judged to have substandard procedures for calculating their capital needs to weather a downturn. This so-called “qualitative” part of the stress tests has caught out several banks in the past, including Credit Suisse this year.  Fed officials say that in future, while banks will still be tested on the quality of their capital planning, those results will not be made public. Earlier on Tuesday at the conference, Fed chair Jay Powell said that the stress tests would continue to “evolve”, as they have in recent years by shifting the assumptions about a worst-case economic downturn. Mr Quarles also repeated his suggestion that banks might be allowed to set their capital based on an average of several stress tests rather than just one.  “One option to address the year-over-year volatility of the test would be to average the results of the tests from the previous year or X number of years,” he said. “Mathematically, it would mean that no single year could have an outsized influence on the amount of capital that a bank is required to maintain.”","09.07.2019"
"Top banks push ahead with digital coins for 2020","Move draws on four years of research into uses of crypto technology","Thirteen of the world’s biggest banks are preparing to launch digital versions of major global currencies in 2020 after years of research convinced them that the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could be used to make trading less risky and cheaper.  The UBS-led research on a “utility settlement coin” (USC) has been in the ether since 2015, when banks decided to investigate whether wholesale banking could be made more efficient by deploying distributed ledger technology (DLT).   DLT, which is used in blockchain networks, enables participants to instantly share information on an open-access ledger which can never be altered or erased.  The technology could theoretically replace reams of paperwork and processing, but banks must first confront legal and regulatory hurdles on everything from risk management to privacy before deploying it widely.  “When we started out . . . this project has basically been about R&D, we didn’t know if the characteristics [we wanted to achieve] were possible,” said Rhom Ram, head of Fnality, the new venture into which the banks and exchange Nasdaq have just invested £50m to create a market infrastructure to transfer value digitally.  “The funding signals that it is possible,” he added. “The investors believe it is possible based on the evidence they have seen.”  Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investments at UBS’s investment bank, said the research showed the USC would soon be used for clearing and settling trades and could ultimately prove “transformational” for trading.  “We see a way of actually reducing the risk significantly in the post trade world,” he said, referring to the settlement, credit and counterparty risks banks take on between the time that trades are instructed and when the money and assets actually change hands. “All of these things play into costs, operational efficiency and the balance sheet.”  Lee Braine, an executive at Barclays’ chief technology office, said his bank’s confidence in the project’s viability had “meaningfully” increased since it joined the effort a year-and-a-half ago. Other big banks involved in the project include Santander, BNY Mellon, MUFG, Credit Suisse, KBC, ING and Canada’s CIBC.  The USC will begin life with 14 owners and members, and will be denominated in major global currencies including the US dollar, yen, euro and sterling. Every unit of a dollar-denominated USC will be backed by a traditional dollar at the Federal Reserve, and the same model will be used with other currencies, ensuring the value of the coin is stable.  Its initial applications will be in relatively niche areas, such as creating a market infrastructure that allows the coins to be used to meet margin requirements in derivatives trades. Mr Ram said while at present it took at least a day for such requirements to be satisfied, using the USC the process could become almost instantaneous. Mr Braine said that while the size of the founding banks meant their efforts would have “traction” from launch, the impact would not be a “big bang”. “This ultimately is a market transformation over time,” he said.  Japanese banks are also working on a digital coin — the J Coin — but they are focusing on retail banking, as is social media giant Facebook, which is developing a coin pegged to the dollar which could be used to instantly transfer value between Facebook users.

"Fed cuts red tape but toughens liquidity rules for foreign banks","US regulatory overhaul cuts burden for some, but not all","Some large foreign banks operating in the US face having to hold more liquid assets under a regulatory shake-up proposed on Monday by the Federal Reserve. The changes to the post-crisis rule book would reduce capital requirements and frequency of stress tests for many institutions, but they also tighten liquidity rules for a list of banks that could include Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.  The plans are based on those released by the Fed last year for domestic banks, designed to regulate institutions in different ways depending on how much risk they pose to the financial system.  Whereas for domestic banks the changes largely came as a relief from the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation, the outcome is more complex for foreign banks, some of which are set to gain while others are likely to lose out. Under the new rules, banks would have to hold different amounts of liquid assets depending on how big their US subsidiaries are and the riskiness of their activities. Foreign banks operating in the US tend to rely on less stable short-term wholesale funding, the Fed said, which heightens their risk. Liquid assets are those which are easy to sell to cover short-term cash needs. The Fed will sort foreign banks into four tiers based on their perceived riskiness. For Barclays and Deutsche Bank, it could mean they have to hold significantly more liquid assets than under the current regime, depending on how regulators treat their cross-border transactions. The central bank said it did not yet have the data to decide which tier those banks would be in.  For the two big Swiss investment banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, the changes would mean the amount of liquid assets they must hold will be set by the regulator for the first time, rather than by their own internal stress tests. Fintech Faceoff: a new dawn for retail banking? Overall, the Fed calculated, liquid assets held by foreign banks will have to increase by up to 4 per cent, or between $1bn and $10bn across the industry. The new system is likely to provide relief for Santander, the Spanish bank, which will no longer be subject to a rule that it must have enough liquid assets on hand to cover three weeks’ worth of operations; it will only have to meet its own internal stress tests. The Fed punted on an issue that has particularly concerned foreign banks, namely a proposal to extend liquidity rules to cover US branches of foreign banks, not just their US subsidiaries, which could significantly increase liquidity requirements. The Fed will put such a proposal out for further consideration. One Fed governor, Lael Brainard, voted against the package of reforms in protest at the failure to include the local branches. “I am disappointed the proposal today does not address this important outstanding vulnerability and therefore does not represent a balanced package,” she said. In other proposed changes announced on Monday, several foreign banks will now only have to participate in regulatory stress tests every two years rather than annually. They include Santander, BNP Paribas and Société Générale. And several large banks — both foreign and domestic — will only have to file a so-called “living will” every three years, rather than every two. In these resolution plans, a bank spells out how it can be unwound in an orderly way if it were to fail. Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice-chair for bank supervision, said: “The proposals seek to increase the efficiency of the firms without compromising the strong resiliency of the financial sector.”","08.04.2019"

Drinks and snacks will be served. Register your interest to attend. 
 Now to today’s main topic . . .
 When hedge funds and former managers fall out, the ego clash can get confrontational. In the case of Dan Michalow, the former co-head of DE Shaw’s $6bn macro strategy, who told a colleague at the hedge fund that he wanted an assistant who he could call “sugar tits”, it has become messy.  The former partner, who left in March last year at the age of 35 over the fallout from the comment, has accused the firm of issuing a public statement that he says escalated his actions into the #MeToo realm of corporate scandals. He is suing for defamation in a private arbitration, seeking hundreds of millions of dollars. DE Shaw has gone further since, he claims, forcing him out of his golf club membership (it’s since been reinstated) and blocking his relationships with several high-level individuals affiliated with the hedge fund. The firm, where Jeff Bezos cut his teeth before leaving to found an internet bookseller, is fighting back. DE Shaw says “Michalow’s account of his separation from the firm and subsequent events is inaccurate and incomplete”, and calls his claims “meritless”. It denies having anything to do with the golf club membership suspension. Michalow says the dispute is all down to DE Shaw’s determination to keep him from competing with the firm, either by starting his own fund or joining another. He says he declined to sign an unpaid non-compete agreement subsequent to his departure and that the fund issued the statement as a way of making him too toxic to hire or allocate money to. But Michalow has made his share of public comments. After DE Shaw issued the statement, Michalow published a private letter he had written to its founder, David Shaw, on social media. In it, he conceded that he may have deserved to be fired for being “an abrasive boss” and described the firm as one that threw “lavish, alcohol-fuelled parties”. Read the full take here. Hong Kong listings: this Bud’s for you Anheuser-Busch InBev took no chances with its second run at a Hong Kong stock market listing for its Asia brewing business. In fact, it looks like the company learnt from some of its mistakes by bringing in Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC as a cornerstone investor after turning its nose up at the idea earlier this summer.  Pricing on the first try proved too frothy for investors; the second round is looking a touch flat. The world’s largest brewer priced shares in its Asia-Pacific business at the lower end of a planned range on Tuesday, raising $5bn from the sale of shares in the division — about half of what it had hoped to raise when it tried to list the unit in July. The listing will be a big boost to Hong Kong’s global IPO status this year but it’s going to take way more than that to catch up to its rivals in New York. Before AB InBev’s pricing, total funds raised from Hong Kong IPOs in 2019 came to $10.7bn, just a third of the total from a year ago. NYSE and Nasdaq, meanwhile, have seen no such slump.  With Hong Kong’s stock market hit by a double whammy from the US-China trade war and local political tumult, a record 200-plus companies that have already applied to list have yet to push forward. Many of them are waiting for the volatility to ease up before pulling the trigger.  “It becomes very difficult to price your IPO against a volatile window, I think that’s why people are waiting,” said Jason Elder, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown in Hong Kong.  There is no clear end in sight for either conflict, so Hong Kong could be waiting for a while.  Go deeper on Hong Kong’s IPO slump here. Story in a graphic: exchanges industry consolidation The biggest M&A ticket in London involves the London Stock Exchange Group, which has agreed a $27bn deal to buy Refinitiv, the data and trading provider, and has batted away a rival £32bn approach from Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing.  HKEX isn’t taking “no” for an answer, trying to persuade LSE shareholders of the merits of its bid.  This week UBS, Credit Suisse and HSBC joined HKEX’s roster, making 10 the number of banks and specialist boutiques advising the three parties. By chance both Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, and his counterpart at the LSE, David Schwimmer, were on consecutive panels at the Sibos payments conference, also in London on Tuesday.  Handlers kept them away from each other but both backed their preferred deals. For Li, his deal is about connecting east and west. “Together we complete each other,” he cooed. Schwimmer said: “We view Shanghai as the financial centre for China.” Still some way to go for Li yet. With the latest round of dealmaking in mind, the FT’s Philip Stafford and Patrick Mathurin have put together this graphic-led story on the history of exchange consolidation.

"Anglo American closes in on Peruvian copper bounty","Quellaveco project highlights challenge of sustainable mining in low carbon era","Some 3,500 metres above sea level in the desolate mountains of southern Peru lies one of the world’s biggest untapped deposits of copper.  Quellaveco — or Ash Mountain — contains enough copper to wire 90m electric vehicles, according to its owner Anglo American, which is spending at least $5bn to unlock this vast natural bounty. A great deal is riding on the project not just for Anglo, which has been transformed under the leadership of Mark Cutifani over the past six years, but also for Peru, where mining is the mainstay of the economy accounting for 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Anglo is still scarred by a disastrous Brazilian iron ore project called Minas Rio and has not tried to build an entirely new mine in more than a decade. As for Peru, its president Martin Vizcarra was born in the local town of Moquegua and helped broker the 2012 agreement with local residents that underpins the project. “This is a very important project for Anglo,” said Sam Catalano, analyst at Credit Suisse. “There is still a good portion of investors who are wary of Anglo’s large project delivery credentials post Minas Rio. If they can deliver Quevalleco on time and on budget it will put a lot of those fears to bed.” But Quellaveco is important for other reasons, not least because it highlights some of the challenges facing the industry to sustainably produce the raw materials — particularly copper — needed for the shift to a low-carbon economy.  “Quellaveco may be one of the last, if not the last [open cast] mine of this size and scale,” said Tom McCulley, head of Anglo American in Peru.
 For most of the last century, the industry has responded to the challenges presented by ageing mines and declining ore grades by digging deeper and crushing more rocks. As a result it now takes double the amount of water and 15 times the amount of power to produce 40kg of copper than in 1900, according to the company. But this approach is increasingly at odds with a more environmentally conscious society. There have already been protests at Quellaveco by residents who claim Anglo has not honoured commitments made in 2012, especially on local employment and the environment, “It’s contradictory that the company is claiming to be a climate leader, expanding its copper operation for the good of the planet, but it’s also happy to do so at the expense of communities, climate-critical ecosystems and vital water sources,” said Lucio Cuenca, director of the Latin American Observatory for Environmental Conflicts. Like most of the world’s big miners, Anglo believes copper has the best long-term prospects of any leading commodity.  As the world moves to cleaner sources of energy, copper — which is a very efficient at conducting electricity — will be increasingly in demand as more solar panels and wind farms are connected to the grid and the use of electric cars grows.   However, big easy-to-mine copper deposits are becoming harder to find and most of the world’s big producers — a group that includes BHP, Codelco, Glencore and Freeport-McMoRan — are focused on expanding existing mines rather than new projects. Quellaveco is one of just a handful of large copper deposits being developed in the world. Anglo acquired Quellaveco in 1992 but the project was not given the green light until July 2018, by which time its owner had “derisked” it by a selling a 40 per cent stake to Mitsubishi. Anglo has been wary of developing new mines since Minas Rio, which it bought in 2008. The project ran years late and billions of dollars over budget. Company executives say the longer gestation period for Quellaveco has given them a far better understanding of the deposit than at Minas Rio and time to secure all of the main permits before starting construction. Anglo’s operations in Colombia, Chile and Brazil already face community opposition for a long trail of devastating impacts on ecosystems, territories and waterSebastian Ordoñez Muñoz, War on Want.  At Quellaveco, the company is planning to use a fleet of 30 autonomous trucks to haul rocks to a giant crushing machine. The pulverised ore will be placed on a 3.5km conveyor belt and sent through a hillside to a processing plant. Here it will be turned into feedstock for copper smelters and trucked to a port 165km away. However, the biggest engineering challenge has been changing the course of the Asana river — a main water source for Moquegua and the surrounding area. That has meant building a dam across the river valley and boring a tunnel through another mountain to send the river around the mine and back to its natural course — at a cost of $20m. Building a new mine high in a river valley does have some advantages, said project director Christoff Kühn during a visit to the site. The Asana river has stripped away much of the waste rock and soil lying over the deposit, he said, leaving a layer of copper not far below the surface. For the first five years, mining will focus on this area — with the aim of Anglo and Mitsubishi recouping their investment in just four years. Overall, Anglo executives estimate Quellaveco contains enough copper to support 100 years of production — its official reserve life is 30 years — and say the mine has been constructed so that new technology can be easily introduced.  One of the innovations Anglo is working on is called “coarse particle flotation”, a processing technique that will boost water recycling. Water management is a key issue in Peru where there is a high risk of drought. Mines are heavily dependent on water to extract minerals from crushed ore and Quellaveco is no exception — it needs 22m cubic metres of water a year to function. Anglo insists none of the water will come from the Asana river after construction is completed. Instead, it will take 18m cubic metres of water from a contaminated river higher up in the mountains and the rest from another river where the company is building a reservoir that will also be used to supply the local community. However, its plans have alarmed some activists who say the company has been responsible for the contamination of water and the displacement of communities across South America.  “Anglo-American’s operations in Colombia, Chile and Brazil already face major community opposition for a long trail of devastating impacts on ecosystems, territories and water,” said Sebastian Ordoñez Muñoz, senior programmes officer at War on Want.   Of course, the company sees things differently and said it has responded to the concerns of communities in Peru by spending $400m on water related infrastructure. It has also spent $30m of a $300m community fund to improve relations with locals.  “Most of the protests are protests of opportunity not of: we don’t want you around,” said Mr McCulley. “These communities are poor . . . They may bring up an environmental issue, a job issue, but it is more: can you do something to help us?” At peak construction, 14,000 people will be employed at Quellaveco, with 5,600 from the local community. Once the mine is in production that number will fall to 2,500. If everything goes to plan, it will produce its first copper in 2022 and reach full capacity 18 months later. By that point it will be churning out 330,000 tonnes of copper a year. If that target is met it will cap a remarkable turnround for Anglo, which was at a low ebb when Mr Cutifani joined. Under his leadership, the company has slashed its debts, slimmed down and dramatically improved its operating performance. His next goals are to deliver Quellaveco and roll out new technology. “I’d like to be able to say we have delivered it . . . I think that is the right time to talk about succession,” he told the Financial Times in a recent interview.","27.10.2019"
"Deutsche is having a Lehman moment in a roaring bull market","Miserable end to investment bank venture could have been avoided","© Bloomberg From a distance, Deutsche Bank’s capitulation is bizarre. Lehman Brothers failed during a full-blown financial crisis, with 26,000 employees losing their jobs. This weekend, Deutsche Bank’s sweeping restructuring of its investment bank will bring a similar level of mass redundancies — but after a decade-long bull market. The market, political and regulatory pressure has built for years. Deutsche’s management is finally giving up. The Frankfurt bosses will rip out the heart of the US investment bank, quarantining unwanted assets in a “bad bank” and attempting to sell off whole businesses. What is sad for 20,000 bankers and traders, compliance and support staff is good news for investors who have seen their shares fall 80 per cent in 10 years. It should be a relief, too, for the German taxpayer, who has remained the ultimate backstop for this hulking “too big to fail” institution.  Deutsche emerged from the 2008 crisis proud of having avoided a government bailout. But as whistleblowers claimed — and the Securities and Exchange Commission later confirmed — its stated balance sheet was distorted by false accounting.  After the crisis, legacy trades continued to clog the books and, in a world of higher capital requirements, Deutsche could no longer take the giant leveraged bets that used to flatter its income statement. Was there another path? Different leaders might have helped. Some cite as a potential lost saviour Edson Mitchell, former head of securities sales and trading, who  died in a plane crash in 2000. But a quote attributed to him also shows an enduring Deutsche problem: ‘If you don’t have $100m by the time you’re 40, you’re a failure.’” The big bonuses were made in the pre-crisis years but even in today’s relative austerity, Deutsche had 643 employees earning more than €1m last year. Whatever its meagre return on equity, Deutsche usually made money for someone — just for the top staff rather than shareholders. Some former employees suggest an earlier reckoning might have worked wonders. If Deutsche had acknowledged its dire straits and accepted massive government support, it might have wound up like Citigroup, which took $45bn of US government money in the crisis but ended up with a viable business.  Had it followed Goldman Sachs and Bank of America in accepting a restorative capital injection from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, things might have been different. Instead, Deutsche used Berkshire for a series of secret derivatives trades that deferred real reform. “The one word that would describe what took place with the US investment banks versus the European banks would be ‘capital’,” says Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo, who once worked for Deutsche. “The larger US banks raised more capital faster and have more actively reallocated that capital than others.” Today, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase outperform Deutsche, Credit Suisse, UBS and Barclays. They are benefiting from their greater heft in trading. As Mr Mayo says, “Goliath is winning.” When Deutsche retreats, “Wall Street” will be a broken synecdoche. Deutsche, at number 60, was the last investment bank in that part of Lower Manhattan. What will remain are recriminations over how Europe’s investment banking champion failed to last the distance. tom.braithwaite@ft.com

"London’s King’s Cross uses facial recognition in security cameras","Multiple cameras set up to observe visitors in area and Canary Wharf may follow suit","London’s King’s Cross is using facial recognition to track tens of thousands of people and Canary Wharf is considering following suit, across a total area that covers more than 160 acres of the city. The 67-acre King’s Cross area, which has been recently redeveloped and houses several office buildings including Google’s UK headquarters, Central Saint Martins college, schools and a range of retailers, has multiple cameras set up to observe visitors.  Argent, the property developer for the King’s Cross estate, said: “These cameras use a number of detection and tracking methods, including facial recognition, but also have sophisticated systems in place to protect the privacy of the general public.” The person did not confirm how many cameras were in use or how long facial recognition had been active in the area. Meanwhile, Canary Wharf is in talks to install facial recognition across its 97-acre estate, which counts many major financial services companies, including Barclays, Credit Suisse and HSBC, as tenants. Canary Wharf Group, the company that owns both private offices and public spaces in the area, is actively speaking to facial recognition suppliers to pilot the technology in an area traversed by 140,000 people daily, as part of its security systems. “What’s really worrying is for any worker who doesn’t want to participate. This is essentially a geofenced experiment, so I don’t see how anybody could opt out of it,” said Stephanie Hare, an independent researcher of facial recognition technologies in the UK. “You can’t opt out of walking around London, or working there. How do they defend it when this technology is the subject of legal action and MPs are calling for a moratorium on it?”  Under current general data protection laws, collecting sensitive personal data including faces requires explicit consent from the people being observed. If the technology were to be adopted in Canary Wharf, it would not operate continuously on pedestrians and office workers, but be limited to specific purposes or threats, according to sources close to the company.  Canary Wharf currently operates at least 1,750 CCTV cameras, as well as an automatic licence plate recognition system to track vehicles in the area, according to Genetec, a Canadian company that supplies the district with its security software. The systems then automatically notify police of any hits from a vehicle watchlist. As facial recognition technology has become consumerised in recent years, via companies such as Apple and Facebook, it has been adopted enthusiastically in the UK, where at least two police forces including London’s Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police have trialled facial recognition systems on innocent citizens. Convenience stores such as Budgens and supermarkets — including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks and Spencer — all have cameras that are already, or soon will be, capable of facial recognition, used for applications ranging from crime prevention to estimating the age of those buying alcohol or cigarettes.  London already has an estimated 420,000 CCTV cameras operating in and around the city, although many were installed as analogue video systems that are low-quality and difficult to scale. Increasingly, these are being upgraded to “internet protocol” cameras that are connected to the internet, which have far better image resolution and can be accessed remotely. These cameras can also be upgraded to include facial recognition software.  “The private sector uses of facial recognition need a lot of attention because there is less regulation and governance here,” said Pete Fussey, a criminologist at the University of Essex who specialises in digital surveillance. “The privatisation of public spaces in London raises interesting legal questions [for surveillance].” The Information Commissioner’s Office, which is the UK regulator for data protection, said it was looking into the use of facial recognition technology by police and private companies. “Since new data protection laws came into effect on 25 May 2018, there are extra protections for people. These require organisations to assess and reduce the privacy risks of using new and intrusive surveillance technologies like automatic facial recognition,” said a spokesperson. “Organisations wishing to automatically capture and use images of individuals going about their business in public spaces need to provide clear evidence to demonstrate it is strictly necessary and proportionate for the circumstances and that there is a legal basis for that use.” Why police use of facial recognition technology raises privacy fears Letter in response to this article: Function creep should be ringing alarm bells / From Prof Emeritus John Taylor, St Andrews, Fife, UK

"Endless money pit that is WeWork gets more SoftBank funding","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Adam Neumann will be among the highest-paid chief executives anywhere on the planet this year. Let that sink in for a second.  The former chief executive and co-founder of WeWork — you know that lossmaking-property company — will receive a $185m “consulting fee” from SoftBank as part of a deal that will allow the supposedly visionary Japanese company to take control of the co-working business. And it’s not like other CEO pay where most of your compensation is tied up in the stock for that added incentive of making sure that the company you’re running actually performs well. Neumann is getting the $185m in cold, hard, cash. Nice work if you can get it. Then again, let’s not forget that Neumann is a guy who managed to get his own company to pay him $5.9m in stock to acquire the trademark “We”. At this point, every investment bank on the planet should be trying to retain Neumann’s services; just imagine what he could achieve as a sellside M&A banker. Neumann, of course, had a trump card to play to negotiate that $185m fee, which will cover four years of consulting for the company. SoftBank needed the co-founder to play nice and to agree to give up his high-vote shares. It gets better. Neumann has the option to sell $970m of his stock in the We Company to SoftBank. The Japanese group is also providing him a $500m credit line to help repay a loan extended by JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Credit Suisse.
 Don’t forget, Neumann already raised more than $700m through share sales and loans before WeWork’s now failed public listing. The generous “golden parachute” will see Neumann glide out of WeWork just before the company was about to go into freefall. That has naturally raised a lot of eyebrows: some WeWork shareholders are facing substantial losses, thousands of employees are at risk of losing their jobs and the company has lost $39bn in paper value in under a year. As part of operation rescue WeWork, SoftBank will inject $6.5bn into the company, including $5bn in debt, and an offer to buy up to $3bn of existing shares. The deal values the company at about $8bn.  Remember that the Japanese group pegged WeWork’s valuation at $47bn in January and various banks trying to woo Neumann and his company, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had pitched the company that it could be worth as much $104bn. Luckily for FT subscribers, over a year ago, our Lex column told you in a long-form piece that they valued the company at closer to $3bn. We don't predict a future in banking for our Lex colleagues. They’re too honest. Luckily, they continue to be very clever, including with their latest effort on WeWork here. JPMorgan had also put forward a rival rescue financing package but the Wall Street firm was unwilling to include the tender offer for existing shares as part of the package because the bank believed it overvalued WeWork’s equity and acted as a bailout to Neumann. What happens next with WeWork is anyone’s guess, but the company that was going to raise the world’s consciousness can forget about floating for the time being. News flash: SoftBank said it would “double down” on its investment in WeWork even as the Japanese telecoms-to-technology group revealed that a $9.5bn rescue refinancing would not give it full control of the cash-strapped co-working company. Read more here from DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.
 Swiss miss: the sun fades on Sunrise’s cable dreams Legendary dealmaker John Malone (pictured below) isn’t used to not getting his way, especially when he has an agreed deal on the table. But that’s what happened to the billionaire US cable cowboy in Switzerland this week.  As the FT’s Nic Fildes flagged for DD recently, the planned takeover of the Swiss cable business of Malone’s Liberty Global faced a critical shareholder vote by the acquiring group, Sunrise, a Swiss mobile company. But on Tuesday Sunrise cancelled its shareholder vote as it became clear that stockholders planned to reject the $6.3bn takeover. Sunrise, run by former EE chief executive Olaf Swantee, had been confident of saving the deal even after its largest shareholder Freenet, the German mobile phone reseller that holds 25 per cent of its stock, said it would vote against it. He was wrong. A disconsolate Swantee told the FT: “We’re back to square one.” As for Malone’s camp, Liberty Global chief executive Mike Fries was more optimistic. “This deal could come back to life,” he told the FT. “Nobody can argue with the industrial logic,” he said of the merging of cable and mobile networks across Europe. “UPC is the fulcrum asset.” There could yet be salt added to Sunrise’s wounds. Fries says that there are alternatives for Liberty Global beyond Sunrise. One option is Salt, a Swiss mobile operator owned by the French billionaire Xavier Niel, waiting in the wings as an alternative dance partner. Foodfight: the battle for Just Eat It’s shaping up to be London’s biggest bidding war since Comcast and Disney tussled over the European pay-TV group Sky a year ago. Except instead of fighting over a must-have broadcaster in a fierce global land grab between media giants, this time the target is . . . well, a sleepy, two-decade old, poorly run delivery food company?  On Tuesday South Africa’s Naspers 
launched a £4.9bn hostile takeover bid for the UK’s Just Eat. The Just Eat board has already rejected the all-cash offer made through Naspers’ Dutch-listed vehicle Prosus, saying it “significantly undervalued” the UK company, prompting the group to go public with its bid. Some investors in Just Eat have levelled the same criticism at Dutch company Takeaway.com, which in July agreed to merge with Just Eat in a low-premium, all-stock deal. The play for Dutch-listed Takeaway is to gain scale and rely on its well-respected founder to run the combined group and take a bigger slice of the food delivery pie from Uber and Deliveroo. (Here are the fees to banks, lawyers, etc on that deal.) But a poor run in Takeaway’s share price meant the value of its offer for Just Eat had weakened in recent weeks, opening the door for Prosus to approach. So far Prosus has made three bids, all rejected privately by Just Eat, including its most recent offer, which was once again rejected on Tuesday. Go deeper into how this may play out with this just published piece by the FT’s Tim Bradshaw and Arash Massoudi. Introducing Trade Secrets — a new daily briefing

"Manny Roman on the rejuvenation of bond giant Pimco","Chief   discusses Argentina,  US college admissions scandal and  Goldman Sachs playbook ","Pimco’s raid of Man Group for its chief executive three years ago caught many in the fund industry off guard — not least Manny Roman, who remembers receiving the call that would lead to him making the 5,500-mile switch from London to Newport Beach. “It came absolutely out of the blue,” he recalls. “For the life of me, I didn’t know why Pimco wanted to talk to me. I thought it was about a merger or something.” While in California on a business trip, Mr Roman met several Pimco executives, including Dan Ivascyn, the group’s chief investment officer. The pair hit it off instantly and now often sit next to each other in Pimco’s open plan office. “We saw the world in a very similar way and one thing led to another and I got excited about it. So I took the job,” Mr Roman adds.  At the time, Pimco, the world’s biggest bond manager, was still reeling from its acrimonious split from one-time star investor Bill Gross. Mr Roman, meanwhile, had forged a reputation at the much smaller Man Group as a turnround specialist, who had grown the listed hedge fund group’s assets by 38 per cent over three years, lifting its share price by 18 per cent. Mr Roman and Mr Ivascyn have since overseen a rejuvenation of Pimco. Mr Ivascyn’s funds were the best selling on both sides of the Atlantic in 2017. Heavy outflows followed in 2018, but Pimco roared back this year. Investors are piling into bond funds in anticipation of interest rate cuts and further monetary easing from central banks. Pimco’s success is down to its dedication to bonds, says Mr Roman. With $1.8tn under management, it is the only fund group in the global trillion dollar club that is focused solely on one asset class. “We’re not trying to be all things to all people, like Invesco, and we’re not trying to be a blend of passive, active and everything like BlackRock,” says the Frenchman. “We have a very defined strategy.”  The commitment to fixed income has not been without its tribulations. This summer Pimco’s fund managers loaded up on Argentine bonds, and were stung in August when investors stampeded out of Argentine assets following President Mauricio Macri’s defeat in primary elections. A person close to the business says not all Pimco’s fund managers were comfortable with the level of Pimco’s bets on Argentine bonds, which led to heated internal discussions. Mr Roman dismisses the impact of the crashing peso. “By our standard, it’s a very small position,” he says breezily. “We invest in emerging markets — some work, some don’t. We’re very committed to finding value in emerging markets, but it was sized properly.” Upon taking the Pimco job, Mr Roman said he “borrowed the Goldman playbook” and tried to bring back former company executives as advisers. He said he spent two and a half years trying to convince Bill Thompson, Pimco’s chief executive between 1993 and 2009, to return. In January, he rejoined as chairman emeritus and as strategic adviser to Mr Roman and Mr Ivascyn. Mohamed El-Erian, Mr Thompson’s successor, is chief economic adviser to Pimco’s parent, German insurer Allianz.  Two former Pimco executives, however, will not be returning: Mr Gross and Douglas Hodge, Mr Roman’s predecessor as chief executive. We’re not trying to be all things to all peopleManny Roman Mr Gross’s departure from Pimco five years ago was spectacular. He fell out with colleagues, sued the business for $81m and more than $100bn of investor capital followed him out the door. Mr Gross has since retired from managing money, having watched the value of his fund at Janus Henderson, his new employer, whittle away to less than $1bn this year. While Pimco has moved on from Mr Gross’s time, an explosive scandal surrounding Mr Hodge hangs over the business. In March, Mr Hodge was one of a handful of fund management executives that were arrested on suspicions of trying to game the US college admissions system. He is alleged to have used bribery to get two of his children into college “as purported athletic recruits” and to have considered the use of bribery to help a third child into college. Pimco later conceded it had invited William “Rick” Singer, the adviser at the centre of the scandal, to speak to staff on two occasions in the past decade but had no formal relationship with the counsellor.  Mr Roman is categorical that Mr Hodge has no future at Pimco, adding: “We truly believe it was a very isolated incident in his personal life, which has nothing to do with Pimco.” When pressed, he says Pimco carried out internal checks to make sure other staff were not implicated. “It really has nothing to do with Pimco and I would say emphatically that those are not our values,” he says. “Rick Singer had a legitimate business helping kids take SAT exams for admission into US college.”  Mr Hodge is contesting the charges. Mr Roman is a man at home in many settings, as comfortable talking central bank policy with the bond fund managers on Pimco’s trading desks as he is discussing his passions for fine wine and literature with his former fellow trustees of the Paris Review. In London, his friends included Jean Pierre Mustier, chief executive of UniCredit, and Tidjane Thiam, the Credit Suisse boss who is facing his own problems over a corporate spying scandal. They formed part of a group of cosmopolitan French intellectuals. During our interview on the 45th floor of Pimco’s midtown New York offices, we discover we were both regulars at a nearby raucous football bar, where he would be among a boisterous group of Paris Saint-Germain fans. At one point he reveals he was part of a consortium that considered buying Leeds United, the legendary British club that has languished in the lower ranks of England’s professional leagues for more than a decade. But he backed out of the deal after realising it would drain his personal wealth with little upside. The only asset he would ever buy for philanthropic reasons, he adds, is the Financial Times. “If I ever make enough money, I would buy it and make it free to read for everyone,” he says.

"‘Rhino bond’ breaks new ground in conservation finance","Investment returns linked to rise in population of the horned herbivore","Big Game, Big MoneySubtitles unavailable Conservationists have started marketing a five-year “rhino bond” which bankers say is the world’s first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species. Investors in the $50m bond will be paid back their capital and a coupon if African black rhino populations in five sites across Kenya and South Africa increase over five years. The yield will vary depending on changes in the rhino population, which has sharply declined since the 1970s. The bond is likely to have different categories of investment, with some investors taking a “first loss” position if rhino population targets are missed, according to Conservation Capital, the company arranging the offer. If rhino numbers drop, those investors will lose their money depending on the scale of the decline and the terms of their investment while investors in other categories will be repaid. Organisers say the structure — a so-called “outcome payments” model that has been used by other issuers to finance health and education projects — could revolutionise conservation financing as traditional donors such as governments and multilateral organisations will disburse money only on results. It could also bring the private sector into species protection in a new way, because the return on investment will comprise both a financial return and a measurable conservation objective. “There’s a $1bn-a-day funding shortfall for conservation and the traditional sources of conservation finance — philanthropists and donor agencies — are not going to be able to pick up the difference,” said Giles Davies, chief executive of Conservation Capital. 
  Black rhino numbers in Africa dwindled to 2,300 in the early 1990s from more than 63,000 in the 1970s, according to the International Rhino Foundation. The population is currently around 5,000, but poaching remains a significant threat. Dominic Jermey, director-general of the Zoological Society of London, the charity that runs London Zoo and which is managing the rhino bond initiative, expressed confidence that the bond would reach its target. Organisers are hoping to launch it in the first quarter of next year. “There are vast pools of capital looking for a home and post-Blue Planet II there’s great interest in sustainable conservation,” he said, referring to the UK TV documentary series presented by David Attenborough. 
 Conservation is usually financed either by direct donations or funding earmarked for specific “outputs”, such as building fences or training rangers. Hurdles for the backers of the rhino bond include persuading investors to take the upfront risk and convincing traditional donors to agree to a five-year deferred liability — longer than the usual practice of three to four years. “Once you get the change of mindset, people should look at it as a standard financial instrument,” Mr Jermey said. Institutional investors are beginning to express interest in the bond. Marisa Drew, chief executive of the impact advisory and finance department at Credit Suisse, said the bank saw the bond as a “unique concept” that unites a range of stakeholders and that the bank was considering acting as a syndication agent. “It is this type of innovative financing structure that is needed to tackle some of our most challenging conservation requirements,” she said. The British government is among potential donors that, through the environment department, has supported preparatory work on the bond. But no decisions have yet been taken on whether to get involved, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Tom Hall, the head of philanthropy services at UBS Wealth Management, said outcome payments were increasing in popularity, with some $600m being raised in the past year through the model. 
 “This has never been done before so the risks are around the ability of the organisations involved to deliver outcomes,” he said. “It’s not headline return that’s the challenge but the risk to capital and how you price that.”

"Stocks to watch: Tui, Umicore, Royal Mail, Pets at Home, Salzgitter","Weak US shale markets are hindering Weir’s chances of splitting up, says Peel Hunt","Tuesday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Tui hit a seven-month high on a reassuring trading update. Summer trends were as expected, with the holiday company’s full-year guidance unchanged. An improvement in late bookings reported last month had continued although management’s update on next year was cautious to reflect airline overcapacity, Brexit uncertainty and grounded Boeing jets.  “Today’s update serves to highlight what a different business Tui has become: hotel and cruise assets generate strong and stable cash flows and the capital structure is fit to manage the working capital strains that ultimately did for its one-time peer Thomas Cook. How much Tui benefits from Thomas Cook’s demise will depend on how capacity gets redeployed. Precedent dictates not to get too hopeful, but we would be surprised if there wasn’t at least some resulting capacity consolidation and relief for the sector.”Stifel Separately, UBS upgraded Tui from “sell” to “neutral” on Thomas Cook’s liquidation. Tui’s short-term profitability and free cash flow should improve, although by 2021 the benefit will be modest, it said, adding: “We expect in the context of low-entry barriers incremental capacity to come to the market over the next 12-24 months. We therefore assume the recovery in profitability will be short-lived before pressure on tour operator margins could re-emerge.” ● Umicore of Belgium led the Stoxx Europe 600 gainers after announcing a strategic partnership with LG Chem and said it would be supplying auto battery materials to the South Korean group for the next “several” years.  No pricing details were given for the take-or-pay contract for 125,000 metric tonnes of nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode materials, mostly supplied from Umicore’s new factory in Poland. There was no change to Umicore’s production target of 175,000 tonnes of cathode capacity by the end of 2021. Analysts said the amounts were sufficient to power more than 1m electric vehicles, which should increase certainty around Umicore’s expansion. But without knowing the structure of the contracts and the scope of the strategic partnership the deal was proving difficult to value. “Announcing contracts is the exception and not the norm and we believe this has been announced simply due to the magnitude. We believe the supply agreement is positive on guaranteed tonnage/offtake from its capacity additions. However, as oversupply concerns continue to weigh on global cathode markets, ultimate product pricing terms/potential impact on Umicore’s margins/implied return on capital still represents an overhang to the investment case.”Credit Suisse Sellside stories ● Morgan Stanley downgraded Pets at Home from “equal weight” to “underweight” with a 150p-a-share target. Like-for-like sales growth may have improved and short sellers have been closing out positions, but a “runaway” share price has ignored the fundamental challenges faced by the retailer, it said. “Pets at Home shares have almost doubled since the start of this year. Earnings expectations have increased but only marginally, so this has mostly come from re-rating and the shares are now trading at more than 16 times consensus earnings — a high multiple, we believe, for a retailer that has delivered no earnings growth over the five years since it IPO’d.”Morgan Stanley Pets at Home has started to shrink selling space and has only just begun reshaping its vets division, the broker added. It said that retail gross margins of more than 50 per cent were unlikely to be sustained in the long term. However, the broker also advised patience. “Whilst we have a high level of conviction that Pets at Home shares have become overvalued in recent months, we believe that they will likely remain so until like-for-like growth normalises and we have rather less conviction as to when this will happen,” it said. ● Peel Hunt downgraded Weir Group, the pump maker, from “buy” to “hold” with a £15.85 target. Earnings volatility caused by Weir’s Oil & Gas division “detracts from the stock’s core investment proposition”, it said. “The commentary around US shale has continued to deteriorate in terms of the rig count, spending plans and the debt profile of many US energy companies. In turn, this makes us believe that Weir’s Oil & Gas guidance for the current year might be slightly optimistic, and more significantly, that the run-rate trajectory into 2020 with consensus expecting a 31 per cent uplift in profitability might not be achieved.”Peel Hunt Many of Weir’s peer group have sought to separate their oil and gas units, including Atlas-Copco, Metso, TechnipFMC and Dover Corporation, Peel Hunt said. But the broker cautioned that Weir’s exposure to a shale market in decline would make following the same path challenging. “It is clear what has to happen, but how does Weir execute such a plan against the current North American shale market backdrop?” ● Liberum downgraded Royal Mail from “hold” to “sell” with a 185p target price. Its downgrade followed The Communication Workers Union this week balloting 110,000 postal workers about a possible national strike over issues including working hours. “Royal Mail’s ongoing dispute with its workforce poses significant problems, even if industrial action going into the peak season can be avoided. The dispute signifies a breakdown in co-operation between management and staff, which bodes ill for business-as-usual productivity improvements. In our view, the recent share price strength is completely at odds with the deteriorating industrial relations picture and weakening macro outlook, and the valuation wholly unreflective of the structural challenges faced by the group that could lead to a long-term and irreversible squeeze of profit margins.”Liberum Daily newsletter

"Dispute between UBS and sports owner shows fragility of banker fees","Hard work does not always lead to a big payday for Wall Street firms","The workload for Wall Street investment bankers is crushing, even when the chance of a really big fee is rare. Credit Suisse bankers who advised Chevron on its broken $50bn deal for Anadarko Petroleum will lament a perhaps once-in-a-lifetime $50m payday. Hence the strenuous efforts bankers will undertake to make sure their work is rewarded. Take a lawsuit involving Credit Suisse’s rival, UBS.  In the summer of 2005, a team from the bank was present when Dan Snyder, the billionaire owner of the Washington DC National Football League team, and his closest business associates, assembled at the 200-year old New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.  Mr Snyder was launching an offensive on Six Flags, the amusement park chain, to seize a handful of board seats through his investment firm, RedZone LLC. Also flanking Mr Snyder that afternoon was Dennis Block, a legendary Wall Street lawyer at Cadwalader. Mr Snyder had even agreed to sit for an interview with the Wall Street Journal in hopes of winning the hearts of Six Flags shareholders. The Six Flags proxy contest launched by Mr Snyder that afternoon was his Plan B. RedZone had first hoped to acquire the company by purchasing it in a traditional buyout. However, its $2.6bn in borrowings was known as “poison debt” that, under a change of control, would have to be refinanced, an impossibility given its financial condition. As a back-up plan, Mr Snyder sought to win a minority of seats on the board. But before the opening salvo could be fired that afternoon, there was a problem. UBS believed that the technical language in its contract with Mr Snyder’s investment firm RedZone LLC entitled it to a $10m deal fee, a figure that outraged the NFL owner. The parties would go on to hastily revise the terms of the engagement, seemingly limiting to $2m what Mr Snyder owned. Yet two years later, UBS sued Mr Snyder contending it was entitled to the original $10m. The resulting litigation would persist until late 2018. Legal doctrine aside, the thick record of filings are a rare window into the awkward ways in which bankers must earning a living and the ill will that creates with the CEOs whose best interests they are supposed to be representing. The biggest fees in investment banking are typically triggered when large amounts of money change hands; either a company raises big dollars or a company is bought or sold. Yet that afternoon, UBS noticed that its contract with Mr Snyder — called an engagement letter — appeared to indicate that it was owed the $10m transaction fee simply if its director candidates were elected. Mr Snyder was, perhaps understandably, upset that his approximate 10 per cent stake in Six Flags that he spent $40m on could create a liability a quarter of that figure to a bank. Court filings recount the profanity-laced negotiations that afternoon where thereafter UBS agreed to cap its fee on the proxy contest at a modest $2m. Mr Snyder eventually won the consent solicitation and by 2006 had installed most of the RedZone board.  In 2007, however, UBS changed its posture and sued to collect its $10m fee. A New York state judge eventually agreed with UBS, ruling that the revised engagement letter with the capped fee applied only to the original proxy fight. When Mr Snyder later took control of the board, the $10m fee to UBS now applied. And while the legal dispute concluded as a straightforward application of contract law, the drama behind the scenes was more complicated. When UBS had agreed to the lower $2m fee in 2005, it thought it had a handshake agreement with Mr Snyder that his future deals would belong to UBS to compensate for the $10m. And yet Mr Snyder never delivered those future mandates, according to UBS, prompting the lawsuit.  In his deposition, Mr Block, the Cadwalader attorney, recalled UBS’s posture on its fee on the fateful August 2005 afternoon. Jeffrey Sine, the senior UBS executive, “talked about what a great job he felt UBS had done up until that point in time, how much resources he felt [UBS] had given to this project and that he felt having UBS as an adviser lent a lot of credibility to the ongoing effort by RedZone to be successful here . . . ” explained Mr Block. UBS had done an enormous amount of work advising Mr Snyder on Six Flags. But that work would pay off with a massive fee only if RedZone purchased Six Flags. When it became clear Mr Snyder was not retaining UBS again, litigating for the fee proved worthwhile.  Mr Snyder later turned his sights on Mr Block, suing Cadwalader for malpractice over the allegedly deficient engagement letter that cost him $10m. That lawsuit ultimately settled late in 2018 with an undisclosed payment from the firm to Mr Snyder. Mr Snyder and Cadwalader declined to comment.  In a statement UBS said “the legal matter was resolved over a decade ago in our favour and we continue to be pleased that the court agreed with our position”, adding that fee arrangements had since changed. “To draw conclusions about current fee practices from that long ago is absurd,” it said. Another twist in the tale: Six Flags filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Ironically, Mr Snyder was then far better off from failing to make a formal purchase of the amusement park, even as he had been forced to pay his bankers a fee that reflected he had bought the whole company. ","24.05.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Ocado, Ferrexpo, Deutsche Bank, WPP, IAG, Next","HomeServe’s accounting policies raise red flags, says HSBC","Monday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● Ocado was among the FTSE 100 fallers after revealing in a shareholder circular that an electrical fault in a battery charging unit caused the fire at its Andover depot in February. The fault ignited a plastic lid on a grocery-carrying robot that served “no practical purpose”, it said. The circular also gave more detail on Ocado’s UK groceries joint venture with Marks and Spencer. Under the terms of the deal 25 per cent of the £750m being paid by M&S would be deferred, the bulk of which to be paid in 2023 depending on the venture hitting 80 per cent of Ocado’s operating profit target. ● Ferrexpo rallied after the iron ore miner defended its handling of an investigation into potential misuse of charity payments, which last week led to the resignation of its auditor Deloitte.  Deloitte said it quit because it was unable to determine whether Kostyantin Zhevago, Ferrexpo’s chief executive and majority shareholder, controlled the Blooming Land charity and had asked the company repeatedly to launch an independent investigation. Ferrexpo said it had considered starting a formal review in response to Deloitte’s concerns but decided that a “co-operative route” would get better results. “The board needs to re-establish market credibility at speed in our view,” said Barclays. It saw as potential actions launching a share buyback, concluding the forensic investigation as soon as possible, appointing a credible new auditor and re-establishing a majority of independent non-executive directors on the board.  “Ultimately, we think the main point is that Ferrexpo ceased contributions to Blooming Land in May 2018, the amounts involved are negligible ($10m donated in the first half 2018) and the go-forward cash impact on the business and hence valuation impact is zero,” said Barclays. With Ferrexpo having lost 21 per cent of its market value since Friday morning, immediate action can lift the valuation “close to prior levels at a time when [iron ore] pellet markets are experiencing their most buoyant conditions in 10 years”, it said. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse downgraded Deutsche Bank to “underperform” from “neutral” with a €6.5 price target. It cited the lack of a plan B following the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank, as well as structurally low profitability and high funding costs.  “Despite Deutsche’s weak profitability, it declined (for now) to offer any strategic update to improve returns. We think it will continue to lose market share in trading as it needs to continue to cut expenses amid elevated funding costs and improve its leverage ratio. While Deutsche Asset Management is considering some merger and acquisition options to improve its profitability, we do not think any developments will be sufficiently material to improve Deutsche’s valuation.”Credit Suisse Even at 0.3 times tangible book value, Deutsche’s valuation was not cheap enough given a return on tangible equity of just 1 per cent this year, the broker said. “Deutsche’s falling profitability has seen it move to a price-to-earnings premium to both its history and to the sector. Our new price target assumes it would return to its long-run average.”  ● Barclays upgraded WPP to “overweight” from “equal weight” with an £11 price target.   WPP’s second-quarter organic sales should be no worse than the first quarter before improving in the second half, which should be seen positively if all advertising agencies reported a similar stabilisation, said Barclays. The broker also expected WPP’s sale of its Kantar market research division to be a positive catalyst, given doubts in the market about whether it could get an acceptable price.  Management’s turnround strategy “looks sensible” with its focus on developing technology, simplifying the group structure and accepting lower margins to recruit creative talent, Barclays said. The long-term targets have been set at realistic levels yet the shares are “very cheap” at just over eight times 2019 earnings, a 23 per cent discount to peers, Barclays added. The near record-low valuation was “pricing negative growth rate and margin contraction forever”, it said. ● UBS upgraded International Consolidated Airlines Group, the British Airways owner, to “buy” from “neutral” with a 705p target. A year to date 20 per cent drop had put IAG back to trough valuation multiples, suggesting downside should be limited even though consensus forecasts had further to fall, it said. Summer demand should be helped by “less geopolitical uncertainty in the UK” and improved North Atlantic route pricing, said UBS. The broker also saw evidence that with high fuel prices came European capacity discipline, both for long- and short-haul flights.  Based on management’s 2023 financial targets IAG would be “materially undervalued”, UBS said, adding: “We continue to believe IAG is the best of breed operator amongst the network operators and think the dividend (51.5 euro cents) and investment-grade balance sheet underpin the company.” ● HSBC downgraded HomeServe to “reduce” from “hold” with a £10 target price in a note questioning the home repairs insurer’s accounting policies. Homeserve’s intangible assets are 140 per cent the size of its balance sheet, which distorts profitability, returns and cash flow HSBC highlighted. In particular, it highlighted the group’s customer acquisition strategy outside the UK, where marketing channels are less mature.  “HomeServe regularly buys existing customer books from future utility partners. As they also form the basis of a new marketing partnership, they look the same as organic agreements. The amortisation and capital expenditure costs are, however, treated as non-operational merger and acquisition items and hence stripped out of adjusted earnings and free cash flow.”HSBC HomeServe’s 2016 acquisition of US peer Utility Service Partners and its partnership a year later with Dominion Energy suggest the “presentational” gap between organic and inorganic capitalised customer acquisition costs would widen, HSBC said. It estimated that by 2020 the group amortisation charge would account for about 7 per cent of adjusted operating profit. HSBC also highlighted that goodwill made up half of HomeServe’s intangible assets. This was likely to include a UK furniture warranty business, which was exited more than five years ago yet remains on the balance sheet to drag on invested capital returns, it said. Amortisation of a delayed software rollout would be a further headwind for operating earnings, the broker said. At 29 times forward earnings, HomeServe was “starting to look expensive” versus its average last year of 24.5 times earnings, HSBC added.  ● In brief: Avio rated new “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Barry Callebaut raised to “overweight” at Barclays; Computacenter raised to “buy” at UBS; DFS Furniture cut to “hold” at Stifel; Elisa raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Iberdrola downgraded to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Ingenico raised to “outperform” at Macquarie; M6 downgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Mind Gym raised to “buy” at Liberum; Neste downgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux and Société Générale; Next cut to “hold” at Stifel; Novo Nordisk upgraded to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Rotork upgraded to “hold” at Investec; Sampo cut to “hold” at HSBC.

"Rip-roaring bond rally revives talk of ‘widow-maker’ trade","Shorting debt is back on the agenda as investors bet global growth fears are overdone","Every investor has one trade that they rue more than any other. The most famous “widow-maker” trade in financial markets — one that has frustrated generations of money managers — is betting against Japanese government bonds.  Yields have sagged to eye-popping lows for the past three decades, even as government debts have risen, repeatedly tempting traders into “shorting” Japanese debt. Yet time and time again yields have only dipped lower, inflicting painful losses on successive generations of money managers. But some investors are now starting to contemplate what could be this era’s ultimate ruinous trade: leaning against the ferocious, broad-based rally in government bonds, betting that the spreading pessimism over global growth has become overdone. “There are quite a lot of inflationary pressures behind the deflationary pressures of the downturn,” said Crispin Odey, the head of Odey Asset Management, who built up large short positions on Japanese and UK government bonds. Many investors point out that just because bonds are expensive, it does not mean that they cannot become even more expensive. But it is clear that government debt has rarely been this pricey — if ever. Clifford Asness, the chief executive and founder of New York’s AQR Capital Management, has constructed a measure of bond market valuations that combines the so-called US “yield curve” — the shape formed by Treasury yields of various maturities — and real yields, or those adjusted for inflation. His conclusion: bonds are “frickin' expensive”.  In a report last week, Mr Asness noted that his blended measure is at a 64-year low, with a value not seen save for a couple of months in the late 1970s. “Pretty wild considering some of the times we’ve lived through,” Mr Asness wrote. “When something as important as the US bond yield hits historical extremes, it’s worth at least a discussion, though certainly not an automatic huge short.” Mindful of the infamous widow-maker trade, Mr Asness points out that JGBs have been “incredibly expensive since many of today’s traders were in short pants”. However, some money managers are beginning to ratchet back their exposure, or even building some cautious short positions. BlueBay Asset Management, which manages $64bn in assets, is betting against short-dated US Treasuries and 10-year UK gilts. “We think yields are too low in the US, as we feel that recession risk is overpriced,” said Mark Dowding, BlueBay’s chief investment officer. “In the UK, yields also look too low as we see fiscal stimulus and a possible election that could lead to a change of government.” Many investors remain wary of outright shorts in government debt, wary of the lessons of Japan, but several big investment groups have ratcheted back their exposure, such as Pimco, Barings, Allianz Global Investors and Fidelity International.  “We remain positive on US Treasuries, although we have taken profits lately given the size of the moves that we have seen,” said Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity in London. Barings had an outsized position in government debt last year, relative to benchmarks, but has heavily pared its positions in major markets and now has “very little” exposure, according to Christopher Mahon, director of asset allocation research at the London-based $325bn asset manager.  “When you get such a pronounced move over such a short space of time there’s always a risk you get a snap back,” said Mike Riddell, portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors.  “All the momentum money is going to be long bonds. If you start to see European data improve or commodity prices rising we would get very worried about the risk of another tantrum [like the one in the Bund market in early 2015]. That would make me very nervous about being long,” Mr Riddell said. This year has certainly seen a powerful fixed income rally, pushing the yields of the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse index — the broadest bond market gauge that tracks more than $58tn of debt — down from a high of over 2.5 per cent last autumn to near the all-time low of 1.4 per cent touched in 2016. The widespread expectations that interest rates and bond yields are heading even lower is evident in Bank of America’s latest monthly investor survey. The net number of fund managers who think monetary policy is going to get even easier hit its highest level since November 2008. Yet at the same time, there are concerns over whether the rip-roaring bond rally can be sustained. The BofA survey indicates that investors think buying US Treasuries is the most crowded trade in financial markets at the moment, while a significant share consider government and high-grade corporate debt to be vulnerable to a bubble. “Yields are overshooting,” said James Sweeney, chief US economist and chief investment officer for the Americas at Credit Suisse. “If we have a rebound in . . . manufacturing activity, which may be triggered by some good news on the trade front, it's likely that you'll have a serious reversal in yields. It looks like there’s an opportunity now to go the other way.” Additional reporting by Tommy Stubbington

"Strain on WeWork intensifies as CEOs race to secure new financial backstop","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. The financial strain on WeWork has only become more apparent in the days since the lossmaking group pulled its initial public offering, jettisoned co-founder Adam Neumann from the chief executive role and failed to secure a $6bn loan from Wall Street. The latest sign of trouble this week came from the rating agency Fitch, which projected the company’s cash pile had fallen to $1.5bn at the end of September from $2.5bn a quarter earlier. Fitch swiftly slashed WeWork’s debt rating deeper into junk territory and warned of “material” cash charges as the company readies for sweeping cuts to its 12,500-plus workforce.  The company’s debt has been in a near freefall since the IPO collapsed, and was trading hands at less than 85 cents on the dollar this week. That pushed the spread on the bonds above 1,000 basis points over comparably maturing US Treasuries. It is a metric worth noting; investors in the $9.5tn US corporate bond market now judge WeWork to be in distress.  Short sellers have piled in, and the debt has become among the most expensive corporate bonds to short, according to IHS Markit. More than 10 per cent of WeWork’s debt was now on loan, a proxy for how intense short interest in the company’s debt is, DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Joe Rennison were first to report. That was a record level.  The pressure is now on for new WeWork CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham to find a financial lifeline. The company is in talks with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as several other banks, for some lending package. Expect it to be far, far smaller than the $6bn financing it had earlier agreed, sources tell DD. DD has already told you that SoftBank 
considered pumping extra money into WeWork, given it has billions of dollars riding on the property group’s success. The company is also in talks to sell off a handful of companies that it has recently acquired, including Managed by Q, Meetup, Conductor, SpaceIQ and Teem, as well as its stake in The Wing. Even then, the heat on Minson and Gunningham will not abate (and we’re not talking about from the thousands of WeWork employees who saw their stock options plunge in value). Rival IWG is looking to double its growth rate and ramp up its expansion as WeWork struggles. IWG, it’s worth mentioning, is profitable. IWG boss Mark Dixon (pictured below) sat down with the FT and laid out one of the key problems with WeWork’s business model, which includes free beer and kombucha on tap.  “Essentially, the space is a break-even business and the profit comes from the services,” he said. “It’s like running a hotel and giving away the room service and having a free bar. You will have a very popular hotel but you won’t make any money.” The mega-deal spawns the mega-class in Big Law The partnership at Kirkland & Ellis is growing in record fashion. This week the law firm promoted the largest partner class in its history. More than 140 attorneys joined the partnership, triple the class size it promoted a decade ago. Kirkland, which generated more revenue than any other law firm in the world, has nabbed some of the marquee deal assignments this year. It ranks second only to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in the M&A legal tables through the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data.  The promotions at Kirkland come amid a wave of lateral hirings across Big Law. DD has counted at least a dozen lateral partner hires announced this week. The departures have only reinforced the view that the law firm partnership, once considered sacrosanct, no longer holds the same meaning it once did. The promotions from Kirkland — which partially overshadowed smaller new partner classes at Goodwin (33 partner promotions) and Covington & Burling (14 promotions) — drew some scrutiny. The majority of additions to Kirkland’s partnership were men, and the class was predominantly white, according to the Above the Law blog.  It’s one point that Covington heralded in its announcement: its latest class was its most diverse ever. Almost two-thirds of the attorneys it promoted to partner were women. It is a point that is increasingly important to big corporate clients that are evaluating who they take advice from. Who’s buying direct listings? Investment bankers were a popular target for the venture capitalists that gathered in San Francisco this week to discuss direct listings, the buzzy Silicon Valley alternative to traditional initial public offerings.  But another powerful group was also top of mind: large mutual funds and institutional investors such as Fidelity that can make or break newly listed companies. Backers of direct listings argue the process, in which pre-existing shares are released to the highest public bidders, results in a more diverse and committed investor base. But so far the two largest examples, Slack and Spotify, are trading below the prices of their first day as a public listed company, giving fuel to critics of the IPO alternative.  Manny Medina, CEO of the $1.1bn software company Outreach, told DD’s Miles Kruppa that “chatter in the room” focused on the buyside question.  In traditional public offerings, the thinking goes, companies can use their roadshows to target blue-chip investors, while direct listings largely foreclose that possibility. Others argue there are increasing opportunities to attract large investors as the likes of Fidelity and T Rowe Price dip further into private technology companies. Some direct listing proponents go as far as saying large mutual funds collude with bankers to underprice IPOs and create first-day “pops”, which could instead be going towards the issuer’s coffers. DD would like to see some evidence before drawing any conclusions on this matter. Read more here.

"Largest oil refinery on US east coast for sale after blasts","Fiery conclusion to years of financial duress for Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery","The largest oil refinery on the US east coast is up for sale less than a week after explosions destroyed an expensive piece of equipment, marking a fiery conclusion to years of financial duress.  The Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery has been rescued repeatedly in the past decade by a private investor, government assistance and a bankruptcy court as its managers tried to manoeuvre through a radically shifting oil market.  Mark Smith, PES chief executive, on Wednesday announced the refinery would shut down. “The recent fire at the refinery complex has made it impossible for us to continue operations,” he said, adding that the company would “position the refinery complex for a sale and restart”.  Fears about the fire had already prompted a scramble to convey petrol to US east coast cities at the start of the summer holiday driving season. More than 6m barrels of petrol was leaving Europe in the week to last Friday, more than double the previous week, according to Genscape, a commodities data company. New York gasoline futures have rallied 13.5 per cent in the past week to almost $2 a gallon.  Mason Hamilton, senior petroleum markets analyst at the US Energy Information Administration, said: “If PES does shut down, you have a 335,000 barrel per day hole in your US east coast mid-Atlantic supply chain. You’ve got to figure out how to fill it.”   The shutdown and sale is the latest twist for a plant on the meanders of the Schuylkill river that dates to Pennsylvania’s 19th century oil boom.  Hit by depressed fuel demand after the financial crisis, the refinery was earmarked for closure before its sale to a joint venture of Carlyle Group, the private equity firm, and former owner Sunoco, aided by $25m in grants from the state of Pennsylvania and tax and regulatory relief.  It flourished in the early days of the US shale drilling surge as domestic crude supplies rose and a ban on exports “kept shale oil production trapped in the US and enabled refineries to get their hands on it at a very deep discount,” said Antoine Halff, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.  The ban was lifted in late-2015, however, and midstream energy built more pipeline capacity from inland shale fields to the US Gulf of Mexico coast. Refineries on the east coast were bypassed and forced to hire more expensive US-flagged vessels to carry in oil from Texas. “This competitive advantage has shrunk to nothing,” Mr Halff said.  Last week traders and producers exported a record 3.8m b/d of US crude oil, data released on Wednesday showed.  The refinery company filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2018, emerging from court in August with investors Credit Suisse Asset Management and Bardin Hill together owning a majority stake, and relieved of half of the $350m it owed on biofuels blending credits it was obliged to purchase under a US renewable fuels mandate. Executives pledged to preserve jobs and invest in the business.  However, the company’s finances continued to deteriorate. In March, its cash balance totalled $85.8m, down from $148.8m just after leaving bankruptcy, according to court filings.  Fires early last Friday began in a tank and spread to a 20,000 b/d alkylation unit, which makes petrol blendstock, Genscape reported. John Auers, executive vice-president at Turner Mason, a consultancy, said replacing such a unit could cost $200m-$300m.  Even before the fire, the refinery was “marginal in a market that is oversupplied — the Atlantic basin”, he said.  The refinery’s tank complex could be repurposed as a storage terminal or used to export crude, Mr Auers said. Another former Sunoco refinery in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, closed down earlier in the decade and now exports hydrocarbons from the nearby Marcellus Shale formation.  In the short term, petroleum products markets will need to adjust to a sudden loss of supply at the start of the summer holiday driving season. In addition to cargoes from Europe, petrol may flow from Texas via the massive Colonial Pipeline or from a refinery in Atlantic Canada.  Stocks of petrol blending components on the US east coast stood at 57.1m barrels in data recorded just before the refinery explosion, down from 62.3m a year before.  “It’s going to change the dynamics dramatically,” said Joe Raia, managing director for energy at futures broker RJ O’Brien.","27.06.2019"
"Banks brace for closure of EU currency manipulation probe","Last major regulator to wrap investigation into claims traders rigged markets","After six years of scrutiny, billions of dollars in fines and a flurry of criminal lawsuits, the world’s biggest currency-dealing banks are finally close to drawing a line under global regulatory investigations into the behaviour of their traders, as the EU prepares to announce the results of its probes. The EU is the last major regulatory authority to conclude its investigation into claims that traders manipulated major currency benchmarks and exchange rates — allegations that first surfaced in 2013. Brussels’ findings, and potential fines, are due to land this month, several people familiar with the matter said. UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Barclays and HSBC, each of which began negotiating a settlement with the EU in 2017, are in the spotlight. The banks all declined to comment. “The feeding frenzy that started six years ago is . . . coming to an end,” said one former banker. “But where the shoe could drop next is civil cases in Europe.” Authorities in the UK, US, Switzerland and Singapore started giving out a total of more than $10bn in fines to 15 banks from late 2014, while investigations have also led to multibillion-dollar settlements in civil cases. The global foreign exchange probe initially focused on a key benchmark published daily at 4pm London time. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority issued its largest fine in November 2014 when it imposed over £1.1bn of penalties on the same group of banks, with a later £280m fine for Barclays. On the same day, US regulators levied fines totalling $2.1bn on a similar group of dealers. In Switzerland, regulator Finma issued a penalty of $138m on UBS. But the EU’s complex process covering several currencies has been held up, in part because of Credit Suisse’s decision to withdraw from the settlement. A recent decision by the European Court of Justice meant that the EU can no longer announce a cartel settlement if any of the parties decides not to settle, so authorities had to conduct a full investigation before making the settlement announcement. The Swiss bank declined to comment on the matter. By choosing to settle with EU regulators, banks can reduce their fines by 10 per cent and speed up resolutions. Settling the charges also avoids a detailed statement of facts that can provide ammunition for any potential claimants seeking damages. While the EU’s decision will mark the end of the regulatory scrutiny, it will still not fully close the matter. In November last year, a lawsuit was filed in the US against some banks on behalf of several investment managers, following an earlier class action lawsuit that resulted in banks settling similar claims for $2.3bn. In December, law firm Quinn Emanuel filed a claim for damages in London in a 200-page document against RBS, UBS, HSBC, Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan, alleging that they manipulated the currencies markets, according to Boris Bronfentrinker, a partner at the law firm. The claim is seeking damages for heavy-hitting investors including Allianz Global Investors, PIMCO, Brevan Howard and the Norwegian state pension fund. Legal risks also remain for a small number of former FX traders. Three of them, from Citi, JPMorgan and Barclays, were found not guilty of antitrust violations in a related US court case last October. Former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, meanwhile, is scheduled for an appeal hearing against his guilty verdict on May 31. His case, while not directly related to the benchmarks under regulatory scrutiny, stems from the heightened focus on traders’ behaviour that has been sparked by the investigations. Since the allegations about price rigging first came to light, major central banks together with dealers and investors created the FX Global Code of Conduct under the supervision of the Bank for International Settlements, in an attempt to reform practices in the space. The European Commission declined to comment. Litany of FX litigation © Reuters June 2013

"More savings will make the retirement crisis worse","Diversified yield-biased strategies and low-cost annuities are a client need and business opportunity","It is a truism that the developed world faces a retirement crisis. Discussion centres on what is termed the “problem of longevity” as well as people having too little money saved for retirement. Living longer seems a good thing, so the economic system needs to adapt to make it work. However, the extent of inadequate savings is shown in the small balances in defined contribution (DC) plans and in low solvency levels in defined benefit (DB) plans. The 10-year recovery from the global financial crisis has not fully repaired the solvency of DB plans. Though asset values have risen, persistently low interest rates make pensions more costly. Many DB plans have reduced their valuation interest rates but, for example, 8.5 per cent to 7 per cent seems inadequate when the US risk-free rate, for a 10-year bond, is only 2.2 per cent. In other countries the rates are even lower.  Low interest rates also make the provision of pensions using DC balances both expensive and risky. The usual response to such issues is to advocate that people save more, so increasing DC balances and DB solvency. This, though, could make the situation worse: there is already a surplus of savings over capital investment and a boom in investment looks unlikely since technology has made business less capital intensive. Greater savings would increase surplus liquidity and probably push interest rates and bond yields down — making pensions even more expensive. Enough of the negative . . . let’s stress the positive, which leads me to two suggestions.  When retirement ages were originally fixed, usually at 60 or 65, those ages were close to the average life expectancy. Now many people’s retirement lasts nearly as long as their working life. Continuing the move to later retirement seems essential.  Fortunately overall health is improving and many people will welcome the opportunity to continue working. I suggest, however, that employers and governments must try harder to reduce age discrimination.   The optimal diverse workforce will have a greater age range. There are occupations where physical effort dictates earlier retirement but people in these jobs often take up a second career. My second suggestion is both an opportunity and a challenge for retirement plan providers and asset managers.  There are good solutions already for investment management for DC plans during the accumulation phase, for example through target date funds in the US. The payout phase globally remains a work in progress.  Developing diversified yield-biased strategies and better structures such as low-cost annuities sounds like both a client need and a business opportunity.

 Russian president Vladimir Putin sat down with FT editor Lionel Barber to discuss the failings of liberal ideology, Anglo-Russian relations and the most closely guarded secret in Russia — who will succeed him?
 In an exclusive FT interview in the Kremlin on the eve of the G20 summit in Osaka, Vladimir Putin said “the liberal idea” had “outlived its purpose” as public opinion turns against immigration and multiculturalism.  “[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting to do over the recent decades,” he said.  Mr Putin’s evisceration of liberalism as a spent ideological force chimes with his support for anti-establishment nationalist movements in Europe and the US.

"Metro rejects takeover offer from Czech billionaire","Proposal ‘substantially undervalues’ German retailer, board says","German retailer Metro AG has rejected a €5.8bn takeover offer from an investment vehicle controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, arguing it “substantially undervalues” the Düsseldorf-based company. EP Global Commerce, which is controlled by Mr Kretinsky and his Slovakian business partner Patrik Tkac, said on Friday night that it would offer €16 in cash for each Metro share it does not already own, and €13.80 for each preference share. A deal would mark the latest foray into western Europe by Mr Kretinsky, the chairman of football club AC Sparta Prague who last year bought a stake in the French daily Le Monde via his Czech Media Invest vehicle. He is best known in European dealmaking circles for his purchases of energy assets in Germany, Italy and the UK through EPH, a group he founded in 2009. In a statement, EP Global Commerce said it had secured backing representing more than 31 per cent of Metro’s shares through irrevocable commitments and options. But on Sunday, Metro argued that the offer represents a premium of 3 per cent on Friday’s closing price. “The Management Board strongly believes that the offer [ . . .] substantially undervalues the company and does not reflect its value creation plan,” it said, adding that it would continue to “take decisive actions to transform the wholesale and food specialist and effectively position it for the changing market environment”. The company said it would assess the offer once it had received all the documentation, but advised shareholders not to sell to Mr Kretinsky and Mr Tkac in the mean time. The takeover offer will be subject to a minimum acceptance threshold that so far has not been specified. A person briefed on the matter told the Financial Times that it will be between 60 and 75 per cent of Metro’s share capital. The offer will be financed partly by loans provided by BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Société Générale. Mr Kretinsky said his vehicle had secured the support of Metro shareholder Haniel, which owns a 15.2 per cent stake, in the form of an irrevocable commitment. A person familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that EP was legally required to buy Haniel’s remaining stake only if the minimum acceptance threshold was crossed. “Metro needs to regain the capability to swiftly react to the dynamically changing market environment. This requires implementation of a number of initiatives in its organisation, business and processes,” EP Global Commerce said. “Without the capability to execute such changes, the company would be exposed to significant risks due to stagnant or declining results.” Shares in Metro have climbed 45 per cent over the past year, closing at €15.55 on Friday, meaning that the offer represents a thin premium. EP Global Commerce said its offer was 34.5 per cent premium to when it first entered the stock in August. Metro generated €36.5bn in global revenue in the last financial year, a 1.6 per cent drop compared with the previous year, but pre-tax profits fell 10.9 per cent to €578m. Metro was once a retail conglomerate with activities stretching from electronics to department stores, but under chief executive Olaf Koch it has been offloading assets in a bid to focus on its food business.

"Stocks to watch: Tui, easyJet, Hurricane Energy, Sainsbury, Prosus","EssilorLuxottica’s governance clean-up leaves stock undervalued, says Morgan Stanley","Monday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Tui led the FTSE 100 gainers as the collapse of Thomas Cook raised hopes of tighter package holiday capacity and improved pricing. Tui and Thomas Cook overlap in key markets including the UK, Germany and the Nordics, said Barclays. It forecast that if Tui picked up £2bn of lost Thomas Cook revenue it would be worth an extra 4 per cent to group trading profit. “However, whilst the benefit to Tui could be material, the issues TCG has faced only serve to highlight how challenged the tour operating business is from a structural perspective. So while Tui may benefit, investors are unlikely to immediately become fully comfortable owning Tui, particularly given the immediate uncertainties ahead.” ● On The Beach edged higher even after cautioning that it would book the cost of covering Thomas Cook’s cancelled flights as a one-off exceptional, as well as losing margin on cancelled bookings. The costs could be up to £7m, or a fifth of adjusted annual pre-tax profit, analysts said. Historically, between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of OTB bookings have included a Thomas Cook flight, according to Liberum. Short-term disruption was inevitable but flight schedules should have evened out by the summer 2020 season and “with the 2.5m former Thomas Cook passengers up for grabs, this should then become a major tailwind,” it said. “Hence, this event will likely change the shape of 2020 but overall could end up neutral for the year ahead.” ● EasyJet and Ryanair led gains among the airline stocks. Thomas Cook accounted for about 1.5 per cent of European short-haul capacity from the UK in the winter, rising to about 3 per cent in the summer, analysts said. Its failure follows on the heels of French airlines Aigle Azur and XL Airways that ceased trading. “This autumn shake-out is earlier than usual (late October/November tends to be the airline liquidity low point). While distressing news for passengers and holidaymakers, longer-term an earlier shake-out likely leads to less risk of irrational fare pricing (cash flow raising rather than profit making) affecting this winter . . .  For easyJet we think this does suggest a more rational winter is ahead, but beyond that, how [airport landing] slots and capacity is recycled back into the market will be key. History here suggests that capacity will not disappear, but return in just a slightly more consolidated form.”RBC Sellside stories ● Morgan Stanley upgraded glasses maker EssilorLuxottica from “neutral” to “overweight” with a €143-a-share target price. Improved corporate governance has helped bolster confidence in merger synergies being delivered, with the blue-sky scenario of perfect execution offering more than 50 per cent upside, it said.  EssilorLuxottica is “a unique, vertically integrated player with a dominant position in an industry exposed to structural growth drivers”, said Morgan Stanley. Underperformance versus best-in-class consumer and medical technology players over the past year has left the stock no more expensive than its main peers even though it offers greater opportunities to create value and a sector-leading free cash flow yield in excess of 5 per cent, the broker said.  ● Canaccord Genuity upgraded Hurricane Energy from “speculative buy” to “buy” with a 95p target price in response to recent first-half results from the North Sea oil explorer. An operational update on Hurricane’s Lancaster prospect in the West of Shetland improved confidence both in the reservoir quality and the project work, it said. “The Lancaster early production system has been on stream for only three months or so, and unsurprisingly it has not all been straightforward operationally. That seems likely to continue through the full commissioning process and the expansion programme ahead. Yet underlying that the company’s confidence in the Lancaster EPS is strengthening and we think that is increasingly justified in terms of both the subsurface and facilities.“There is still plenty of data to be gathered to embed the sense of reducing risk, and with another update expected before the year end 2019 and a capital markets day in the first quarter of 2020 there will be plenty of information to assess. We note that the current market capitalisation discounts little more than a risked view of the planned expanded Lancaster EPS, largely ignoring the undeveloped resource potential.”Canaccord ● Deutsche Bank upgraded J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison from “hold” to “buy” as part of a European grocery sector review. Having underperformed the wider market this year on fears about Brexit effects, food retailers are trading on average 19 per cent below their five-year historical relative valuation, Deutsche said.  “While we agree there will be some short-term disruptions in case of a no-deal Brexit, we also see room for retailers to mitigate it in the mid term through supply chain adjustments. Also, and as the risks of a recession in the UK increase, we believe the sector’s defensive nature should enable it to outperform, similar to the 2008-2009 period. As a result, we expect the share price pressure to ease gradually.”Deutsche Morrison has “the most defensive positioning, with less exposure to non food and a more locally sourced supply chain, on top of a strong balance sheet”, said Deutsche.  Sainsbury’s was entering a recovery phase with more aggressive pricing and promotions expected to drive improved sales growth in coming quarters, said the broker. It also kept “buy” advice on Tesco, saying earnings growth should outpace European peers as margins still had plenty of scope to improve.  As part of the same research, Deutsche downgraded Metro AG from “hold” to “sell” in the wake of last month’s failure by Czech and Slovak investors to take the German group private. “We believe the likelihood of a bid on Casino remains limited at this stage and see divestment potentially leading to higher rents and/or lower purchasing power,” it said.  ● In brief: Aena cut to “equal weight” at Barclays; Elisa cut to “sell” at Citigroup; Gusbourne rated new “buy” at Canaccord; Petra Diamonds raised to “hold” at Berenberg; Prosus rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; SEB cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Sanofi raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Swedbank raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Telefónica Deutschland raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Telenor cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays.

"Righteous anger from the US will not win the tech war with China","Washington’s tech sanctions will not halt Beijing’s industrial advance ","© Ingram Pinn/Financial Times Political debate is often couched in terms of principle. But the strongest argument against the US fighting a technology war with China has little to do with right and wrong. It is simply that the US may well lose.  Washington, to be sure, has cause to feel aggrieved. It has signed several bilateral agreements with Beijing since the early 1990s to protect American intellectual property in China, only for each one to be violated in spectacular fashion by Chinese actors.  For decades, Chinese shopping malls did a roaring trade in fake Nike shoes, counterfeit Apple iPhones and other ripped-off US brands, while commercial and trade secrets were also stolen. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimated that in 2015 alone, US losses were worth up to $540bn — more than the entire US trade deficit with China.  But righteous indignation is not, by itself, a winning strategy. US President Donald Trump boasted this month that “the longer the trade war goes on, the weaker China gets and the stronger we get”. But others see the opposite dynamic in play: mounting losses for leading American corporations as the US and Chinese economies decouple after nearly 40 years of engagement. The tech sanctions the US has imposed on China — restrictions on US exports to more than 140 Chinese companies on Washington’s “entity list” — were framed as punishment for wrongdoing. Beijing sees them as aggression born of fear that China will become the world’s technological leader.  Why the US has a lot to lose in a tech war with China A patriotic backlash in China has already begun. Cisco, the US networking equipment maker, is sounding the alarm. Chief executive Chuck Robbins said this month that Chinese state-owned companies are shutting their doors in Cisco’s face. “We’re being uninvited to bid,” he said. “We are not even being allowed to participate anymore.” Qualcomm, a US chipmaker that gains 65 per cent of its revenues from China, faces similar headwinds. The company warned this month that revenues in the 2019 financial year will fall to a seven-year low, largely because of dwindling Chinese demand. Rival US chip companies Micron, Qorvo and Broadcom also derive about half of their global revenues from China. “We know that US technology is often the best and we really do want to use it,” a senior Chinese tech executive said privately. “But when the supply from the US is so unreliable and so political, we are forced to find alternatives.” These sentiments are reinforced by Chinese consumers. Huawei, the world’s largest telecoms equipment company, has seen its smartphone sales soar at home following Washington’s decision to blacklist the company in May. Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone sales in China have slumped. From a Chinese perspective, the US approach appears akin to the “ku rou ji”, or “bitter flesh strategy” — wounding yourself to gain advantage over an adversary. In Chinese folklore, such a desperate ruse works only if you end up inflicting greater injury on your rival.  So far, China is absorbing the pain. Its official figures show the trade surplus with the US has swollen this year in spite of tit-for-tat trade tariffs. Some US tech companies, including HP, Dell, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple, are considering shifting some production out of China. But neither this, nor the US blacklist has been able to arrest China’s tech advance. Indeed, in several key areas, Chinese companies are already ahead. High-speed rail, high-voltage transmission lines, renewables, new energy vehicles, digital payments and 5G telecoms are just some of the industries in which Chinese companies are widely regarded as leading their US counterparts. Opinions are divided on whether the US or China has the more vibrant start-up culture. A study by Chinese institutions in 2017 found that the country had 164 unicorns — or start-ups valued at more than $1bn — compared with 132 for the US. But Credit Suisse said in a March report that the US had 156 unicorns against China’s 93 — and China’s were of inferior quality. Almost all sources agree that China is catching up fast — even in foundational disciplines such as artificial intelligence. “Despite China’s bold AI initiative, the United States leads in absolute terms,” the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said this week. “This order could change in coming years as China appears to be making more rapid progress than either the United States or the European Union,” it added. With dominance at stake, neither side appears ready to cede an inch. Dan Wang, a Beijing-based analyst at Gavekal, a research company, says that more Chinese companies are likely to be blacklisted by the US. Further steps could include limits on the export of broad categories of US-made technologies, he added. Angry remarks by Mr Trump this week underline the risks of escalation. “Somebody had to take China on,” he said. “And it’s about time, whether it’s good for our country or bad for our country short-term.”  The problem for Washington is that such steps might indeed be bad for America — in the short term and in the longer term as well. US companies and their affiliates operating in China sell nine times more than their Chinese counterparts sell in the US, according to Gavekal. As the superpowers decouple, the US has more to lose.  james.kynge@ft.com","22.08.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Norsk Hydro, IQE, Siemens, Burberry, Moncler","Network International’s IPO brokers stay positive even after a 22% gain","Tuesday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Norsk Hydro jumped after Brazil’s federal court lifted production embargoes on its Alunorte alumina refinery. Facing criminal and civil lawsuits over alleged pollution following heavy rainfall in February 2018, the Norwegian group had been running Alunorte at half capacity for more than a year. “The positive decision for a lifted embargo on Alunorte production clearly overrides the weak aluminium market and should trigger a revaluation journey for the stock. The Alunorte situation has not only hindered a potential revaluation due to its increased downstream exposure, but it has also been very counterproductive for total efficiency and the NKr3bn Better [improvement] programme.”Kepler Cheuvreux ● Entertainment One led the FTSE 250 fallers after its full-year revenue missed expectations. The media group, best known for its Peppa Pig franchise, said sales were down 9 per cent to £941.2m due to a weak performance from its persistently underperforming film and TV production businesses. Cost cuts and growth from the children’s media arm meant profit margins were better than expected.  ● Chip materials maker IQE was under pressure following a profit warning from US sector peer Lumentum, which announced a halt to chip and component shipments to Huawei overnight. The Trump administration later announced a temporary easing of export restrictions, saying companies could continue doing business with the Chinese group for three months.  Canaccord estimated that Huawei accounted for about 10 per cent of IQE revenues via sales to US chipmakers Qorvo and Skyworks. Since Lumentum was using its own chip wafers for depth-sensing chips, its suspension of shipments should be “negligible” for IQE, the broker added. Sellside stories ● Credit Suisse upgraded Siemens to “outperform” from “neutral” with a €143 target. “We see the attractions of Siemens’ structurally simplified portfolio and commitment to improved cash generation outweighing near-term cyclical risks,” it said. Siemens’ decision to focus on automation and smart infrastructure should deliver “higher customer fragmentation, more sales through professional installers and lower-ticket item sales — characteristics of quality growth names in the sector”, said Credit Suisse. It welcomed management’s ambition, set out at a recent capital markets day, to make Siemens “an exciting company to work at but ‘boring in terms of reliability of numbers’”. The broker also estimated that Siemens was trading at a 2 per cent discount to its peer group based on earnings in 2020, when it forecast earnings momentum to inflect. ● Bernstein Research raised Burberry to “market perform” from “underperform”. The negative response to last week’s full-year update from the fashion label had left risk-reward more balanced, it said. Burberry’s revenue growth has the potential to improve in the coming quarters as the new collection from creative director Riccardo Tisci arrives in stores, given the group has already reported double-digit growth in new styles, Bernstein said. The broker also highlighted that 80 stores representing about half of group sales were being refurbished over the next few quarters. And while wholesale revenue was likely to worsen following a “drastic distribution rationalisation” in the US, better like-for-like retail sales have the potential to support the price, it said. “Self-help stories like Burberry continue to be exposed to a yo-yo risk, as they rise on investors’ wanting to believe and fall on less-than-exciting updates. Therefore we see value in being realistic, tactical and open-minded. We keep our eyes open and ears on the ground to confirm brand momentum down the road, and act accordingly.”Bernstein ● Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Barclays started coverage of Network International with buy ratings, while Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan put neutral recommendations on the stock. All five brokers were involved in the Dubai-based digital payments group London flotation last month at 435p a share, subsequent to which the stock has surged 22 per cent.  “Network International provides an opportunity to gain access to the nascent payment markets across the Middle East and Africa without the foreign exchange risk, as greater than 96 per cent is US dollar pegged. It is the only vendor at scale with exposure across the value chain and its business is almost equally divided between acquiring and issuing solutions . . . Rising living standards, financial inclusion, upgrading infrastructure, government initiatives and high phone penetration are all factors driving rapid payment expansion with high-teens market growth over the coming years.”Barclays The shift from cash to digital payment is in its infancy in the Middle East and Africa, with 86 per cent of the volume conducted in cash compared with 60 per cent in Europe, said Barclays. The growth available justified a 585p target, equivalent to 36 times 2020 earnings, it said. Citigroup set a 665p target, which was based on the company delivering 5.9 per cent long-term earnings-per-share growth. Higher revenue growth, lower taxes and the scarcity value of the investment justified a premium to payments sector, particularly as few of its peers offer a comparable merchant versus issuer business mix, it said. While Goldman Sachs put a 650p valuation on the stock, Morgan Stanley went for a 555p target. A 5 per cent premium to sector peer Worldline was “appropriate given our forecast for higher revenue growth and profitability”, Morgan Stanley said. “Network International is the only scale, pan-regional player in the Middle East and Africa, one of the most underpenetrated payments regions globally. However, trading at circa 26 times 2020 adjusted free cash flow to the firm, we see much of the structural growth opportunity as priced in.”Morgan Stanley ● In brief: JCDecaux cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Moncler rated new “outperform” at Macquarie; Norsk Hydro upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Ryanair cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Vicat rated new “neutral” at Citigroup; WDP rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Wendel cut to “hold” at HSBC; XP Power downgraded to “hold” at Stifel.

"Best of Lex: your weekly round-up","US tech IPOs, Tesla, Chinese electric vehicles, Amazon, supermarkets and more","Dear readers, The universe is expanding faster than we thought. The mystery around cosmic forces is deepening. But it is the stock universe rather than the stellar one where Lex boldly goes. The great unknown here is how much profits businesses should forgo in search of bigger sales. How long should investors in Mission Control support pioneers voyaging towards potentially vast new markets? The market’s enthusiasm for lossmaking tech businesses, like the universe, seems both infinite and constantly expanding. The fleet of unicorns is multiplying. There are more than 300 US start-ups worth more than $1bn, three times as many as five years ago. Their lack of profits is unlikely to slow them down, Lex believes. On average, stock prices for the handful of profitable companies to list since 2010 have jumped 50 per cent. Prices for unprofitable companies are up 120 per cent.  Tesla should take advantage of this credulity while it lasts. This week, boss Elon Musk — himself a confirmed space cadet — talked about the merits of being on a Spartan diet, rather than going to Wall Street for the funds needed to ramp up investment. Time for Mr Musk to swallow his pride, said Lex. We also noted that China’s BYD sold more vehicles than Tesla last year. In the longer run, China’s growing middle class will constitute a huge market for electric vehicles, where established local producers will be favoured. The shares of BYD and BAIC trade at fractions of the rating boasted by Tesla. They look decent value, Lex thought. No company has illustrated the merits of sacrificing profits in favour of long-term growth better than Amazon. Income is now growing fast. It doubled in the first quarter this year. But the ability of Jeff Bezos, another tech rocket man, to keep reporting accelerating profit growth is in doubt if the company opts to funnel more money back into its business. Amazon may have no choice but to invest in faster deliveries. The rest of the online retail world is catching on to the benefits of offering fast delivery of goods. If Amazon wants to keep its lead, it has to go one better.  In some areas of retail, bricks-and-mortar retailers seem to be holding their own. The impact of ecommerce on the European groceries sector, for instance, has been less dramatic than some expected. That has encouraged investors to step back into the sector, buying Casino and Sainsbury’s stores this week. Grocers were also in the news this week when far more shoppers refused to cross picket lines of New England chain Stop & Shop than Dutch owner Ahold Delhaize could have envisaged. The company has been forced to axe plans to trim staff benefits. The cost of the strike — registered in unsold Easter and Passover food — is five times early estimates. The question of whether revenue should be favoured over profits is also being asked in mature consumer companies. The dangers of inadequate investment in growing categories have been illustrated by US food group Kraft Heinz, which announced a new boss — longtime AB InBev executive Miguel Patricio — on Monday. But an obsession with top-line increases, particularly from innovative products, carries risks too. Shares in consumer goods company Procter & Gamble dropped 3 per cent on Tuesday after the company’s profits did not keep up with revenue growth.  It is particularly difficult to make profits in Europe’s overcrowded banking industry. The pitiful returns result in frequent calls for consolidation among the region’s 6,000 banks. The collapse of the merger talks of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank merely delays the inevitable, Lex argued.  Credit Suisse provided some cheer. Its first-quarter results were better than those of some US rivals. A vindication of Tidjane Thiam’s refusal to cut deeper into the cost base of the investment bank? Too early to declare victory on that one, said Lex. Lex recommended that investors should vote against activist Edward Bramson getting a seat on the board of Barclays in a vote next week. Well, most of them should vote against him, we reckoned. A minority report in his favour would keep up pressure on chief executive Jes Staley to justify his enthusiasm for Barclays’ capital-hogging investment bank. He has a maverick’s chance of withstanding US competition and producing better results. There is a phrase for an endeavour where the glory brought by success is as great as the odds are slim. It is a “moonshot”. Live long and prosper. Vanessa Houlder Lex writer

"Deutsche Bank seeks to muscle in on wealth management boom","Fabrizio Campelli says division is hiring hundreds of people as it seeks to add assets","Deutsche Bank is planning to hire hundreds of staff and add almost €100bn of assets at its wealth management unit in a bid to break into the top tier of those catering to the growing ranks of the world’s ultra-rich. The division, run by Fabrizio Campelli, has been placed at the centre of a new strategy unveiled in July by Christian Sewing, chief executive, to revive Germany’s biggest bank.  While Deutsche is slashing 18,000 jobs and stripping out €6bn of annual costs, mainly from the investment bank’s trading arm, Mr Campelli has been given firepower to invest and hire in order to achieve ambitious targets in an increasingly crowded sector. “We are well under way with the process of hiring 300 people by 2020, all revenue-generating, client-facing individuals, in addition to the 600 we already have,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Their role “will be to expand our footprint in certain geographies and clients, or conquer new markets”. That means targeting new family offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai and newly minted tech entrepreneurs on the US west coast. In June, Deutsche poached Michael Rogers, a prominent Merrill Lynch banker, to run its Los Angeles outpost and have recruited from the likes of DBS in China and Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. However, Deutsche has a long way to go compete with the industry’s dominant players. With €213bn of assets under management — €28bn in the Americas, €122bn in Europe and only €64bn in lucrative, fast-growing emerging markets — it is not even a tenth of the size of global leader UBS, which has €2.3tn of invested AUM. Credit Suisse has €1.4tn. Wealth management must have the aim of generating a substantially more attractive return than the average for banking servicesFabrizio Campelli Mr Campelli also aims to increase client assets under management and custody by roughly a third over the next four years. That measure stood at about €283bn at the end of last year, meaning Deutsche wants to bring in more than €85bn by 2025. “Wealth management, as a whole, is obviously an attractive segment for all banks by nature of the business, the [low] capital consumption, [high] return on equity and growth rates,” he said. “So competing harder for the same clients has become a bit of a theme in this business.” The stakes are high for the wider bank. It is counting on boosting its share of revenues from more stable sources such as wealth management to 65 per cent by 2021. “Wealth management must have the aim of generating a substantially more attractive return than the average for banking services . . . [because] it does not consume a lot of capital, generates a lot of fees and is not as dependent on interest rates,” said Mr Campelli. Mr Campelli, an MIT-educated Italian and former McKinsey consultant, lives in London and regularly commutes to Zurich, where he is also head of Deutsche’s Swiss operation. He joined in 2005 and was head of group strategy under former chief executive Anshu Jain. Revenues at Deutsche fell 4 per cent to €856m in the first half of this year after dropping 16 per cent to €1.7bn in 2018, which it blames on the legacy of the break-up of the Sal Oppenheim private banking franchise. In the six months to June, the bank added €14bn in AUM, but still manages less than it did at the same point in 2018. So how is the ailing bank going to reverse the slide? “It is really important to have scale to make the business sustainably strong, but growth within [certain] segments is really what matters . . . we are not creating scale for the sake of scale,” said Mr Campelli. While in absolute terms growth has been smaller than its larger rivals, Deutsche’s 2 per cent increase in net new assets so far this year is in line with or better than most peers, he said. Deutsche believes it can use its large fixed-income trading and capital markets operations to lure clients from smaller, pure-wealth rivals such as Switzerland’s Julius Baer and Pictet. Mr Campelli says that in historically volatile markets one of his most popular products is risk-return engineering, whereby clients pay less than half a percentage point to protect a multi-asset portfolio from the first 5 per cent or so of losses for up to a year. “The luxury that nobody has when the market moves very quickly is time . . . products like this effectively buy you a bit of space . . . a bit of detachment from immediate events when everyone else is panicking,” he said. Clients can then decide “whether to exit from the investment and therefore crystallise any losses, or wait to see if there is a rebound”. Deutsche does not just offer this to its own clients, but will also insure portfolios held at rivals.  Another in-demand service is structured lending to the ultra-wealthy, offering them leverage off the back of their existing portfolios to take advantage of increasing asset values in a negative rate environment. “There is no safe repository of cash these days, it will erode in value, whether it’s from inflation or in negative interest rates,” said Mr Campelli. “The dialogue we have with them is focusing on cash alternatives, structured deposits, or money market funds.” Deutsche is considering whether to start charging wealthy clients for deposits in euros, as most rivals already have. Deutsche’s recent decision to close its equities sales and trading business will curtail the wealth management unit’s capacity to arrange exotic products such as collar loans or total return swaps for wealthy clients, because they rely on deep pools of equity on the balance sheet to be economical to sell. However, many analysts have questioned how effective an ECM unit can be without trading operations to back it up. Late last year Deutsche’s headquarters was raided by police looking for evidence of suspected money laundering, specifically linked to a British Virgin Islands subsidiary of the wealth management division, which has since been sold. Mr Campelli said he was confident enhanced compliance and know-your-client procedures will help his division avoid scandals that have plagued the bank in recent years, damaging its reputation and attracting billions in fines. Since 2015, the bank has cut a quarter of its 16,000 offshore clients in a review of their tax obligations in recent years. “We do not want to take undue risks by skirting too close to rules,” he said. “We’d rather keep a very large margin in the way we set up our non-financial risk policies . . . from operational losses to ones relating to anti-money laundering, anti-financial crime tax risk and so on.” This article has been amended to clarify the amount that customers have to pay to protect their portfolios from losses.

"The London Report: AstraZeneca leads FTSE fallers after share issue","Analysts claim drugmaker lacks ‘strategic flexibility’ following the raising of $3.5bn","Man Group rose on the back of “outperform” advice from Credit Suisse. It saw Man’s quantitative trading funds providing “better net new money generation, better relative performance across market conditions and better defence against margin competition than traditional asset managers”.  A UBS upgrade helped lift sector peer Jupiter Fund Management. Flows into Jupiter’s Dynamic Bond fund have improved sharply over the past six months, the broker noted.  UK miners jumped in tandem with iron ore prices as damage from a cyclone in Western Australia forced Rio Tinto to issue force majeure notices to some customers. Antofagasta led the blue-chip gainers, also helped by weak production figures from fellow Chilean copper miner Codelco. AstraZeneca was the FTSE 100’s sharpest faller after the drugmaker launched a share issue to raise $3.5bn, in tandem with a licence deal for a cancer treatment at an upfront cost of $1.35bn. New Street Research said the cash call highlighted AstraZeneca’s “lack of strategic flexibility caused by years of financial engineering”. Tui dropped after warning that costs related to the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max fleet would be much higher than investors expected. The travel company’s guidance suggested that if flights resume by mid-July, the hit to full-year earnings would be 17 per cent. ","29.03.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Plus500, Michelin, Omnicom, Coty, Spire, Britvic","European miners still look good value, says Goldman Sachs","Tuesday 13:30 GMT What’s happening ● Plus500 slumped on a profit warning, which was due to its clients not losing enough. The contracts-for-difference bookmaker said the effect of European leverage regulations in combination with maintained marketing spend was “likely to result in 2019 profit being materially lower than current market expectations”. Full-year results from Plus500 showed revenue up 65 per cent to $720m on a 20 per cent higher cost base, resulting in profit nearly doubling to $503m. But analysts highlighted that the average user acquisition cost rose more than 400 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter to $1,489 each. “The reason for the warning is that Plus500 considers its revenue run-rate to be currently around $100m, having disclosed that revenue from client losses in the fourth quarter was $56m and was achieved primarily given the bearish — but volatile — market, where clients are generally long. This has never been disclosed and to some extent makes more visible the inherent uncertainty in forecasting.”Peel Hunt ● Michelin led the Stoxx 600 gainers after its fourth-quarter results beat consensus forecasts, which had been lowered in response to a third-quarter profit warning. The tyremaker’s US volumes and pricing were ahead of forecast, while 2019 guidance for demand and raw materials costs was as expected.  “Michelin is able to sustain premium price points, while concurrently gaining market share — this is the perfect recipe for earnings growth . . . Given the combination of a lowly valuation and robust earnings outlook, we expect the company will relaunch its share-buyback at the upcoming capital markets day.”Citigroup ● 
Coty, which was last year’s worst performing S&P 500 member, surged after JAB Holdings, which owns a 39 per cent stake in the cosmetics maker, launched a tender offer to increase its shareholding to up to 59 per cent.  ● Omnicom gained after the US advertising agency reported its best US organic growth in the past 10 quarters. Group fourth-quarter earnings per share were $1.77 compared with a $1.66 consensus, though the beat was powered largely by non-operating items such as interest, tax and investment income.  Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs upgraded Rio Tinto to “buy” and cut BHP to “neutral” in a mining sector review.  The outlook for mining equities remains positive in spite of lowered expectations for global demand growth as there remains a lack of meaningful supply growth, either now or in the medium term, said Goldman. The big-four European miners are generating significant free cash flow and have few capital expenditure commitments, suggesting the majority will be returned to shareholders, it said. Goldman’s advised switching from BHP to Rio was on the back of the disaster at Vale’s iron ore dam in Brazil, and the uncertainty it creates in the market. Rio will be looked upon more favourably by investors as iron ore will provide more than 70 per cent of its 2019 operating earnings, said the broker.  As part of the same research, Goldman downgraded First Quantum to “neutral” on valuation grounds. Anglo American was its top pick in the sector as it “is one of only a few high-quality companies for which we expect positive earnings momentum this year, benefiting from the return of Minas Rio to operation”. ● Credit Suisse downgraded Spire Healthcare, the UK private hospital operator, to “underperform” from “neutral” with an 85p target price. It predicted that Spire would this month scrap its 2022 target of £200m in operating earnings.  “We expect UK hospital market conditions to worsen in 2019 and temper Spire’s nascent progress in private pay growth. Further, soft NHS revenues should impair fixed-cost absorption. The structurally lower profitability prompts us to cut the market value of Spire’s property from £1bn to £500m.”Credit Suisse Credit Suisse said that deteriorating profitability affected the likelihood of another bid from Mediclinic, Spire’s biggest shareholder, which made a 315p-a-share takeover offer in October 2017. Mediclinic said in June that its long-term intention was to fully own Spire or to fully sell down its stake. That outcome looks “closely linked to its ability to shore up its margins under current management”, said Credit Suisse. ● In brief: BE Semiconductor cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Bankia downgraded to “underperform” at Jefferies; Borregaard rated new “buy” at Berenberg; British Land rated new “sector perform” at RBC; Britvic cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Derwent London rated new “underperform” at RBC; GB Group upgraded to “buy” at Stifel; GEA downgraded to “sector perform” at RBC; Galp raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Hammerson rated new “sector perform” at RBC; Land Securities rated new “outperform” at RBC; Polymetal upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Telenor upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Tritax Big Box rated new “outperform” at RBC; Unipol raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs: the kingpins of tech IPOs","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One scoop confirmed to start: Brazil’s Natura, owner of the Body Shop and Aesop, has said it’s adding another company to its beauty bag, confirming a story by DD’s James Fontanella-Khan that it will acquire Avon Products in an all-stock deal. Now, on to the show . . .
 Game of Thrones, the HBO show, ended last week with the naming of an unexpected new king. Few on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley believe the battle between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will shake out the same way in one category. The two have a vice-like grip on advising top technology companies on their initial public offerings. And alongside JPMorgan Chase, the three commanded more than half of the fees generated by said listings last year. The next three banks — Bank of America, Allen & Co and Citigroup — earned less than a third of their bounty, according to data provider Refinitiv.  It makes the case of Uber and Lyft’s weak IPOs all the more noteworthy. Rivals are salivating over the opportunity to claw some market share back from the three top underwriters. And as DD readers already know, advisers will use any shred of evidence to try to win business from a rival. Our favourite titbit: Goldman used Facebook’s initial stumbles out of the gate (an IPO led by Morgan Stanley) in its pitch to woo Uber executives. It didn’t win Goldman lead left position on the Uber IPO, but they did come second. “The quality of deal execution is being called into question more, by both corporates and VCs [venture capital firms],” said David Hermer, head of equity capital markets at Credit Suisse, noting that a “small number of banks have a disproportionate share of leadership roles in technology IPO”. While rivals like Credit Suisse see the share price falls for Lyft and Uber as an opportunity to pitch unicorns like Airbnb and WeWork that are considering flotations, history suggests they face an uphill battle.  Credit Suisse, Bank of America, Citigroup, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are pitted against some of the most well-connected bankers in Silicon Valley. Howard Lerman, the chief executive of enterprise software company Yext, said the early drop in Uber, like Facebook before it, was unlikely to shake up the league tables. “When you’re a tech entrepreneur and you’re taking your company public, introducing new risk into the equation is not something you’re jumping to do,” he said. “By going with a tried and true [adviser], you’re not going to do something crazy.” Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan benefited as some rivals retrenched after the financial crisis; they also capitalised on demand for additional services from tech companies who were staying private for longer. Private placements were particularly popular, such as the 2015 $1.6bn private placement that Goldman led for Uber. It was a deal that was backed by Goldman’s own private wealth clients.  Dan Dees, co-head of Goldman’s investment banking division, told DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Laura Noonan, Shannon Bond and Nicole Bullock, that the bank has been a long-term player in the industry. “We’ve committed resource. We’ve kept our people here. We’ve maintained the commitment to the business through the lean times.” Goldman’s bankers, like Morgan Stanley’s, were roaming Silicon Valley in the 1990s when the tech underwriting business was most associated with the “Four Horsemen” — boutique investment banks Alex Brown, Hambrecht & Quist, Robertson Stephens and Montgomery Securities — which have long since been taken over by bigger institutions. Morgan Stanley alumni from that time include the noted venture capitalist Mary Meeker. The only bank to really muscle in to the duopoly is JPMorgan. Its push has been partly fuelled by its ability to lend, using the biggest bank balance sheet in the US, and the provision of other services such as cash management and private banking. JPMorgan led the Lyft IPO, but questions persist over whether even it can win lead left mandates when it goes to bake-offs against Morgan and Goldman. DD will avoid spoilers for readers who haven’t caught up on the finale of Game of Thrones. But we would caution, as far as Silicon Valley IPOs are concerned, it doesn’t look like either Goldman or Morgan are under siege. Things Fall Apart: Britain, British Steel and Greybull Capital On Tuesday, it was Jamie Oliver’s restaurant empire. On Wednesday, it was British Steel. The carnage in British business keeps coming with each passing day. On Wednesday, DD’s Javier Espinoza told you about a contrarian private equity investor who thinks he can snap up bargains once Brexit and other factors rip apart the already sluggish UK economy. But there’s nothing contrarian about the investment philosophy of Greybull Capital, the private equity outfit that bailed out British Steel three years ago. The distressed private equity fund scooped up the troubled company for a token £1 in 2016, allowing the UK’s Tory party, then led by David Cameron, the ability to escape an embarrassing business failure that would eliminate manufacturing jobs. Now Greybull blames the company’s demise on a well-known Cameron faux pas — Brexit. “There are a number of reasons why the turnaround has been very badly blown off course but the main one is Brexit,” Marc Meyohas, right, Greybull’s founder, told DD in his first interview since the company’s collapse.  However, those who follow Greybull closely already knew their investment was no sign of a revival for British Steel and its 5,000 employees. It was just a delay to their ultimate demise, which was formalised on Wednesday. The London-based private investment firm doesn’t exactly have a sterling reputation when it comes to saving damsels in distress. Greybull was the owner of Monarch airlines when it went bust in 2017, landing the not-so coveted title of the UK’s biggest peacetime repatriation after taxpayers paid a cool £60m to arrange the return of thousands of holidaymakers. Its foray into retail didn’t work out too well either, with both the electrical retailer Comet and convenience store chain My Local ultimately failing. But it seems to be a game of heads I win, tails you lose with Greybull, which sets up structures to minimise its loses in the event of a collapse, giving it minimum exposure to downside risks but benefits from a potential upside. Meyohas insisted he’d do it all over again, even risking failure. “Turnaround investing is an incredibly important part of the economy,” he said. “Companies get into trouble and it is right that there are people who are willing to support them.” “We cannot let these companies die. It would be crazy for the economy.” Read the full interview here. A juicy rumour that Apple tried to buy Tesla re-emerges It seems almost inevitable. As soon as Tesla’s stock price neared the $200 mark, rumours of a bid by Apple for the business started to resurface. The culprit? Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, floated the idea that Apple might want to buy Tesla based on market speculation that it had bid $240 per share for the electric carmaker in 2013. Whispers of takeovers aren’t unusual when a hot tech stock’s price falls. Snapchat’s share price collapse following its 2017 listing was peppered with murmings of a buyout. And a $240 per share price doesn’t seem too egregious for Apple, which has a comfortable cash stash and has dabbled in various car-related products. Does it?  Alphaville’s Jamie Powell takes a look at the numbers to see how Tesla’s shareholders would fare in such a deal. After all, the company’s balance sheet looks vastly different to how it did six years ago. The full details are here, but put simply, due to Tesla’s share count increasing by almost half and it’s net debt going up, Apple’s hypothetical offer would convert to only $115 per share. A 44 per cent discount doesn’t sound too good, at least until shareholders hear that Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, once firmly in the Tesla bull camp, says the shares could fall to a mere $10 in a worst-case scenario. According to Business Insider, Jonas told clients on Wednesday that Elon Musk’s company is no longer a growth story but “a distressed-credit story”. Ouch.

"India’s supreme court strikes down central bank’s corporate default rules","Shares in indebted companies rally after directive is deemed unconstitutional","India’s supreme court has struck down tough central bank rules on corporate defaults that had been designed to address the banking industry’s chronic bad loan problem. The Reserve Bank of India issued a directive in February last year ordering banks to declare a default on the first day of delayed loan repayments from large corporate clients. If the situation was not resolved within 180 days, the RBI said, banks should launch bankruptcy proceedings under the country’s insolvency code.  The directive came after banks proved slow to take action under the code, which became law in 2016 and mandates liquidation of insolvent companies after nine months if no buyer is found. On Tuesday, however, the supreme court ruled that the RBI had gone beyond its mandate. The law governing the central bank, it said, allowed it to issue directions about resolving individual defaults — but not to set down a sweeping rule of the kind imposed last year. By imposing a time limit, the now obsolete directive had brought the swift resolution of corporate defaults, said Abizer Diwanji, financial services head for EY in India. He pointed to the case of Jet Airways, in which creditors last week agreed to a plan to take a majority stake in the company. “Some of that decision-making momentum will now slow down,” he said. The central bank has been engaged in a long-running campaign to reduce the burden of bad corporate debt on Indian banks, which was amassed through lending to ill-fated projects in infrastructure and industries including steel. At the end of December, Indian banks had an aggregate bad loan ratio of 10.4 per cent, according to Credit Suisse. The problem has sparked fears about the ability of banks to expand lending in one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies. While the 2016 bankruptcy code greatly increases lenders’ rights at the expense of powerful business owners, banks have been slow to make use of it, preferring to delay action rather than trigger hefty writedowns under an insolvency process. Last February’s central bank directive sent a powerful message to industrialists who had once expected to keep control of their companies while pushing losses on to creditors, said Ashish Gupta, head of India equity research at Credit Suisse. But the new rules were challenged in court by companies and lobby groups from industries including power and shipbuilding. The power companies argued that the directive was arbitrary and took no account of the specific challenges of their sector, including the difficulty of securing payment from cash-strapped state electricity distributors. Share prices of several heavily indebted power companies rose after the court ruling, with RattanIndia Power gaining 10.9 per cent and Adani Power 3.2 per cent. Amit Tandon, co-founder of Mumbai-based Institutional Investor Advisory Services, said that while some would see the court’s ruling as a “setback” in the drive to stabilise the banking sector, there had been valid concerns about the RBI’s directive. “I’m not sure this 180-day limit works — it’s too short a window,” he said. The RBI ruling was made under former governor Urjit Patel, who has since been replaced by former finance ministry official Shaktikanta Das, after well-publicised tensions with the government over issues including RBI restrictions on the state banks worst hit by bad loans. But the central bank under Mr Das is still likely to respond to Tuesday’s ruling by imposing a redrafted set of rules aimed at keeping the pressure on banks to resolve corporate defaults, Mr Diwanji said. Tougher provisioning requirements for overdue loans was one option, he added. “We should expect the RBI to come up with something else,” he said.","02.04.2019"
"Stars fail to align to bring LSE into Hong Kong orbit","Decision to abandon London bid leaves HKEX looking elsewhere for growth","As Charles Li abandoned his £32bn pursuit of the London Stock Exchange, he admitted to not having a crystal ball. Few believed he needed one to know that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing’s bid for the LSE had looked ill-fated from the start. A successful takeover typically needs several stars to align, but when HKEX, which Mr Li has run for almost a decade, launched its bid for the LSE a month ago the backdrop could hardly have been more fraught. LSE shareholders were still applauding David Schwimmer, the group’s chief executive, who just weeks earlier had sealed a $27bn deal for Refinitiv, the data company best known for the Eikon desktop terminals. At the same time, fears that Beijing was threatening Hong Kong’s independence had triggered mass street protests and clouded the future of the former British colony. HKEX’s decision to walk away draws a line under a month-long drama that saw some of the world’s biggest banks and M&A boutiques lock horns. It also leaves HKEX facing the challenge of cutting its dependence on a domestic IPO market that is struggling, while also adding to the pressure on Mr Schwimmer to make his signature Refinitiv deal work. “The proposal had not been thought through carefully,” said Christopher Cheung, a legislative councillor for the financial services sector in Hong Kong and HKEX shareholder. “Therefore this was an acquisition with a lot of uncertainties. Withdrawing now, of course, is the best option. The shareholders of HKEX weren’t consulted, and a lot of them actually objected.” Adding more cash to the offer is like putting on a nicer colour shirt — it’s not going to do enough to change shareholders’ viewsTop 20 LSE shareholder Shares in HKEX closed more than 2 per cent higher on Tuesday, as the Asian bourse’s investors welcomed the abandonment of an ambition that Mr Li and HKEX chairwoman Laura Cha had nurtured for 12 months. The decision was taken at a board meeting held on Monday at HKEX’s Exchange Square headquarters, close to the site of mass protests that have swept the territory for months. After a robust debate, the board decided “it was difficult to put shareholders’ money on the line when we were flying blind”, one person familiar with the matter said. Another person familiar with the board meeting said that “London clearly did not wish to engage,” referring to the LSE’s management. “We would have had to go hostile and we didn’t want that.” Mr Schwimmer first learnt of HKEX’s interest when Mr Li and his advisers, led by the US boutique adviser Moelis, asked for a meeting in early September at the LSE’s headquarters in the shadow of St Paul’s cathedral. After receiving a cool reception from the LSE’s management, HKEX stunned the City by going public with its proposal two days later on September 11. Within 48 hours, the LSE had issued a forthright rejection.  The withering dismissal by the LSE embarrassed Mr Li, two people with knowledge of the matter said, but the Hong Kong exchange quickly embarked on a three-week tour of LSE shareholders to sell the merits of its vision — and also pose questions over the Refinitiv deal.  For HKEX, buying the LSE offered the chance to link the west to Chinese capital markets that Beijing is determined to open up. As the clock ticked towards the October 9 deadline by which it would have to make a formal bid or walk away, HKEX added HSBC, Credit Suisse and UBS — banks that could help it tap the debt markets if it were to sweeten its bid — to its group of advisers. The team at Moelis was led by Caroline Silver, who had previously advised IntercontinentalExchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, on its attempt to gatecrash a planned merger between the LSE and its German rival Deutsche Boerse in 2016. Advising HKEX also pitted Ms Silver against her former colleagues from US bank Morgan Stanley, who were working on the deal for LSE. So too were her ex-Morgan Stanley colleagues from boutique Robey Warshaw. By then the LSE had also enlisted JPMorgan, Mr Li’s former employer and a specialist in deals in market infrastructure.   HKEX said on Tuesday that LSE’s shareholders — in contrast to the exchange’s management — had engaged with them. But few were tempted by a bid that was also beset by political hurdles. Some believed that HKEX’s bid had little chance of regulatory approval, especially from a key US committee that monitors foreign investments that affect the country’s strategic interests. One of the LSE’s most coveted assets is LCH, the clearing house that is a linchpin of the global financial system because it is the world’s largest handler of US-dollar denominated swaps. “Adding more cash to the offer is like putting on a nicer colour shirt — it’s not going to do enough to change shareholders’ views,” one top 20 LSE shareholder told the FT. “The Refinitiv deal offers something very different to what LSE already has, while the HKEX deal would make it more volatile and cyclical.” According to three people familiar with the matter, HKEX drew up the plan to buy the LSE a year ago, but postponed making a move because of the uncertainty over Brexit. Its hand was then forced by the LSE’s swoop on Refinitiv. Yet launching the high-stakes bid against such a testing backdrop has raised speculation among market participants in Hong Kong that the move was encouraged by Beijing. HKEX has been at pains to stress that is not the case. “There are more questions than answers,” said one senior banker who has lived on both sides of the Pacific. “You would have thought such bright people would not have miscalculated and believed that they could do this deal in this environment.” The LSE’s management discovered the HKEX decision to give up as they read the news overnight. While the retreat was not a complete surprise, shares in the LSE fell almost 6 per cent on Tuesday. It had held no discussions with HKEX since its initial rejection. Indeed, Mr Schwimmer and Mr Li had hugged the opposite sides of a conference hall late last month when they both spoke in London. Mr Schwimmer, who has only led the LSE for just over a year, is now able to focus on executing the Refinitiv deal, which he claims will push the bourse, with its history stretching back more than 300 years, into the lucrative 21st century business of slicing and dicing market data.   In a brief statement on Tuesday, it said it had begun seeking regulatory approval from authorities around the world. It is due to publish a circular in coming weeks and expects to hold a shareholder meeting to vote on the deal in November. For Hong Kong, the failure threatens to turn 2019 into a poor year for the territory’s stock exchange. It was already lagging far behind New York. Mr Li was now eager to ensure Hong Kong did not suffer a double humiliation by losing its IPO crown to rival bourses in New York this year, one person with knowledge of the matter said. Recent weeks have seen a $5bn listing by AB InBev’s Asia business and a $1bn IPO from Chinese sportswear company Topsports. But funds raised on Hong Kong’s main board in 2019 are down 42 per cent from a year ago at $18bn, while listings on the Nasdaq are up about 19 per cent at almost $30bn, data from Dealogic show. “Dropping the deal cannot fully dismiss market worries over questions of prospects for HKEX’s China growth story,” said Yafei Tian, an analyst at Citigroup. Mr Li had described the potential marriage of HKEX and the LSE as “a corporate tale of Romeo and Juliet”. If he meant his ambitions would be dashed by a similarly star-crossed fate, he has been proved right.  Additional reporting by Daniel Shane in Hong Kong

"Nestlé confirms talks with EQT group to sell skincare unit for $10bn","Unit has been part of Nestlé since 2004 and generates $2.8bn in revenue","A consortium led by private equity group EQT and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is in exclusive talks buy Nestle’s skincare unit for SFr10.2bn ($10.1bn), according to a statement from the Swiss company on Thursday. The Financial Times first reported EQT had entered into talks with Nestlé on Wednesday in a fiercely competitive auction in what will be one of the largest transactions in Europe this year.The group of investors, which also includes Canada's PSP, will help the business grow further “by building on the company’s strong market position and brands”, the statement said.The unit, founded in 1981, has been part of Nestlé since 2004 and generates combined revenue of SFr2.8bn ($2.78bn), and employs more than 5,000 people.EQT said it would look to drive innovation, invest in research and development and expand its US presence.Michael Bauer, global head of healthcare at EQT, said: “The heritage of the company as a focused skincare company with a comprehensive product portfolio, exceptionally strong brands and high customer loyalty is unique. This growth investment opportunity fits well to EQT’s DNA of driving growth and making strong companies even stronger.”Hamad Shahwan Al Dhaheri, executive director of the private equities department at ADIA, said: “This proposed transaction aligns with our approach of making strategic investments alongside proven partners to help strong, innovative businesses grow.” The company will keep its headquarters in Switzerland and will be renamed Galderma, the statement said. Any potential deal is subject to employee consultations and customary regulatory approvals. David Hayes, an analyst at Société Générale, anlayst said the price tag for the unit was “what we would have expected for the asset”, and predicted Nestle would continue selling assets to streamline itself in the coming years, including by selling down its stake in L’Oreal. “The exit from Skin Health is another reason we also expect an announcement in the coming months of a gradual further exit of the 23pct stake in L’Oreal as well. We no longer see any strategic support for this interest from the relatively new Board and Management teams Rothschild & Co and PwC acted as financial advisers to the consortium of EQT, ADIA and PSP. Kirkland & Ellis International acted as legal adviser. Credit Suisse and Evercore advised Nestle on the sale.","16.05.2019"
"Best of Lex: your weekly round-up","Philip Morris/Altria, Purdue, Swatch/Richemont, Fanuc, Petrofac, UBS, Pets at Home and more","Dear readers,  Memories of cigarette smoke-filled rooms wafted through Lex’s mind this week. Not so long ago the whiff of tobacco pervaded journalists’ lives. Alongside booze, smokes loosened the tongues of contacts. Nowadays “smokers bond by huddling together against the cold and discussing how to quit”, Lex noted. The same applied to tobacco companies such as Philip Morris International and Altria, “corporate pariahs in a health-conscious world”. The companies’ planned $210bn merger dominated corporate news in a week overshadowed again by global politics: Hong Kong protesters’ stand-off with China, US president Donald Trump’s rants about the economy, and Brexit trauma in the UK. As they chronicle world events, media organisations such as the Financial Times are, thankfully, smoke-free. (Lex is powered by coffee, fruit and cake). The challenge for tobacco companies is to manage that long-term decline — and the rise of tobacco alternatives, such as vaping. The latter persuaded Philip Morris and Altria to recombine. “Pooling resources to develop and market new products makes sense,” Lex reckoned. Altria spun off its international wing — Philip Morris — more than a decade ago, when its shares traded at a discount to the sum of the parts. But the gambit failed to deliver expected gains to shareholders. While Philip Morris shareholders were sceptical. Lex was more positive. Its “risks and rewards are stacked more evenly than they are for smokers”.    More acute dangers face businesses caught up in the US opioid crisis. Privately held Purdue Pharma, which faces a blizzard of lawsuits, was in talks over a $10bn to $12bn settlement, it emerged this week. The shares of other companies fell. Lex argued that responsibility should be shared. Regulators approved the painkillers. Doctors wrote the prescriptions, egged on by insurers. But there were broader lessons for companies at a time when a debate is intensifying over their responsibilities beyond maximising shareholder value. Businesses “alleged contribution to the worst drugs crisis in American history increases pressure for companies to temper profit-seeking with social duty”.  Hong Kong political tensions turned uglier on Friday with the arrest of two leading activists. Lex this week made its call on local property markets. Historically, Hong Kong real estate has remained largely resilient through political unrest. “This time is different,” we wrote. Shares in Hong Kong property developers have fallen sharply. Office vacancy rates have risen, retail space has been hit as Chinese shoppers stay away and home sales have fallen. Hong Kong’s developers also rely on Beijing to support growth on the mainland. “They are walking a tightrope as relations worsen between the two,” noted Lex. The Hong Kong protests have led to share price falls for Swiss watchmakers Richemont and Swatch Group. They fell after previous unrest in 2014 but then recovered. Luxury goods sales will probably be displaced, rather than lost. A bigger question is whether demand for mechanical timepieces can withstand the trend towards Instagram-able “experiences”. Lex’s confidence that it could was reinforced by readers’ glowing comments on the craftsmanship they wore on their wrists. Lex also considered the woes of other mechanical creations — those toiling in manufacturing industries. “A global slowdown has left China with idle robots and underemployed factories,” we noted. Shares in Fanuc, the Japanese robot maker, have fallen 17 per cent in a year yet “plummeting orders still do not seem fully priced in”. Oil service companies arguably face greater structural threats. Lex noted how European companies — such as Petrofac, which serves big energy companies and this week gave a gloomy outlook — have decoupled from oil prices. “The world is increasingly embarrassed by its hydrocarbon riches,” we wrote. “Heroic roustabouts in Arctic parkas are out of fashion. Teenage climate activists are cool.” It has been a busy week for Swiss banks. UBS, the country’s biggest, hauled in Iqbal Khan to co-head its main global wealth management unit. UBS’s shares have underperformed those of other Swiss banks this year as it weathers tough market conditions. Mr Khan defected from rival Credit Suisse and is now a possible successor to Sergio Ermotti, UBS’s longest-serving chief executive since its creation via a 1998 merger. But Mr Ermotti has also promoted other possible successors, Lex noted. “Resulting internal strife could be creative — or destructive. Mr Ermotti’s job will only become harder if it is the latter.” Swiss financial supervisor Finma, meanwhile, granted the first banking licences to two crypto-finance start ups. Lex is sceptical about the value of cryptocurrencies, except to money launderers and other outlaws. Facebook’s plans for its Libra digital currency have frightened central banks and regulators. Nevertheless, crypto technology could cut costs and “democratise” finance, including by giving access to the unbanked. The financial system “will benefit from Swiss experimentation”, we reckoned. Every column needs a tailpiece. Lex purred when its note on the UK’s Pets at Home was among its best read this week. The company’s shares have doubled this year. Lex reckoned restructuring measures would be a collar on short-term profits but made it an attractive long-term proposition. “Dog-loving investors should consider throwing Pets at Home a bone,” we said. Time spent with animal friends is a healthier way to relax than smoking and drinking. Whatever your plans, Lex wishes you a restful weekend. Ralph Atkins Lex writer

"Fed meeting, Brexit, third-quarter earnings","Start every week on the front foot with a preview of what’s on the global agenda","Attention this week turns to the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce a further quarter percentage point rate cut on Wednesday, shortly after US growth data likely to show another quarterly slowdown are released. There are also central bank decisions in Japan, Canada, Brazil and Colombia. Brexit will continue to dominate UK politics, as the country waits to see how long an extension the EU will grant while Boris Johnson tries to force a general election. The Central Committee of China’s ruling Communist party begins a four-day meeting on Monday, amid speculation some of the younger generation of leaders may be promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee. Tech and media types can look forward to the launch of Apple’s TV streaming service on Friday, which rolls out in more than 100 countries and regions. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathers towards the end of the week for a summit in Bangkok, where leaders from China, India, Japan and South Korea are expected to speak over the course of the weekend. On Wednesday, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg testifies before Congress about the grounded 737 Max in the wake of two deadly crashes. Mr Muilenburg promised investors last week that Boeing had learnt the lessons of the crisis.  Back in the UK, the first phase of findings from the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people in June 2017, are due to be published on Wednesday.  There are also notable farewells this week — Mario Draghi hands over the presidency of the European Central Bank to Christine Lagarde, and both are due to speak at a farewell event in Frankfurt for Mr Draghi on Monday, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. John Bercow steps down as Speaker of Britain’s House of Commons on Thursday. He has been unusually interventionist in the role over the past decade and has become a well-known figure, especially since helping parliament to steer the course of Brexit. It’s also a busy time for earnings. In the UK financials HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds report, with the final cost of the payment protection insurance mis-selling very much on investors minds. Tech giants Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are among the many big names reporting in the US. There’s plenty for economy watchers to get their teeth into with this week’s run of US data, with updates on jobs, growth and the manufacturing sector. There are also gross domestic product figures due across Europe. Brexit Mr Johnson will dare MPs to vote on Monday for a pre-Christmas election on December 12, allowing him to bring his deal back to the Commons for scrutiny and give parliament until November 6 to approve the enabling legislation.  Under the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, Mr Johnson needs to obtain cross-party support and the backing of at least 434 MPs.  Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists have said that they will use their 10 Westminster votes to defeat the government.  The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to order his MPs to abstain and other opposition parties have also indicated they will vote against Monday’s motion.  A one-page bill drawn up by the Liberal Democrats for a December 9 election would only require the support of a simple majority of MPs in a vote on Tuesday. The Lib Dems and the Scottish National Party have argued the bill would prevent Mr Johnson rushing his deal through the Commons ahead of an election, as well as remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Central banks The Fed is widely expected to reduce its benchmark interest rate for the third consecutive time this year on Wednesday, leaving economists to ponder if that will be it for this year. The central bank has notched up 75 basis points of monetary stimulus this year — and to some economists and Fed officials that should be sufficient to accomplish the goal.  But a drumbeat of relatively soft economic data, and fears of a negative market reaction, could make Fed chair Jay Powell and other policymakers wary of indicating that this round of “insurance” cuts is already over. Most economists expect the Bank of Canada’s to keep rates on hold on Wednesday thanks to a resilient economy. However, some analysts forecast a quarter percentage point rate cut could be on the cards due more turbulent economic conditions ahead. Brazil is set to deliver a third straight 50 basis-point cut to its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, lowering borrowing costs to an all-time low of 5 per cent amid below-target inflation. On the same day Colombia’s central bank is forecast to hold interest rates at 4.25 per cent. On Thursday, many economists now expect the Bank of Japan to stay its hand, or else to make only a relatively minor adjustment to policy, despite hinting at its last meeting that it might take action this time around. Background reading Federal Reserve faces decision whether to signal pause to rate cuts

Markets Questions: Will the Fed signal a rate rise pause and will the BoJ ease?

 Earnings UK financials are in the spotlight again this week. HSBC reports on Monday, when updates on a huge cost-cutting drive that threatens up to 10,000 jobs are expected to be announced alongside the results.  Five months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong are also expected to start to bite, as they will at Standard Chartered which reports on Wednesday. Hong Kong is the single-biggest profit centre for the two banks. Hong Kong accounted for 52 per cent of HSBC’s profit before tax in the first half of this year, while it brought in a third of StanChart’s income in the same period, as per the banks’ financial filings. Lloyds reports on Thursday with profits expected to take another big hit after the lender last month conceded the cost of compensating customers for mis-sold payment protection insurance was much worse than anticipated, suspending the remainder of its annual share buyback programme. BP provides an update on Tuesday with Royal Dutch Shell following on Thursday, when investors will be on the lookout for any damage brought by falling oil prices. Telecoms group BT, British Airways parent IAG, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline and retailer Next also report this week. In the US, more than 160 companies on the S&P 500 are scheduled to report results. The list includes tech giants like Apple, Alphabet and Facebook but also a range of companies from consumer names, such as Kraft Heinz, to energy companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. In Europe, Airbus, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are among those reporting, with the German bank’s earnings expected to shed light on progress in its multibillion-euro restructuring. Samsung Electronics, the world’s top memory chipmaker, releases detailed figures for the third quarter, after projecting it had beaten profit expectations earlier this month amid signs of a chip cycle recovery. Economic data US gross domestic product figures on Wednesday are set to show the economy cooled sharply in the third quarter — growth of 1.6 per cent, down from 2 per cent in the second quarter, is forecast.  Friday’s jobs report is set to show hiring down to 90,000 in October, a fall from 136,000 the previous month, while the unemployment rate is expected to have edged higher to 3.6 per cent from 3.5 per cent. However, average hourly earnings are also expected to have climbed, rising 0.3 per cent month-on-month and 3 per cent from a year ago.  Economists warn the report could be “messy” as a result of the strike at General Motors and expect this to reverse in November’s report as the carmaker has cut a deal with the union.  Manufacturing data the same day are expected to show the sector contracted for the third consecutive month as uncertainty about the US-China trade war has weighed on global growth and complicated the outlook for American factories. Third-quarter GDP data are due from France, Italy, Spain, Austria and Belgium, alongside the first estimate for the eurozone, which is forecast to record just 0.1 per cent growth. ","27.10.2019"
"French insurance bust-up leads Scor to sue rival over ditched bid","Paris-based reinsurer threatens legal action against Covéa over its withdrawn offer","Paris-based reinsurer Scor is taking legal action against Covéa, as well as its rival’s chief executive and its advisers after the mutual insurer on Tuesday dropped controversial plans for a takeover. “Scor just learned with great surprise and astonishment that, during market operating hours, Covéa issued a press release stating that ‘a transaction with Scor is no longer part of its strategic options’,” Scor said in a statement. The reinsurer added that it would be bringing the matter to the attention of the French markets regulator, the AMF. Covéa, which is Scor’s largest shareholder with an 8 per cent stake, first made its takeover interest public in September but the move was forcefully rejected by Denis Kessler, the reinsurer’s long standing chief executive.  Scor said in a press release on Tuesday that it planned to launch legal action against Covéa and its chief executive, Thierry Derez, for alleged “breach of trust” and “concealment of breach of trust” respectively. Mr Derez was on the board of Scor until November last year.  Scor is also pursuing a complaint against Covéa’s advisers, Barclays and Rothschild. Covéa said it strongly denied all the allegations contained in Scor’s press release. “Covéa will hold a board meeting tomorrow and reserves all rights to protect its interests in view of these serious and unfounded accusations which are harmful to its reputation,” it added.  Credit Suisse had been advising Covéa earlier in the process, but Scor said that it was “informed by Credit Suisse in November 2018 of its decision, for reasons of compliance with the laws and regulations in force, to withdraw its support for any plans by Covéa to take control of Scor.” The insurer said it commended “this decision by Credit Suisse, which is to its credit”. Earlier in the day, Covéa said it had taken “note of Scor’s refusal to enter into any discussions in relation to Covéa’s proposed friendly transaction offer addressed on August 24, 2018. The continued attacks and hostile tactics targeting Covéa since then have intensified in the last few days.” “As a consequence, Covéa states that a transaction with Scor is no longer part of its strategic options,” added the French mutual insurer. Shares in Scor dropped as much as 13 per cent in response to the news, wiping almost €1bn off its market capitalisation and taking them back towards the level they were trading at the beginning of September. Scor said it strongly denied the claim by Covéa that there were “continued attacks and hostile tactics targeting Covéa”.  Covéa had said it would respect a standstill agreement not to take its stake above 10 per cent before April 2019 but had also said it regretted the “lack of discussion with Scor”. According to people familiar with the matter, the two sides have not discussed any potential deal in recent weeks and both CEOs remain at loggerheads.  Mr Kessler has previously ruled out a deal, saying that “there was absolutely no industrial project, no synergies”. Covéa announced its €43-a-share offer, which valued Scor at €8.2bn, in August. Covéa, Barclays and Rothschild declined to comment. ","29.01.2019"

"Stock and bond markets offer diverging view on US outlook","Expectations for tumult in fixed income jump while implied equity volatility subdued","The bond and equity markets are flashing different outlooks on the US economy. Expectations for turbulence in the fixed income market have risen to a more than two-year high, even as measures of volatility in US equities have largely maintained a sense of calm. A closely watched gauge of expected price swings in US Treasuries over the coming month, the Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate, has risen above 73, its highest level since April 2017. But the CBOE volatility index, or Vix, is still at around 18, close to its long-run average.   At the heart of the discrepancy lies a different assumption over the economic outlook.  Mandy Xu, a derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse, said equities are not fully pricing in downside risks but rather are treating tariffs “as a stock or sector-specific catalyst.”  The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tracks 30 companies that design, distribute, make and sell chips, fell 16 per cent in May, while an index tracking European carmakers fell 13 per cent. But moves in wider markets were more measured: the S&P 500 fell around 6 per cent.  “You see the large risk premiums being priced into sectors and stocks but not reflected in the broader indices. In contrast, the bond market is saying recession risks have risen significantly,” Ms Xu said.  Yields on government bonds have declined sharply as investors sought out the safety of sovereign debt.  “The US Treasury market is telling the Fed to cut rates now,” said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital.  This week the benchmark 10-year US note fell below 2.10 per cent for the first time since September 2017, while the yield on the more policy-sensitive two-year fell to an 18-month low. The global stock of negative-yielding debt has climbed above $11tn and reached its highest level since 2016, Barclays data show.  “US real yields have been declining and underscore the secular stagnation thesis of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. So all eyes on the next 19 June FOMC meeting where the Fed can catch up with the bond market,” said Mr MacKinnon.   The diverging expectations “won’t go unnoticed by investors who believe that fixed income markets are better at predicting economic outcomes than stocks,” Allianz’s chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian said this week.  Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, said the recent increase in trade tensions illustrates “the importance of holding a diversified portfolio, both across geographic regions and sectors, to mitigate idiosyncratic risks.” The group has reduced risk in its tactical asset allocation and recommends countercyclical positions to protect against downside risk.  Earlier this week Morgan Stanley, which is underweight in US equities and overweight in Treasuries and cash, warned the US market cycle has shifted to a “downturn” for the first time since 2007.

"The Heavens by Sandra Newman — time travel tears asunder","A woman who travels to the past in her sleep struggles with the  world in which she awakes","The Heavens advertises itself as a “high-concept” novel of the type publishers pin their budgets on — “a story of love complicated by time travel” — while employing high-literary endorsements on its cover to convince sophisticated readers that it is for them too. At “a rich girl’s party” in Manhattan Kate and Ben meet and fall in love. This is in a better world than ours, the summer of 2000 “when carbon emissions had radically declined and the Jerusalem peace accords had been signed and the UN surpassed its millennium goals for eradicating poverty”. But Kate has an unfortunate condition. When she goes to sleep she travels back in time to Elizabethan England, where she is Emilia Lanier, a mistress to powerful men, the dark lady of Shakespeare’s sonnets. Each time she wakes up in the present, the world has changed subtly for the worse, and she is the only one of her friends who remembers the better world. Kate’s friends become convinced of her escalating lunacy. She becomes convinced she has to save the world by interfering in the past, but she has no idea how to go about this. The “save the world” mission never finds a form, so generates little suspense, emblematic of the novel’s reluctance to decide on what it is basing its appeal. The time travelling is more effective as a device to dramatise schizophrenic delusion, by having the reader sympathise with someone who understands what no one else can see. The novel uses this device for Swiftian satire too: Kate as the ingénue who can’t understand the self-destructive logic of the society she encounters from a more enlightened perspective. Sandra Newman wants to skewer liberal contradictions: Ben the poet who ends up working for an oil company, Sabine the political activist who works for Credit Suisse, this elite who think they “are supposed to be the good guys” and never acknowledge their role in creating a divided society.  But it’s difficult to write an effective critique of middle-class complacency from so firmly within its point of view: the characters with inner lives are rich multiracial New Yorkers; in other places, such as West Virginia, “the people were white, xenophobic, open carry, evangelical”. And so the novel errs on the side of the romantic time-travel plot: Kate is one of a number of time travellers, along with Shakespeare and Alexander the Great. The increasing distance between her and Ben each time she wakes up is moving, though elsewhere the attempts at romance are saccharine: they make love in a library filled with “books that seemed to solemnly think their thousand stories in the gloom beyond the light of the reading lamp”. Adjectives and adverbs froth — “impossibly charming”, “gorgeously physical” — as the writing strains to animate two-dimensional characters. In the end, it’s hard to care for these mournful and blinkered liberals who the novel knows need criticising but adores too much to do so with feeling. The Heavens

"Equivalent of doping? Private equity takes juicing the numbers to the next level","Firms are giving themselves credit for cost-cutting even before they have bought the company","© Bloomberg Private equity firms have become notorious for juicing the numbers. It is rather less common for their senior partners to be bracingly honest about it. This year marks the 30th anniversary of Barbarians at the Gate — the seminal account of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom — and the private equity playbook remains essentially unchanged: pile debt on a company to fund its acquisition, strip out as many costs as possible, then flip the “improved” company to another buyer for a higher price. Today’s masters of the universe have taken this template one stage further, giving themselves credit for the cost-cutting before they even get their hands on the company.  Heavily adjusted earnings have become an inescapable fact of life in the modern buyout boom. Private equity firms now use eyebrow-raising “pro forma” earnings numbers, a useful bit of Latin allowing them to factor in cost savings before they are even made.  This has the helpful effect of bringing down a buyout’s leverage, the crucial measure of how much debt it has relative to its annual earnings.  Jonathan Lavine, co-managing partner at global private equity giant Bain Capital, recently took aim at these “increasingly aggressive” adjustments in a refreshingly honest interview with the Financial Times. He compared it to a 5ft 8in man telling people that he was “6ft 2in on a pro forma basis”. “I’m not actually 6ft 2in on a pro forma basis, but I can make adjustments like standing on a box, maybe trying to stretch,” Mr Lavine said. Another way to think about the practice: it is the financial equivalent of doping in sports. Private equity firms are artificially enhancing their company’s performance to get large deals over the line. And there is a common refrain that will be familiar to anyone who has read an interview with an athlete caught using performance-enhancing drugs: everyone is doing it! The culprit for this near-ubiquity of juiced-up numbers is also a familiar one: regulatory arbitrage.  In 2013, US banking regulators brought in effective caps on the level of leverage on investment banks’ debt deals. This well-intended effort to curb a potential bubble in riskier debt became the original sin of earnings adjustments. When banks underwrite an LBO, they take on the risk that they will not be able to sell on the debt to investors. Unsurprisingly, their main guide is whatever leverage they think bond and loan fund managers will be willing to accept. This appetite can sour quickly; Jefferies and Credit Suisse were last week left holding chunks of loans to Israel’s NSO Group. There, though, tepid investor demand had little to do with its rather modest 3.7 times leverage ratio and everything to do with corporate governance concerns about the cyber security group. More broadly, as more money has chased high-yield bonds and leveraged loans — the riskier types of corporate debt backing these buyouts — bankers found that the market would often tolerate much higher leverage than the regulators. So in order to get their deals within the lines, they started working with the private equity firms to heavily adjust earnings. While this tactic was originally used on the occasional punchy deal, everyone soon worked out that debt investors’ once strenuous objections to heavily massaged numbers had melted away in a hot market. It did not take long for the exception to become the rule. The biggest LBO since the financial crisis — Blackstone’s takeover of Thomson Reuters’ financial data business — included an epic $650m of annual pro forma cost savings. This allowed the world’s largest private equity firm to bring in the deal’s leverage ratio from a toppy seven times to a rather less worrisome 5.2 times. As a result of all these adjustments, Jonathan Butler, head of European leveraged finance at PGIM Fixed Income, said that on average, companies’ “senior leverage” — a measure of debt that has first cut on assets — was in reality “worse than it was in 2007”. The problem with all this is not hard to see: reality has a funny way of asserting itself in the end. In December, S&P looked at a sample of 50 LBOs from 2015 to see how their earnings over the following two years matched up to their initial adjustments. Unsurprisingly, the rating agency found out that “management projections proved aggressively optimistic”, with earnings in 2017 on average more than a third lower. Lower earnings mean higher leverage. If private equity firms are unable to live up to their lofty promises in a buoyant economy, imagine what slowing economic growth would mean for the sustainability of these towering debt stacks built on the shaky foundations of pro forma numbers.","16.04.2019"

"Global bond market has biggest inflows in more than 4 years","Investors seek safety due to worries over global economy and rate cut prospects","The global bond market has enjoyed its biggest weekly investor inflows in over four years, with investors dumping equity funds in favour of fixed income amid concerns that the international economy is wilting and central banks will have to cut interest rates.  Fixed income funds tracked by EPFR, a data provider, sucked in $17.5bn globally in the week ending June 5, the biggest inflows since February 2015. More highly rated “investment grade” funds took in $18.5bn — the biggest five-day inflow on record. In contrast, riskier corners of the bond market — such as emerging markets or junk-rated corporate debt — suffered outflows, and equity funds saw another $10bn seep out, taking the cumulative withdrawals this year to $155bn.  Buoyed by the more dovish stance by the US Federal Reserve, financial markets initially enjoyed a roaring start to the year. But the sudden re-emergence of global trade tensions in May has once again stirred concerns over the health of the US economy — and sparked speculation that policymakers will have to cut rates soon. “The Fed seems ready to grant Donald Trump his wish and lower interest rates,” said Alexander Krämer, an analyst at Commerzbank. “Both the homemade trade dispute the US has with the rest of the world and the decline in inflation over the past few months provide the rationale behind such a move.” The solidifying view that US interest rates have peaked and will soon head lower again also led investors to pull money out of US loan funds at the fastest pace this year. Lower interest rates weaken the attraction of loans, which pay a floating rate of interest that is tied to the ebb and flow of the Fed’s policy rate.  US loan funds suffered $1.4bn in outflows for the week ending June 5, the biggest one-week exodus from the floating-rate market since January 2, in the wake of the December stock market turmoil and the Fed first indicating a slower pace of interest rate increases in 2019.  “If they start cutting rates I think you will have another round of outflows from loan mutual funds,” said Michael Anderson, a strategist at Citi. Jay Powell, Fed chair, hinted that he was open to cutting interest rates if needed, promising to “act as appropriate” to keep US economic expansion on track despite the escalating trade war with China.  Investors now think at least two Fed rate cuts are likely before the end of the year, according to the prices of interest rate futures, and that three or even four are possible. The first move lower could come in July, but the Fed funds futures market indicates a decent chance that might come as early as later this month. “Without a deal, weak global and US growth will likely be persistent, forcing the Fed into a series of cuts,” warned James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse, adding that even a US-Chinese trade deal may not be enough to avert an “insurance cut” by the Fed to support growth. “Rising tariffs and growing uncertainty is a significant shock.”","07.06.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Dixons, Rocket Internet, Aston Martin, Carnival","Natixis tumbles as pressure grows on asset manager H20","Thursday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Dixons Carphone hit a record low on a profit warning, which it blamed on losses at its UK mobile operations. The electronics retailer cut its current-year headline profit before tax guidance to £210m, 30 per cent below consensus. Accelerating changes in the market for mobile phone contracts suggest the division will take two years to reach break-even, with a loss of about £90m expected for the 2020 financial year, Dixons warned. Full-year results from Dixons matched consensus forecasts and current-year guidance excluding mobile was as expected. “Whilst the market was already well aware that the UK Mobile [unit] was struggling, the scale of these downgrades will come as a disappointment to investors today and will inevitably lead to concerns as to how much worse things could get,” said Morgan Stanley.  However, Morgan Stanley highlighted that mobile phone sales now account for just 20 per cent of Dixons’ group revenue and less than 10 per cent of its shop floorspace. While the break-even targets “might seem optimistic, we think it important to bear in mind that the principal reason that UK Mobile is struggling is that the group is locked into punitive contracts with the UK network operators which require it to meet certain volume commitments, irrespective of market conditions, and that these contracts run out during 2020/21”. ● Cineworld dropped on news that its auditor KPMG had resigned on Monday. KPMG said in a separate statement that Cineworld had put the audit contract out to competitive tender and “we declined to participate as we did not consider that it was likely that we would be able to agree acceptable commercial terms”. ● Rocket Internet rose after Manager Magazin said the group’s supervisory board was working on options to potentially take the company private, and that chief executive Oliver Samwer was unlikely to sell any of his 44 per cent stake. Rocket declined to comment on the report, which revived long-term speculation around the German technology incubator.  “We see a strong rationale behind a potential buyback and taking the company private. Management has several times in the past highlighted its frustration with current share price levels and LPV [last portfolio value] valuations not replicated in Rocket’s share price — which looks unlikely to change short term.”JPMorgan Cazenove But while a take-private “would probably be a sensible move in terms of value generation, we question the funding potential”, JPMorgan continued. “Rocket’s share price is down 30 per cent since the company’s IPO and investors are . . . unlikely to accept a premium of less than 30 per cent, leading to a potential market cap of greater [than] €5bn at acquisition. Such a move would absorb almost all of Rocket’s current net cash balance (€3.1bn as of the first quarter 2019) with limited firepower for additional acquisitions/new launches.”
 ● Delivery Hero led the takeaway-ordering companies higher after it raised its full-year revenue guidance range by €200m to between €1.3bn and €1.4bn. Management said new market expansion and pay-offs from investment meant revenue growth would remain at up to 100 per cent for the remainder of 2019. The company also increased its second-half investment budget by €100m, meaning earnings forecasts moved lower. “One of the key questions on Delivery Hero in the last year has been: ‘Is all the investment going in actually going to yield a positive return?’ We started to get some positive signals in the first-quarter results but last night’s trading statement gives us a much firmer idea — it appears the answer is very much yes. Of course, competition in their markets is still evolving rapidly and funding isn’t showing signs of drying up any time soon, but this statement definitely reassures value is being created.”Barclays ● Carnival fell after cutting full-year earnings guidance, largely because of geopolitical and macro uncertainty in Europe. The cruise ship operator said lower fuel costs were offsetting a weaker outlook for ticket prices in the second half, along with the US ban on Cuban sailings and operational disruption from ship repairs.  The new guidance implying a 3 per cent earnings-per-share downgrade was “quite severe given the year is well sold by this stage”, said Morgan Stanley. It “will likely heighten fears of overcapacity, raise the risk that 2020 could be weaker still, raise questions over Carnival’s significant yield underperformance, and is negative for competitors given Carnival’s sheer scale”.  ● Natixis plunged after Morningstar suspended its rating on a fund run by H2O, the French investment manager’s flagship asset manager. The move followed a Financial Times Alphaville investigation into how much the fund had invested in illiquid bonds linked to German financier Lars Windhorst.  The under-fire €2.4bn Allegro Fund accounts for 7.5 per cent of H2O’s total assets under management. The 50.01 per cent stake in H20 held by Natixis provides an estimated 2 per cent of group earnings, analysts said. H2O is “one of Natixis’s main boutiques which has recently grown exponentially”, said research group AlphaValue. “Natixis has built its model via the aggregation of several boutiques in which it owns a majority. Whereas there will be some outflows at H2O, it remains to be seen whether this will impact other boutiques and, more importantly, to what extent it will affect Natixis’s specific multi-boutique model.” Daily newsletter

 Sellside stories ● Panmure Gordon started coverage of Aston Martin Lagonda with a “sell” rating and 802p target price.  “We acknowledge Aston Martin Lagonda’s ambition to create a sustainable luxury brand like Ferrari. However, we believe management has underestimated the capital required; the IPO should have been the platform to raise at least £1bn fresh equity for the company, not selling shareholders. The company is entering arguably the riskiest phase of its long-term plan with continuing negative free cash flow and rising net debt leaving little room for error for a highly capital-intensive business.”Panmure Luxury carmakers have been encouraged by recent growth to invest heavily in new models, with Ferrari planning to spend twice as much as Aston Martin, said Panmure, which added that the UK group was launching 12 new models by 2022 on just £1.6bn of capital expenditure. “Aston Martin needs to spend at least £1bn more to close the gap with Ferrari or it risks remaining stuck with the rest of the pack with unpredictable margins,” it said.  With Aston Martin’s debt equivalent to 2.6 times operating earnings, an unsuccessful product launch or a sudden market deterioration “could quickly increase the strain on the balance sheet and force the company to curtail its plans”, Panmure added.  ● In brief: Assura raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Bank of Ireland raised to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Barry Callebaut rated new “outperform” at Credit Suisse; CML Microsystems cut to “hold” at Stifel; CYBG upgraded to “outperform” at RBC; Dechra Pharma cut to “hold” at HSBC; Eurocell rated new “buy” at Goodbody; Evry cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Fresenius Medical raised to “overweight” at Barclays; Generali cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Helical Bar cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Lifco rated new “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; McBride cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Novo Nordisk cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Orsted downgraded to “sector perform” at RBC; Paragon cut to “underperform” at RBC; President downgraded to “add” at Peel Hunt; Roche upgraded to “buy” at Deutsche Bank and cut to “hold” at Liberum; Zurich Insurance raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan.

"Mining industry can ‘transcend’ China, says Glencore chief executive","Shift in Chinese economy has fuelled concerns on outlook for sector","The metals and mining industry can “transcend” its biggest customer China as rising global living standards and the shift to cleaner forms of energy drives demand for raw materials, according to Ivan Glasenberg, the billionaire boss of Glencore. For more than a decade miners have looked to China, ploughing billions of dollars into new projects and deals to feed the country’s seemingly insatiable appetite for commodities. But a shift towards consumer-led growth in China has raised concerns among investors about the growth prospects for the mining sector.  Speaking at an investor conference in Barcelona, Mr Glasenberg said urbanisation in Africa and parts of Asia along with the energy transition meant the industry had a bright future. “Our industry can transcend China’s journey to a consumption-led economy,” he said. “The future need for the commodities we produce is likely to be similar to the past — it is all about demographics.” He said lifting global living standards to developed world levels by 2050 will require an extra 428m tonnes of copper by 2050 — around two-and-half times the current global stock. The electrification of transport will also spur metal demand with an extra 3m tonnes of copper a year needed by 2030, as well as 2.3m tonnes of nickel and 263,000 tonnes of cobalt.  “By 2030 . . . EV demand is equivalent to almost double total new supply from all probable [copper] projects,” he said. However, Mr Glasenberg said growing mine supply was difficult because easy-to-develop, high-quality resources were running out.  “Remaining resources are increasingly hard to mine and often complicated by challenging locations, lower grades, more complex mineralogy, poor infrastructure and sub scale size.”  Glencore is one of the world’s biggest producers of copper, nickel and cobalt. It is also a major supplier of thermal coal, a fossil fuel that is burnt in power stations to generate electricity. Its shares have struggled to advance this year, hit by concerns about slowing global growth, revised guidance for its copper and nickel businesses and news of an investigation by the US commodity markets regulator into potential corrupt practices. “The company has already flagged likely further downgrades to full year production guidance in copper,” said Sam Catalano, an analyst at Credit Suisse, in a report.  “Furthermore, following the relatively weak first quarter, we see production being heavily second-half end weighted across most divisions and flag the risk of more wide ranging cuts to full-year guidance.”","14.05.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Ferguson, easyJet, Restaurant Group, Enel, Sanofi","Just Eat may be on the menu for its Naspers-backed rival, says Liberum","Tuesday 13:00 BST What’s happening ● Ferguson edged higher after the builders’ merchant revealed plans to demerge its UK business, Wolseley, and announced that group chief executive John Martin would step down in mid-November. The Americas-focused company, which had been targeted by activist investor Trian Fund Management, also said it was “considering the most appropriate listing structure for the group going forward”. The UK arm of Ferguson provides about 12 per cent of group revenues and less than 5 per cent of trading profit, said analysts. Shedding the domestic division would move Ferguson’s business closer to higher-rated US peers such as Watsco, Home Depot, Lowes and Fastenal, they said. “News of the demerger of the UK operations should be taken well given the drag on group growth and profits in recent years (6.3 per cent organic decline in 2018) . . . Ferguson trades on a discount to US peers despite a broadly similar growth and returns profile, which . . . is mainly due to the challenges the UK business has faced. With the potential demerger of the UK business . . . the stock’s valuation gap to US peers could close.”Goldman Sachs ● Restaurant Group dropped after the Wagamama owner booked a £115.7m impairment charge and onerous lease provisions, most of which stemmed from its leisure division. Andy Hornby, its new chief executive, said the group expected to exit at least 50 per cent of its 352 leisure sites at the first opportunity. Like-for-like sales growth had slowed to just 0.2 per cent in the past six weeks, from 4 per cent in the first half, as a relapse into declines for the leisure business offset other divisions, Restaurant Group said. In-line interim earnings from the Restaurant Group also showed debt rising to £317m, against £28.1m in adjusted profit before tax, due largely to last year’s Wagamama purchase. “The liability risk here is something investors should consider carefully. Some of the increase in provision relates to existing sites within the provision group, but there are some new sites that have entered this group. A key question is: is this provision sufficient? With a new CEO, this is potentially a clearing-the-decks exercise, but a sceptic would point out that there have been many previous impairments/provisions. Operating in an oversupplied industry is clearly a major ongoing challenge.”Barclays ● Just Eat was under pressure after Eminence Capital said it would vote against the food-ordering website’s planned takeover by Takeaway.com, saying the offer was “highly opportunistic” and a “gross undervaluation” of the UK marketplace.  Eminence on Monday disclosed a 4.38 per cent shareholding in Just Eat. The hedge fund also has a 1.56 per cent short position against Takeaway.com according to regulatory filings.  “We think it is increasingly likely the Just Eat bid will not be agreed, just as the agreed private equity bid for Scout24, was similarly rejected by shareholders. We would also agree the bid undervalues the company and it is likely that other bidders will emerge with the soon-to-be-listed Prosus the most likely candidate.”Liberum Shareholders of German classifieds publisher Scout24 were right to reject in May a €46 per-share bid from private equity as too low, as the stock has since risen to €52.80, Liberum said. It valued Just Eat at £13.60 a share compared with an implied value on Takeaway’s all-share bid of 770p to 780p. Amazon and Uber Eats were unlikely to be interested in mounting a counterbid for Just Eat given scrutiny from competition regulators, Liberum said. It chose Prosus, the soon-to-be-listed spin-off from Naspers, as the most likely candidate given it is a co-shareholder in iFood, Just Eat’s Brazilian portal. “Acquiring Just Eat would give Prosus immediate market leadership in 12 of the 13 countries plus the technology of SkipTheDishes, which has had phenomenal success in Canada,” the broker said. Sellside stories ● Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded easyJet from “hold” to “reduce” with an 820p target.  Brexit uncertainties meant easyJet was likely to publish its 2020 outlook along with full-year results in mid-November, rather than at a trading update at the beginning of October, Kepler said. The broker also cut 2020 capacity growth forecasts from 5 per cent to 3 per cent to reflect industry data suggesting easyJet added just 2.3 per cent of new capacity in its most recent quarter.  Fuel-cost hedging in 2020 was likely to add £180m to easyJet’s expenses, Kepler continued.  “While the company has had a good non-fuel cost performance year-to-date and guides for headline costs per seat excluding fuel to decline this year (helped by 10 per cent capacity growth), we believe it will be more difficult to achieve a non-fuel cost improvement if capacity growth slows.”Kepler Kepler forecast easyJet to report a 2020 annual profit before tax of £350m, down 20 per cent year-on-year and well below consensus expectations. Switching from a fleet valuation to the long-term average price-to-earnings ratio, it said: “While we think easyJet could be an acquisition target once the consequences of Brexit and easyJet’s contingency plans have been tested, until then we believe the stock will trade based on the company’s profitability.”  ● In brief: Ashmore cut to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Daimler raised to “buy” at UBS; Enel cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Grand City Properties cut to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Huntsworth rated new “outperform” at RBC; MTG raised to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Metso raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; PVA Tepla rated new “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Sanofi rated new “outperform” at Bernstein; Scatec Solar raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Telefónica raised to “outperform” at Macquarie; Voestalpine rated new “neutral” at Credit Suisse.

But when it comes to other finance and economics podcasts, it's a jungle out there. Brendan, being a pod-savant, quite helpfully has his own list of recommendations, and here's another one to treat your ears to. It's the latest episode of “Invest Like the Best”, a podcast hosted by quantitative fund O’Shaughnessy Asset Management's chief executive, Patrick O’Shaughnessy.  He had an hour-long conversation with Michael Mauboussin, formerly of Legg Mason Capital, Credit Suisse, and now Chief Investment Strategist at BlueMountain Capital.  Mauboussin is also an adjunct professor of finance at Columbia Business School, where he teaches the fabled “Security Analysis” course, once taken by a certain Cherry Coke guzzling son of a congressman from Omaha. Mauboussin is one of the smartest cookies on Wall Street, and in the discussion he delves deep into valuation, the sources of alpha and the problems of EV to ebitda. (If you want to explore further, we'd very much recommend his three books and multiple papers.) For the finance wonks out there, we hazard a guess there's not many others you'd want to hear from.

"Falling profits at US and UK companies need not spell trouble for portfolios","Margins, earnings and share prices are seldom so perfectly correlated","If a company’s share price is the sum of its future dividends (as per the dividend discount model) and those dividends can only be paid from earnings (as per company law), then equity investors are in for some bad news (as per the latest corporate earnings reports). A second consecutive quarter of falling profits at the US’s biggest public companies is about to trigger a technical earnings recession, presage lower dividends and depress share prices. If, however, share price movements are not so mathematical (as per recent market examples) and dividends not so essential (as per growth company performance), then there may be some better news (as per most wealth managers’ current analyses). A falling profit trend in the US, the UK or elsewhere need not mean your equity portfolio suffers. For most of the summer, market watchers were warning that S&P 500 companies would report an average 2.8 per cent fall in their earnings for the second quarter, based on FactSet estimates, following a 0.3 per cent decline in the first three months of the year. And these numbers had been flattered by share buybacks, which artificially boosted earnings per share by 2.1 percentage points in the second quarter, according to Credit Suisse. Earnings for FTSE 100 companies looked little better. According to the Profit Watch UK Q2 survey from broker The Share Centre, on a rolling 12-month basis the collective profits for companies outside the top 40 were down almost a fifth from their 2017 peak. In both markets, dividend growth also appeared to be slowing — as measured by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index — as company profit margins came under pressure from rising wages and higher commodity prices. Analysts at Bank of America said: “We have been highlighting risk to margins from rising input costs for companies that don’t have pricing power, as well as for labour-intensive companies and sectors amid rising wages.” They reckoned non-financial companies would report net margins of 10.8 per cent in the second quarter, down from 11.5 per cent 12 months earlier, resulting in a full-year margin contraction. US hedge fund Bridgewater cautioned: “There is a decent chance that we are at a major turning point for corporate margins and, if that is correct, US equities have a major valuation problem.” The US-China trade war is creating persistent uncertainty  Fortunately for wealth managers running US and UK equity portfolios, margins, earnings and share prices are seldom so perfectly correlated. In fact, as companies were confirming lower first-quarter numbers, the S&P 500 was moving higher on forecasts that the US Federal Reserve would cut interest rates. It is one reason, along with the unreliability of earnings forecasts, that most managers are ignoring the short-term data and taking a longer-term view. Fahad Kamal, chief market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros, points out that forecasts also suggest a rapid improvement to 6 per cent earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 — making summer “probably the trough for earnings growth”. His advice to fellow managers and clients is therefore: “Take long-term positions and get asset allocation correct over the cycle. Trying to over-engineer positions based on the noise of any single earnings season is a poor strategy.” Not least because the noise can be misleading. “We have seen quite a gap between earnings expectations and out-turns in the past,” says Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald. “Indeed, over the past five years on average, actual earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded estimated earnings by +4.8 per cent.” Over-engineering positions based on a single earnings season is a poor strategyFahad Kamal, chief market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros Alexandre Tavazzi, global strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, also notes that revisions to first-quarter earnings figures will probably mean there is no technical recession — at least, not until the third quarter. Or not at all, according to the analysis of HSBC Global Asset Management’s chief strategist Joseph Little. “The corporate profits data has softened and lost momentum, but across the range of indicators we look at there is little evidence of a profits recession,” he says. “For now, we remain pro-risk in our multi-asset portfolios, with some caution tactically after recent market strength.” Still, at Hassium Asset Management, the absence of an earnings recession is no reason not to question equity valuations. Chief executive Yogesh Dewan expects the second-quarter earnings season will prove “underwhelming but not recessionary” but finds it “hard to see significant upside from current levels” based on company fundamentals. Hence he has reduced a previous overexposure to equities and is now marginally underweight — even if still preferring the US relative to Europe and Asia. Similarly, other managers find plenty of non-earnings-related reasons to review portfolio allocations. “Among those, an outright trade war is a major threat,” says Tavazzi. It is a concern shared by Stéphane Monier, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “We reduced our equity allocation twice this year, first in February, then in May, bringing our global portfolio exposure to underweight,” he says. “These moves in our tactical positioning were a delicate balancing act as the persistent uncertainty around the US-China trade war kept weighing on trade.” At the same time, though, he acknowledges the economic factor that kept shares rising in the first quarter: “There are some important positives as well, namely central banks’ accommodative monetary policies.” Brooks Macdonald’s Park agrees — although earnings have been negative, this has been offset by an expansion in equity valuation multiples driven by likely US interest rate cuts. “Equities have been rerated on the expectation of central banks turning more dovish, in part seeking to mitigate against the slowdown in global trade,” he says. However, that adds another risk: “We do think on balance that central bank expectations are more likely to disappoint. We recently decided to reduce our global equities weighting.” Earnings are not entirely irrelevant, though, nor inevitably a negative for equities. As Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, correctly suggested in July, a positive surprise on depressed earnings forecasts might “support a push by the S&P 500 above the lofty 3000-mark”. Sometimes, it seems, models, laws and numbers behave as they should.","01.09.2019"
"Opening Quote: Woodford tests investors’ patience","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email. © Richard Cannon/FT Woodford Patient Capital Trust is asking investors to be a lot more patient. The board of the investment trust, managed by Neil Woodford, has said it is testing out other managers who could replace him. But the FT reported it was doing so back in June. Monday’s interim results could have been an opportunity for them to announce a successor to Woodford Investment Management. Instead there is a statement that the “Board continues to evaluate the position of the Portfolio Manager and remains in dialogue with other potential managers”.  Mr Woodford apologises for “an extremely disappointing six-month period” but insists “the majority of the businesses we have invested in are making good progress”. Net assets at WPCT fell 14 per cent in the year to June, a period which includes around four weeks following the suspension of his equity income fund.  The share price dropped more sharply still. The discount to net asset value (NAV) swelled from 10 per cent in June 2018 to 22 per cent at the end of June this year. Since the suspension, both net asset value and share price have become worse with further writedowns in WPCT’s portfolio: NAV is now 65p compared to 72p at the end of June, while the share price has slipped to 44p from 56p.  Susan Searle, who chairs the bulked-up board, reminds shareholders the trust is meant to provide patient capital. The company faces “a number of difficult issues” in the “near term”, she says, but “the Board’s focus is to navigate through the current challenges without unduly impacting these longer term potential returns to shareholders”. Investors may wish they would navigate a bit more swiftly.  Briefly © Reuters After cutting back on personal assistants and encouraging partners to file their own expenses as part of a cost-cutting drive, now KPMG has come for employees’ work mobiles. Hundreds of UK staff will have to hand back phones starting next month, though those with roles that involve a lot of travel or who “need to be contacted out of hours by their clients, customers or team” will be exempt. The firm is the smallest of the Big Four, but has the highest UK costs. People working in non-client facing roles and junior staff in administrative jobs will be the most heavily affected. Thomas Cook passengers face a long wait, even after two-thirds of those stuck overseas at the time of its collapse have been repatriated. The Civil Aviation Authority was meant to have a claims website up and running by Monday, a week after the travel group collapsed and went into liquidation. But now the online system will not go live until next Monday, and any refunds processed (other than those who had been paying by instalment) could take up to 60 days.  Illiquid investments are firmly in the Financial Conduct Authority’s sights. The watchdog has stepped up its checks on property funds as part of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit. Property funds can find it tough to sell assets during a market squeeze, when lots of investors try to pull out their money. That led several to gate during 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote. The FCA has widened the pool of open-ended property funds subject to daily monitoring. Smaller property funds, as well as those that suffered in the wake of the Brexit referendum, now have to deliver daily cash flow updates, the FT reports, as investors have stepped up withdrawals over the summer.  Ferrexpo, the London-listed Ukrainian iron ore pellet miner that has had some accounting trouble of late, has hit out against social media reports about its chief executive. Apparently there are allegations circulating that Kostyantin Zhevago “has been served with a notice of suspicion regarding an investigation in Ukraine relating to one of the businesses he owned until 2015”. Mr Zhevago told the board he has not received a notice of suspicion (and denies any allegations of wrongdoing). But Ferrexpo also wants to make clear that not only does the “public dissemination of such untrue information in the media” violate Mr Zhevago’s rights, it also “undermines the international authority and economy of the country of Ukraine”. That’s the social media trolls told, then.  Job Moves  Woodford Patient Capital Trust has another new non-executive. Raymond Abbott, the chairman of Foresight 4 VCT plc and Scottish Building Society will replace Louise Makin from October 1. After facing criticism over directors with connections to Neil Woodford, the trust has been recruiting new board members with broader experience of overseeing listed funds.  We’re looking to feature more job moves. If you’re in senior management and moving jobs or you know someone who is, let us know about it at quote@ft.com

 Beyond the Square Mile © Reuters Volkswagen is gearing up to fight the largest legal claim of its kind in modern German history, opening the latest chapter in the diesel emissions saga that has already cost the company more than $30bn. More than 400,000 German car owners have signed up to a landmark collective lawsuit over emissions test cheating, with the final number set to become clear after the initial oral hearing of the case on Monday. Lawyers for VW are confident the case will eventually be dismissed. Hellman & Friedman, the US buyout group, is exploring a bid to acquire a stake in Euroclear amid growing interest in one of the world’s largest securities depositories from other financial buyers, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the proposal. A potential offer — which could value Euroclear at up to £5bn — comes amid divisions among stakeholders in the Brussels-based company over whether it sells a majority or minority part of itself to new investors and follows interest from other private equity groups including CVC and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC. Forever 21, the fashion retailer whose constantly changing styles and low prices once made it a hit among young women, has filed for bankruptcy protection, felled by intense competition and its own aggressive global expansion. The privately owned, California-based company said on Sunday night that it planned to shut as many as 350 of its 800 stores around the world as part of a Chapter 11 restructuring. Those earmarked for closure are mainly in Europe and Asia.  Global dealmaking has eased to the slowest pace in more than two years, as fears of an economic slowdown sap corporate confidence and a $200bn tobacco industry merger was abandoned due to shareholder criticism. Total mergers and acquisitions activity has fallen 11 per cent so far this year to $2.8tn according to new figures from data provider Refinitiv.

"Stocks to watch: Rentokil, Purplebricks, Just Eat, Wirecard, Campari","Europe’s drinks companies have earned their premium valuations, says Bernstein","Tuesday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Rentokil dipped on competition worries after US-listed peer ServiceMaster expanded its European operations with the purchase of Nomor, the continent’s fourth-biggest pest control company. ServiceMaster agreed to pay $200m for Nomor, which has operations in Norway that overlap Rentokil’s business. The US company has also agreed to buy some UK pest control assets from Rentokil that were for sale to appease the Competition and Markets Authority. “Whilst the competitive landscape may slowly be evolving with ServiceMaster’s move into Europe, we do not believe this will impact Rentokil’s ability to grow profitably and sustainably. The group’s differentiated, digitally enabled go-to market strategy focused on service excellence and product innovation is a key point of differentiation. And to put things into perspective, Nomor is a $60m of sales business (circa £50m) versus Rentokil achieving over £1.4bn of sales in Europe.”Stifel ● IP Group led the FTSE 250 fallers after half-year results from the technology investor showed continued cash burn and revealed little new in terms of strategy or realisations. The company reported a 4 per cent fall in net asset value to 110.6p per share and net cash of £71m after a net outflow of £50.2m during the six months.  ● Cairn Energy jumped after increasing 2019 production guidance with a first-half trading update. The explorer raised targets by about 7 per cent at the midpoint to reflect better than expected yields from its EnQuest-operated North Sea wells. Exploration drilling in the UK’s Chimera basin would start shortly with results expected in about a month, Cairn said. The company added that there had been no discussion with partners about delaying the final investment decision on the SNE development in Senegal, due before the year-end. “Cairn Energy delivered a very solid first half, beating expectations on a number of fronts and also scoring highly on performance metrics. The group has positioned itself to increase its portfolio of producing assets over the medium term and it has also secured prospective exploration acreage positions. It is hard to pick holes in its performance but also note that, like its peers, it is struggling to break out of the cycle of oil price swings and market appetite for risk.”Davy ● Purplebricks soared after Dealreporter reported that Axel Springer, the estate agent’s 27 per cent shareholder, was interested in a full takeover. The report followed market speculation in June that Axel Springer’s advisers could sound out Woodford Investment Management, Purplebricks’ second-biggest shareholder with 19 per cent, about whether it would be interested in selling out.  ● Takeaway.com retreated, dragging lower its all-share merger target Just Eat, after sector peer Delivery Hero revealed it had hedged part of its 15 per cent stake in the Dutch food delivery service using an equity collar agreement. The news was seen as complicating a rumoured deal between Just Eat and South African internet and media company Naspers, which backs Delivery Hero and is scheduled to float its consumer arm Prosus in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Traders also noted a cautious note from Citigroup analysing web traffic and app usage across the sector. “Recent trends suggest market acceleration in some of Just Eat’s markets, driven by high increased competitive intensity, which should be supportive for third-quarter revenue growth trends. However, peers are outpacing Just Eat’s growth in the UK, Canada and potentially Brazil, which suggests some ceding of market share.”Citi Sellside stories ● Bernstein Research upgraded Campari, Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Carlsberg from “underperform” to “market perform” as part of a European drinks sector review.  The price-to-earnings premium investors were prepared to pay for drinks makers in Europe has widened from a 12-year average of 35 per cent to nearly 60 per cent, said Bernstein. “With the benefit of hindsight, we now believe that most of this re-rating is justified. Compared to 10 years ago, some other sectors’ earnings power appears to be permanently impaired . . . In theory, the stable growth and highly cash-generative nature of European beverages warrants a higher premium than was the case 10 years ago.” While many consumer staples companies have faced disruption from entrants and changing consumer habits, the drinks groups have been delivering 5 per cent-plus organic sales growth consistently so deserve their premium, Bernstein said.  ● JPMorgan Cazenove started coverage of Wirecard, the German payments processing company, with a “neutral” rating and €165-a-share price target. Wirecard is substantially cheaper than peers after accounting for predicted growth, which is “a function of accounting-related controversies”, JPMorgan told clients.  “Given the multiple controversies that Wirecard has faced over the last five years, the discount the stock has to peers is unlikely to go away quickly despite the growth. The SoftBank investment will potentially help mitigate the discount over time if this partnership brings Wirecard a series of high-quality ecommerce companies as customers. Thus a re-rating . . . is a mid-term process hence we will wait on the deal flow particularly associated with high-quality ecommerce companies to be more bullish on the stock despite the clear valuation discount that the stock has.”JPMorgan The broker preferred Worldline, which it gave an “overweight” rating and €74 target price. It said the stock was valued “essentially in line with the sector average” even though its returns were constrained by a global consolidation strategy that should deliver much higher growth and margins in the medium term.  “Worldline has all the good properties of payments companies in that it is exposed to a market that is growing slightly more than mid-single digit while improving margin. The shift to card-based payments will help Worldline continue to grow for multiple years at more than mid-single-digit growth . . . Given the structural trends towards non-cash payments, Worldline should be a multiyear compounder.”JPMorgan ● In brief: Admiral raised to “buy” at Investec; Air Liquide raised to “neutral” at Citigroup; Amplifon cut to “hold” at Jefferies; BASF cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; BNP Paribas cut to “sell” at Société Générale; Columbus Energy rated new “buy” at FinnCap; Covestro cut to “sell” at Citigroup; DSV rated new “underperform” at Bernstein; Demant raised to “buy” at Jefferies; GN cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; Lanxess cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Mitchells & Butlers cut to “add” at Peel Hunt; Motor Oil raised to “buy” at UBS; RSA cut to “sell” at Investec; Repsol raised to “buy” at UBS; SSE raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Siegfried rated new “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Sonova raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Tesco cut to “hold” at HSBC; Unilever cut to “add” at Investec.

Anyone who has discussed getting on the property ladder in London is likely familiar with the term “the bank of mum and dad”, but in today’s DD we’d like to introduce you to the bank of the Holy Father.  When Italian financier Raffaele Mincione, below, wanted to realise his investment in an upmarket London property, he didn’t turn to his parents. Mincione aimed higher.   The former banker struck a deal in 2014 with Giovanni Angelo Becciu, below front, the second-highest ranking official in the Secretariat of State, for the Vatican to invest in the former Harrods motor car showroom at 60 Sloane Avenue, which he planned to make a killing on as luxury flats.   Now the deal is slightly complicated so we strongly suggest that you read the full article by Miles Johnson and Donato Paolo Mancini.

With the knowledge of Becciu, who is now a cardinal, the financier sold a stake in 60 Sloane Avenue to the Vatican fund at three times the price he initially paid when he invested in the property.  How? Just one month before the deal, a new appraisal by CBRE had increased the value of the equity in the building to £137.66m — a near £100m profit in less than two years. That means Mincione sold the Vatican a 45 per cent stake in the equity of the building at the new valuation, while himself cashing out more than the value of his entire initial investment.  It’s unclear why Becciu and his advisers at Credit Suisse agreed to the deal. An act of faith perhaps? All the while the Vatican was paying Mincione millions in fees. Mincione and his company have denied any impropriety.   By 2016 it actually looked like the Vatican’s investment in the Chelsea property was going to pay off. Then Brexit happened.  Plans for the building’s development hit a snag and by 2018 Mincione was faced with the Secretariat asking him to sell the whole building to them.  Later the Secretariat had to get a loan from the Vatican bank to refinance expensive debt attached to the property. This set into motion a chain of events that has seen five members of the Holy See’s staff suspended and thrown the Vatican’s oversight on its financial dealings into question.  With 122,000 square feet of prime London real estate, the Vatican is now exposed to the whims of Britain’s chaotic politics. Maybe money is indeed the root of all evil.  This article has been revised since its original publication.
 Martina Merz: third time’s a charm for Thyssenkrupp?  Martina Merz has nerves of steel. She is the first woman to run a large listed German company in modern history and has taken on a job that many have called a “poisoned chalice”.  As the new chief executive of German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, and the company’s third leader in 15 months, Merz has taken on the daunting task of dismantling the heavily indebted group. Many view her as someone who will put the pedal to the metal.   First on the chopping block is the company’s prized elevator division — a business her predecessor was desperate to keep a hold of — which could fetch up to €20bn and give Thyssenkrupp a much needed lift.  There’s no shortage of interest for the unit. US private equity groups Blackstone and Carlyle have teamed up for a potential bid, as Bloomberg first reported and DD confirmed, as have Advent International, Cinven and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. There are also talks of CVC Capital Partners teaming up with Kone, the Finnish maker of lifts, which might help avoid competition concerns that a sale to the rival lifts business could raise. Thyssenkrupp is all too familiar with how disruptive a no-go from EU antitrust enforces can be.  The outcome of the bidding wars is uncertain but one thing is for sure, Thyssenkrupp desperately needs a cash injection.  Merz also has to tackle problems at another core business, Thyssenkrupp steelworks. There’s talk of a long-floated merger with another German steelmaker, Salzgitter, but the lift business will have to be handled first.  The breaking up of the business will involve thousands of job losses, so Merz will need to brace herself for a backlash from unions.  Go deeper with this just published piece by the FT’s Joe Miller in Frankfurt here. Gupta is in a bit of a legal bother   From nerves of steel to man of steel.  Sanjeev Gupta could be in serious legal trouble in India over the failed Liberty House move for Amtek Auto.  On Thursday, an Indian court will consider whether Gupta should face criminal prosecution for not following through on the takeover of the bankrupt car parts maker. The steel magnate faces between one and five years in prison if convicted.  Gupta, who has built a sprawling conglomerate of privately owned businesses by snapping up unwanted or failed assets, claims Liberty House learnt of irregularities in the company’s books after bidding, invalidating the process. Sounds like a due diligence problem.  GFG Alliance, of which Liberty House is a part, said the charges “have no merit”.  By now DD readers know the industrialist well enough to know that the case comes at an inopportune time. There’s a big spotlight on GFG’s unconventional finances, which we’ve told you about previously.

"Stocks to watch: Kraft Heinz, InBev, Dairy Crest, Provident Financial","Codemasters’ resilience is undervalued, says Berenberg","Friday 11:00 GMT What’s happening ● Kraft Heinz shares dropped in US pre-market trading after the company delivered a barrage of bad news overnight. Kraft Heinz posted much weaker than expected fourth-quarter profit, lowered its 2019 guidance for earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and depreciation by about 15 per cent, booked a $15.8bn writedown on its two most important brands, cut its dividend to focus on debt repayments and revealed it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan, Stifel, UBS and Piper Jaffray all took Kraft Heinz off their “buy” lists in response. “We have been bullish on Kraft for its role as a likely consolidator in packaged food, but now believe we likely were overly optimistic in both its likelihood of getting a sizeable deal done and of the quality of the growth profile for any ensuing company. In light of its $15bn writedown on its key Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, we are not confident it can build or maintain brand equity needed to compete in today’s consumer environment in a sustainable, compelling way.”Piper Jaffray JPMorgan said it could have maintained a positive stance “if we still had confidence in the company’s strategy. But we are concerned that as soon as leverage comes down it will jump right back up when the next deal is completed.” “If we could sum up Kraft’s issues in one stat it would be this: the midpoint of 2019 ebitda guidance ($6.4bn) is below what Kraft printed on a pro forma combined basis in 2014 ($6.5bn). We thus think it is more than fair to ask if any fundamental value for Kraft has been created since the Kraft Heinz merger.”JPMorgan The struggles of Kraft Heinz and brewer AB InBev raise questions on the entire strategy of 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment group backing both groups, JPMorgan added. “Investors for years have asked if 3G’s extreme belt-tightening model ultimately would result in brand equity erosion. We think the answer arguably came yesterday in the . . . asset writedown.” AB InBev was the Stoxx 50’s sharpest faller. ● Dairy Crest jumped after the cheesemaker agreed a takeover offer from Saputo of Canada. The 620p-a-share offer valued Dairy Crest at £975m, or just over 13 times 2019 ebitda on an enterprise-value basis. The stock had outperformed the broader market in recent days, jumping 17 per cent since February 14 on much higher than average volume. Jefferies analysts said the valuation looked fair against sector deals such as Post Holdings’ purchase of Weetabix and Yildiz’s buyout of United Biscuits, at prices equivalent to 11.8 times ebitda and 10.5 times ebitda respectively. Shareholders may nevertheless look back on Dairy Crest’s recent highs above 600p in the middle of 2017, the broker added.  ● Provident Financial edged higher after Non-Standard Finance, the company founded in 2014 by its former chairman, launched a nil-premium takeover offer.  NSF said it had support from shareholders with more than 50 per cent of Provident voting rights, including key investors Invesco and Woodford Investment Management, for its proposal to swap 8.88 of its shares for each Provident share held. The group’s proposal involved refocusing the enlarged group on credit cards, home credit, branch-based lending and guarantor loans. The home loans division would be spun off and the car finance and online instalment businesses would be disposed. The offer follows Provident last year agreeing to pay £170m in compensation and a £2m fine after the Financial Services Authority found it had not properly informed customers about the full cost of an add-on product offered by its Vanquis credit card unit known as the Repayment Option Plan. “Our initial reaction is that an NSF-Provident [combination] could offer better returns, more quickly, than Provident could achieve standalone. However, we see FCA approval of NSF proposals as key. For example, NSF intends to reintroduce [the] Repayment Option Plan at Vanquis, reduce the length of home credit loans and introduce a more flexible operating model including a variable pay structure and flexible working hours for customer experience managers. These are measures we believe Provident would have loved to implement itself, but has so far been unable to do so.”Citigroup Sellside stories ● Berenberg upgraded Codemasters from “hold” to “buy” with a 260p target in a UK video game sector review. It also had “buy” ratings on Frontier Developments, Team17, Sumo Digital and Keywords Studios. Jitters stemming from China’s delayed game approvals and the dominance of Fortnite have been holding back the UK video game makers, even though they are well insulated from the trends thanks to their niche product slates and geographic positioning, said Berenberg. “With some industry headwinds subsiding and UK valuations still 25 per cent lower from highs, we believe this is an opportune time to revisit some of these names,” it said. On Codemasters, Berenberg had been cautious because of a disappointing performance for its Onrush driving combat title. However, it said the group’s core collection of racing games has delivered more resilient financials than feared. This, combined with a strong pipeline for next year and meaningful potential upgrades from a development agreement with Netease of China, gives Codemasters a pathway to significant returns in the stock over the next year and suggests that a 30 per cent discount to peers is too wide, Berenberg said.  ● In brief: BPER Banca raised to “buy” at HSBC; Centrica downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Cranswick rated new “buy” at Panmure Gordon; DKSH raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; DNB upgraded to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Delivery Hero cut to “neutral” at Macquarie; EDF downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; GCP Student Living rated new “buy” at Jefferies; Georg Fischer cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Inwit upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Jersey Oil & Gas rated new “buy” at FinnCap; Kaz Minerals downgraded to “sell” at VTB Capital; Non-Standard Finance downgraded to “reduce” at Peel Hunt; Nordea cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Retail Estates cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Sabadell cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Sartorius downgraded to “sell” at Berenberg; Secure Income cut to “sell” at Peel Hunt; Serco upgraded to “hold” at Stifel; Telenor upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Wartsila cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse;  Read more

"DMGT lifted by rise in revenue from MailOnline","Shares in Daily Mail publisher jump 10 per cent on better than expected results","Daily Mail and General Trust reported a jump in underlying profit, sending the tabloid publisher’s shares up as much as 10 per cent.  Adjusted underlying pre-tax profits climbed 19 per cent to £100m in the six months to the end of March, as underlying revenue inched up 1 per cent to £724m.  Paul Zwillenberg, chief executive, said the performance came amid strength in the company’s consumer media division, which includes news titles such as the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro, and “continued growth” in the business-to-business portfolio. DMGT shares rallied 10 per cent in early trading, putting them on track for their sharpest rise since November 2012, according to Refinitiv data.   The company also said it had sold its 40 per cent stake in US-based Real Capital Analytics for $89m, and planned to offload its German On-geo business in a deal expected to close next month.  Those moves come as DMGT seeks to slim down its portfolio.  In April it spun off its £662m stake in publisher Euromoney to shareholders. Roughly a year ago, the group also sold EDR, a commercial real estate service, and its stake in ZPG, the company behind property website Zoopla. “The strategy we are pursuing is transforming DMGT and delivering results,” Mr Zwillenberg said. “The distribution of our stake in Euromoney . . . was a defining moment for DMGT.” He told investors he had made some “difficult decisions” regarding the company’s portfolio. “In the end we are a portfolio manager,” he said. “If an asset is worth considerably more to someone else and they make a good offer — we’ll consider it.”  Statutory profit before tax in the six-month period fell 56 per cent to £50m. The company said this was largely the result of impairment charges of £28m for Euromoney and £21m for On-geo. Reported revenues were down 3 per cent from the year before on a statutory basis.  Revenues from the media business, which makes up almost half of the group total, grew to £343m, up 3 per cent from the year before. The company’s Metro free sheet reported a 12 per cent jump in sales to £41m, as it benefited from the integration of advertising operations with the Mail. Growth in the media business was led by a 25 per cent like-for-like jump in MailOnline revenues to £76m, which partially offset a 2 per cent drop in circulation revenues to £144m from the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers. The “continued decline” in Mail sales was further slowed down by a 5p price rise for weekday editions to 70p. The company said it expected revenue growth and operating margins in its media outlets to be lower in the second half of the year, but said guidance for the full year remained broadly unchanged as full-year revenues were expected to decline “in the low-single digits rather than the mid-single digits previously guided to”. Analysts from Credit Suisse said the company was making “good strides” in its simplification programme but said it had “yet to demonstrate a return to consistent group top-line growth.”","30.05.2019"
"Clock ticks for investors to reclaim SFr15bn of Swiss commissions","Practice of fund rebates ended in 2012 but claimants have been slow to act","Time is running out for investors to reclaim up to SFr15bn ($15.4bn) in investment fund commissions that was pocketed by Swiss banks. Swiss lenders historically received lucrative commissions from asset managers, whose products they pushed to their wealth management clients.  These rebates, which were as high as 2 per cent of assets in some cases, generated SFr4.2bn for banks in 2012, equivalent to 12.4 per cent of the sector’s profits, according to analysis by consultancy Finalix of data provided by the Swiss Bankers Association.  The practice came to an end in 2012 when Switzerland’s highest court banned banks from retaining commissions. The ruling was significant for Switzerland’s largest banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer, as it applied to commissions paid by a lender’s in-house asset management unit to its wealth division.  The Federal Supreme Court ruled that such commissions belong to the end investor and can be claimed back, yet few claims have been submitted and investors are running out of time, according to litigation experts. Nicolas Ollivier, counsel at law firm Lalive, which specialises in banking litigation, said: “After the ruling of 2012, the financial industry expected a wave of requests from clients claiming back retrocessions [but] few clients asked for reimbursement.” He added that claims tended to be made only when mismanagement disputes arose between investors and their banks. “There are still huge amounts unclaimed,” he said. Investors can submit claims for up to 10 years after the commissions were paid, meaning that wealthy clients who entrusted their money to Swiss wealth managers in 2009 will lose the ability to claw back what is owed to them at the end of this year.  Hubert Schwärzler, chief executive of Liti-Link, a claims management specialist, estimated that the amount of unclaimed retrocessions could be as high as SFr15bn for the three-and-a-half years still within the 10-year limitation period, assuming that Swiss banks earned about SFr4.2bn annually at that time.  According to Mr Schwärzler, clients who invested large sums with Swiss banks could recover six-digit sums, given that they are entitled to 5 per cent interest a year. “The problem is that hardly any investors know about the possibility of recovering retrocessions,” he said. “Due to [the limitation period], large sums expire daily in favour of the banks.” Claiming back commissions retained by banks was more complicated until recently, as different Swiss courts were divided on the duration of the limitation period and whether investors should be entitled to interest payments. Mr Schwärzler said this allowed some banks to dismiss claims by saying the limitation period had already expired and to refuse to pay interest. However, a separate federal court ruling in 2017 clarified these issues, paving the way for more claims to be made. Mr Schwärzler said international investors were beginning to show more interest in claiming back commissions owed to them. Back in 2012, they did not act as they were focused on repatriating assets held in Swiss bank accounts following an international tax evasion crackdown. “They [are realising] they were ripped off in Switzerland and now they want their money back,” said Mr Schwärzler. German and Italian investors are waking up to the issue, he said, but UK investors — which account for 27 per cent of assets in Swiss bank accounts, according to the Swiss National Bank — have been slow to act.  The issue has wider implications for wealth managers. A legal ruling last year means that banks that do not inform clients of retrocessions that they received may be guilty of criminal mismanagement.  Switzerland’s move to ban commissions coincided with rebate bans introduced by the UK and the Netherlands. Mifid II, which came into force last year, banned discretionary wealth managers and independent advisers from accepting commissions, although restricted advisers can still receive them. Mr Schwärzler said the Swiss case could have implications for other European countries. Liti-Link is seeking to help German investors push for a court ruling similar to the Swiss one that would force banks and wealth managers to retrospectively pay rebates to customers.","30.06.2019"
"Software sector braces for a split among leading companies","Predictions of IT downturn leave investors hunting for who is best placed to ride it out","Fresh from a powerful three-year surge, the software industry is entering a new period of uncertainty. But for companies that look as if they can stay the course, Wall Street’s enthusiasm is undimmed. Shares in Salesforce, the leading software-as-a-service player, surged more than 6 per cent on Thursday after a quarterly earnings report that dispelled recent worries about flagging growth. Meanwhile, tax and small business software company Intuit, which has seen its stock market value jump nearly threefold over the past four years, to $71bn, forecast another solid year of growth, sending its shares up 5 per cent. On the same day, however, shares in data centre software company VMware fell more than 5 per cent, as it reduced its key licence revenue forecast for the rest of this year and unveiled the two largest acquisitions in its history, for a combined $4.8bn. Meanwhile, data analytics company Splunk, which reported earnings the day before, dropped 8 per cent on a disappointing cash flow forecast. The divergence points to a growing separation in the expected fortunes of leading software companies, as Wall Street searches for those best placed to ride out what many fear will be a broader downturn in IT as big customers pull in their spending. With valuations in the sector looking highly stretched after the long rally, recent slips have been punished severely. Shares in Zoom — the video conferencing company that debuted on Wall Street earlier this year — currently change hands for nearly 50 times this year’s expected revenue, a symptom of sky-high expectations for many of the new cloud-based players. The software industry has just been through “a once-in-20-years infrastructure cycle”, said Brad Zelnick, software analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. That has been capped by a surge in sales over the past 12 months, he added, driven by a number of factors, including a US tax cut, a shift to “hybrid cloud” platforms that has seen many companies overhaul their basic IT infrastructure to combine their existing facilities with new cloud services, and a new urgency to accelerate their “digital transformation” to make their businesses more agile. After that burst of growth, year-on-year comparisons are starting to look challenging. According to Mr Zelnick, infrastructure software companies like VMware are losing momentum compared to cloud services that are seen as critical to how businesses are repositioning themselves in the digital age. Along with Adobe, Salesforce is “one of the first two cars on the digital transformation freight train,” he said. Uncertainty ahead Two things are complicating the picture as the software industry faces more uncertain times. One involves the business model changes the sector has been going through as it adjusts to a new reality in which cloud-based subscription services come to represent a bigger share of sales. Splunk, for instance, said that its disappointing cash flow forecast reflected a move to a new way of charging which will see more payments delayed into future periods. VMware, meanwhile, blamed a disappointing licence revenue forecast for the rest of this year on an accelerating shift to subscriptions in part of its business, which also results in more revenue being deferred until later periods.  Perhaps inevitably, however, Wall Street chose to see the disappointing forecasts as partly a sign of the dark economic clouds that are starting to gather. Pointing to the economic uncertainty, Pat Gelsinger, VMware’s chief executive officer, conceded: “There is uncertainty, and nobody is immune from that.” The second factor complicating the picture has been a rise in mergers and acquisitions, as software companies look for new avenues of growth. This week, VMware — which is majority owned by Dell — announced two purchases for a total of $4.8bn — security company Carbon Black, for $2.1bn, and cloud tools developer Pivotal, which had been majority owned by Dell, for $2.7bn. 
 According to Mr Gelsinger, the deals reflect a shift to “hybrid cloud”. But VMware’s purchases received a mixed reception from Wall Street analysts, who questioned why it was acquiring the minority in Pivotal when Dell already controlled the company, and whether Carbon Black was too small a company to make VMware a real player in the security market. “The organic growth is starting to slow down, so they’re starting to turn to acquisitions,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at IT research firm Nucleus Research. Growth in Salesforce’s original sales software fell to 13 per cent this quarter, compared to the 22 per cent growth in its newer customer service business. “They’ve dominated the market for quite a while and it’s starting to get tapped out,” Mr Elman added. ‘We see a buying environment’ The acquisitions have also weighed on Salesforce’s profit margins — contributing to long-run unease on Wall Street about the company’s failure to boost margins more as its business has grown. Announcing its latest quarterly figures this week, however, Salesforce predicted a further boost to the profit margins on its “organic”, or existing, businesses in the coming months, even as it steps up the acquisitions. “We do make trade-offs between our organic growth and margin,” said Mark Hawkins, the company’s chief financial officer. “We’ve made considerable progress over the years, but we know there’s more to be done.” Central to Wall Street’s optimism about Salesforce, along with other software companies that continue to trade close to all-time highs, is a belief that they will weather harder economic times better than most other parts of the tech industry. Salesforce, for instance, reported revenue growth of 30 per cent in Europe this quarter, and singled out a new contract with a bank in Italy as evidence that demand for its software can withstand political upheaval. “Whatever is going on around the world, we see a buying environment, we see CEOs investing,” said Keith Block, Salesforce chief operating officer. “Top of mind for this is digital transformation.” The question now is whether this sort of spending will continue to hold up in a slowing economy — and how many other software companies will prove resilient when broader IT spending takes a dip.","25.08.2019"
"Paradoxes plague Wall Street’s record-breaking run","Uncertain growth backdrop means now is not the time to make bold bets on stocks","US stocks have soared to records this year despite earnings remaining flat. This is just one paradox stalking 
markets that should unnerve equity investors. Stock indices reached milestones this week with the S&P 500 hitting the 3,000 mark and the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaching 27,000 points. The best June since 1955 capped a surging first half of the year that has returned 17 per cent to investors, its best showing since 1997. Yet the jubilation may soon fade. The second-quarter earnings season begins next week but the outlook offers little to excite investors. Growth in earnings per share, one of the most widely watched gauges for the health of US stocks, risks slipping into negative territory. This would mark the second consecutive quarter of shrinking earnings for US stocks — the technical marker of an earnings recession, according to FactSet data. Poor earnings will squeeze profit margins, forcing investors to ask whether stocks have any more room to rise. Emily Roland, head of capital markets research for John Hancock Investment Management, anticipates a “war on margins” as companies report to investors this month. “A lot of sectors will be under margin pressure,” Ms Roland said. Fund managers would be wise to position portfolios for defence, she adds. “Boring is beautiful — it’s not a great time to make bold bets with this uncertain growth backdrop.” Dimming data from America’s manufacturing sector, the China-US trade conflict and a slowing in US gross domestic product are testing the nerves of equity investors. Andrew Sheets, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, has recommended clients cut the weighting of equities in their portfolios due to the dismal outlook for economic growth and earnings. “We think the market is too optimistic on 2019 earnings and is underestimating the pressure from inventories, labour costs and trade uncertainty,” Mr Sheets said. Tech companies are particularly vulnerable to the tightest employment market in half a century. Labour costs account for 16 per cent of annual revenue for tech companies, according to Morgan Stanley, the second-highest proportion across sectors after industrials. Even the rosy prospect of monetary easing has its limits. The Federal Reserve is expected to trim interest rates in July, but that dovish tilt will be offset by the negative impact of weakening growth in the US and abroad, adds the bank. “We think a repeated lesson for stocks over the last 30 years has been that when easier policy collides with weaker growth, the latter usually matters more for returns,” Mr Sheets added. Herein lies another paradox: economic expansion is necessary to drive stocks higher, but too much frothiness among equities risks stifling the Fed’s appetite to lower interest rates. If the central bank were to even delay a rate cut, it would certainly trigger a pullback in US stocks given the 
overwhelming expectations for multiple cuts this year. The prospect of falling rates has become a crutch for US stocks. Lower rates will reduce already inexpensive borrowing costs for companies, allowing them to continue to binge on cheap debt to fuel growth. One way companies are spending this money is on their own shares. While growth in capital expenditure has come off the lofty highs reached last year, when the lower corporate tax rate encouraged companies to spend, share buybacks have blossomed. US companies spent $206bn on share repurchases in the first quarter, broadly in line with the $805bn spent in the whole of 2018, a record year. Credit Suisse analysts expect share buybacks to add a full 2 per cent to the earnings-per-share total for the S&P 500 in the second quarter, which may be just enough to nudge it into positive growth territory and stave off an earnings recession. “That’s the impact of stock buybacks,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equities strategist for the bank. “The trend remains anaemic regarding earnings but we don’t see an earnings recession.” Investors may want to consider one paradox above all others, as they navigate potential perils. The stock market typically performs best during the last leg of a cycle, as surging optimism and lax borrowing inflate valuations. Missing out on that upswing may hurt more than suffering with everybody else in the downswing. “The US stock market is still the best game in town,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade. “We’re in a market at all-time highs yet people are complaining about how bad it is.” richard.henderson@ft.com

"Stocks to watch: RBS, IAG, Thomas Cook, Taylor Wimpey, Intertek","Premier Oil’s cash crunch makes disposals a priority, says Barclays","Friday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Royal Bank of Scotland hit its lowest since late 2016 after weak second-quarter underlying earnings eclipsed a 12p special dividend from the lender, which was 8p more than expected. Net interest income was 6.5 per cent below consensus at £2bn as lower rates and tougher competition put pressure on margins.  RBS management also scrapped a 2020 returns target, saying the current operating environment made it very unlikely. “Arguably no one ever believed it anyway, but the scale of near-term pressure disappoints,” said Investec. ● British Airlines owner IAG 
bounced from a two-and-a-half-year low on better than expected interim results and reiterated full-year guidance.  IAG’s second-quarter headline earnings of €960m beat consensus forecasts by 5 per cent thanks to steady ticket pricing and non-fuel cost cutting. “Holding guidance for 2019 illustrates resilience at a time when market confidence is low,” said Credit Suisse.  ● Thomas Cook gained in response to continued stakebuilding by Neset Kockar, the founder and chairman of Turkey-based peer Anex Tour. A regulatory filing showed that Mr Kockar had raised his stake in the tour operator to 8.01 per cent from 6.71 per cent disclosed earlier in the week. “We believe Thomas Cook has more value and potential than what is being discussed recently, particularly with the skillset and complementary capabilities Anex Tour shall put forward,” Mr Kockar told Bloomberg News. “We are keen to explore further the potential strategic initiatives related to Thomas Cook and engage with the relevant stakeholders.” Sellside stories ● Barclays downgraded UK explorer Premier Oil from “overweight” to “equal weight” with a 120p target. It said: “The current pace of free cash flow generation is not rapid enough to stop debt refinancing risks becoming a headwind for the stock.” With Premier delivering operationally its 30 per cent discount to tangible net asset value might be expected to close, Barclays said. However, it forecast net debt to remain above two times the relevant earnings measure through 2020, complicating financing negotiations with lenders ahead of debt facilities maturing in 2021. A $5 move in the price of a barrel of Brent crude shifts Premier’s valuation by 20 per cent, it estimated. “The good news is that we believe the portfolio has credible divestment candidates, while management also has a track record for accretive acquisitions. Our concern is that net debt of more than $2bn could cast an increasingly large shadow over an otherwise robust investment case the longer the market is left waiting for an inorganic solution to improve the balance sheet.”Barclays At the current pace of debt reduction Premier would take more than six years to clear 2019 year-end debt, which exceeds an estimated mid-case field reserve life of 5.6 years, Barclays said. It also highlighted that Premier traded at deeper discounts to net asset value during the 2016 and 2017 debt refinancing processes. Premier’s minority stake in a discovery off the coast of Mexico would be the obvious disposal candidate with a value of about $290m, Barclays said. It also noted that while Premier’s south-east Asian fields had become peripheral to the business, they were still contributing about a quarter of core operating earnings so a good price would be needed. ● Citigroup upgraded Taylor Wimpey from “neutral” to “buy” with a 167p target price. Poorly received interim results this week from the housebuilder led to a derating that has made the risk-reward more favourable, Citi said. “On our estimates, the stock offers annualised net asset growth (including dividends) of circa 17 per cent over 2019 to 2021. The group’s healthy cash generation supports ongoing dividend payouts and the current valuation looks attractive with dividend yield of circa 11.5 per cent. In addition we see potential for cost rationalisation given the steep rise in build costs over the last year, driving upside risk to our 2021 estimates.”Citi The broker’s bear case was for a UK recession to trigger a 20 per cent drop in sales volumes and a 10 per cent drop in house prices. Even then, it said, Taylor Wimpey would remain cash generative, with free cash flow comfortably supporting minimum dividend payment of circa £250m a year through the cycle. ● Kepler Cheuvreux and Société Générale downgraded Intertek, the product testing and certification specialist, to “reduce” and “sell” respectively. Both brokers argued that Thursday’s interim results from Intertek did not justify a valuation in excess of 25 times earnings, towards the top of its recent trading range, at a time when forecasts were not moving higher. ● In brief: AMS cut to “neutral” at Oddo; BAE Systems cut to “hold” at SocGen; Belimo cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Centrica raised to “hold” at Investec; Codemasters rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Equinor raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Fevertree rated new “neutral” at Citigroup; Fresnillo cut to “hold” at HSBC; Galp cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Kone raised to “neutral” at JPMorgan; LafargeHolcim raised to “hold” at SocGen; Premier Oil cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; SocGen raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Strix rated new “buy” at Stifel.

"Online retailers hit after copycat competition warning","Asos and Boohoo among stocks under pressure after Merrill Lynch statement","Asos and Boohoo were under pressure after Merrill Lynch predicted that the online retailers would struggle against a wave of copycat competition.  The rise of online shopping and broader consumer choice had failed to boost industry revenue, with fast fashion growing at its slowest pace since the credit crunch, Merrill said. Naming a dozen small brands that already competed directly with Asos and Boohoo in the UK, it argued that investors had underestimated the drag on margins from market fragmentation and “unavoidable” promotions.  Smurfit Kappa led the paper and packaging stocks higher after saying year-to-date volumes had improved.  A Credit Suisse upgrade lifted Rolls-Royce, with the broker seeing evidence that the jet engine maker had solved problems with its Trent 1000 turbine.  Tui hit its lowest level since its 2014 Anglo-German merger on the back of last week’s profit warning and results on Tuesday, which showed a more than doubling of first-quarter operating losses.

"Japan’s SoftBank to invest €900m in Wirecard","German payments company prepares to reveal annual results amid accounting scandal","Japan’s SoftBank has agreed to invest €900m in Wirecard, the German digital payments company battling an accounting scandal.  SoftBank, a technology conglomerate that has become one of the sector’s biggest and most high-profile investors, will buy five-year Wirecard bonds that can convert into an equity stake in the Germany company. Under the terms of the proposed investment, the bonds will convert into a 5.6 per cent stake in Wirecard at a price of €130 a share, the German payments company said in a statement on Wednesday. Shares in Wirecard were up almost 9 per cent to €134 in early afternoon trading following the announcement. Wirecard added that the partnership with SoftBank would help it to expand further into Asian markets, including Japan and South Korea, and see the companies collaborate on data analytics and artificial intelligence. The planned investment comes just a day before Wirecard is due to present its annual results, which had been postponed due to the accounting issues in Asia. Shares in Wirecard have fallen sharply since late January, when the Financial Times first reported that a senior Wirecard executive in 2018 was suspected of using forged and backdated contracts in suspicious transactions.  The sale of the bonds by Wirecard needs to be approved at the German company’s annual shareholders’ meeting on June 18, it said in its statement, which did not disclose the coupon, or interest payments, that the bonds will carry.  A spokesperson for SoftBank said that the company intended to deploy Wirecard’s digital payments technology “at scale across new markets and sectors within SoftBank’s global technology portfolio.” SoftBank’s $100bn Vision Fund, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, has helped turn the Japanese group into one of the biggest tech investors. The agreement with Wirecard comes in the wake of several investments made by SoftBank’s Vision Fund in payments and banking space including its stakes in Paytm, an Indian digital payments group, and British banking start-up OakNorth.  While a person close to the Japanese group said its planned investment in Wirecard will complement its existing portfolio, it remains unclear whether it will be transferred to the Vision Fund. Credit Suisse advised SoftBank on the planned investment. The planned investment by SoftBank in Wirecard was first reported by Bloomberg. ","24.04.2019"
"Markets believe Donald Trump will get his rate cuts now","Expectations have collapsed as new fronts open up in US trade war","While Donald Trump has been demanding the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the US central bank has insisted it will continue to act independent of politics. Wall Street now expects the president will get his wish by another means: by harming the US economy to such an extent that the Fed will be forced to move. As the US trade wars have escalated — from the breakdown of talks with China in early May, to Mr Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico at the end of the month — traders have shredded their previous expectations for rates. The plan to impose escalating tariffs on Mexican goods unless the country agrees to help curb migration from Central America to the US caught investors by surprise and led several prominent forecasters to reappraise their outlook for monetary policy on Friday. “If the administration follows through on the proposed actions, we believe the adverse growth implications would prompt Fed easing,” Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, said in a note to clients that pencilled in Fed rate cuts in September and December.  “Even if a deal is quickly reached with Mexico, which seems plausible, the damage to business confidence could be lasting, with consequences that might still require a Fed response,” Mr Feroli warned.  James Sweeney, Credit Suisse’s chief economist, predicted that a cut could come as early as July. “This is no time for panic, but it might be time for some insurance,” he said.  The reaction in markets was swift and significant. The two-year Treasury yield — one of the measures of the US government bond market most sensitive to interest rates — tumbled 14 basis points to 1.92 per cent on Friday, its third-biggest one-day decline of the past decade.  That move capped a 34bp drop over the course of May, the largest monthly decline for the two-year yield since November 2008 at the depths of the financial crisis.  Policymakers at the central bank have said they still think economic growth is resilient enough to not have to trim rates, but Fed vice-chair Richard Clarida on Thursday vowed to be “nimble” and opened the possibility of easier policy if the economic outlook deteriorates further. Fed funds futures indicate that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will cut once or twice by the end of 2019, with the first move potentially coming in July. And some investors are placing bets on even more drastic action. The probability of four cuts before the end of 2019, which had been effectively zero since the start of the year, now stands at almost 6 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. In other words, it is almost as likely as the Fed’s current official projection that it will keep rates on pause; the market-implied probability that rates will be unchanged at the end of December is down to just 8 per cent from about 74 per cent at the start of the year.  Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the impact of tariffs on Mexico would be extensive. “The massive supply chain disruptions, significantly tighter financial conditions and depressed private sector confidence would amplify the direct tariff shock and increase the odds of a US downturn,” he said.  The Goldman Sachs analyst index — based on a monthly survey of the banks’ equity analysts’ assessments of business conditions in various sectors — dropped to a two-year low of 49.2 in May, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, as the trade dispute between the US and China escalated.","31.05.2019"
"Mexico narrowly avoids recession in second quarter","President Andrés Manuel López Obrador receives setback in quest for growth spurt","Mexico’s second-quarter growth registered just above zero, narrowly escaping market expectations of a technical recession but dealing a blow to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s promises to kick-start decades of disappointing growth.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.1 per cent from April to June, according to the state statistics institute Inegi, after a shock 0.2 per cent contraction in the first quarter.  Industrial activity was the surprise, coming in at zero after a poor performance in May. Services picked up, helping beat the market forecast of a 0.2 per cent contraction for GDP overall in the quarter. “We’ve woken up to good news,” the president told his daily early-morning news conference, at which he reiterated his forecast for 2 per cent growth in 2019. “Contrary to what some were forecasting, that we would fall and enter recession, fortunately the economy grew. The experts’ forecast didn’t work . . . Not everything is fixed but we’re doing very well economically,” he said. But Alonso Cervera at Credit Suisse wrote on Twitter that there was “little to celebrate. The economy has been stagnant for nearly a year. Accumulated growth in the first half was just 0.2 per cent.” The anaemic growth increases pressure on the Bank of Mexico to start reducing interest rates when its board meets on August 15, especially if the Fed goes ahead with its expected interest rate cut later on Wednesday. One board member, Gerardo Esquivel, who was appointed by Mr López Obrador, called for a cut at the last meeting in June.  Mr López Obrador says GDP data alone do not properly capture the development and wellbeing that his leftist nationalist government is delivering as he roots out institutionalised graft and boosts purchasing power in Latin America’s second-biggest economy through higher salaries and social programmes.  But his government was forced to unveil a $25bn stimulus package this week to try to rev up the economy. “The more concerning aspect of Mexico’s near-recession is that it is coming in the context of an expanding US economy and no external shocks,” said Luis Arcentales at Morgan Stanley. In a second-quarter report on state finances released on Tuesday, the finance ministry highlighted prudent debt management, higher salaries and low inflation and said the government was on course to hit its target of a 1 per cent primary surplus in 2019 — a goal that has reassured financial markets.  Nevertheless, the government has worried investors with some of its decisions, including the scrapping of a partially built $13bn airport and legal action by the state electricity company against what the government claims are exorbitant pipeline contracts.  Mr López Obrador said some experts had been trying to “create distrust” by “insisting on recession so much”. However, economists have repeatedly slashed their GDP forecasts since Mr López Obrador took office in December. The market consensus is now for just 0.9 per cent growth in 2019. Leading bank Citibanamex predicts just 0.2 per cent.  “(W)e still believe that risks are tilted slightly to the downside,” wrote Andrés Abadía at Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note to clients. Taking a red pen to its own estimate this month, the IMF highlighted that Mexican “investment remains weak and private consumption has slowed, reflecting policy uncertainty, weakening confidence and rising borrowing costs”. Mr López Obrador said the IMF should apologise for having cheered failed “neoliberal”, market-driven policies of the past 36 years that he is on a quest to overturn. The finance ministry has declined to give an updated growth outlook until the 2020 budget is presented on September 8. Mr López Obrador has complained that inflation — which directly affects people’s purchasing power — is not taken into account when measuring growth.  “[In the budget] we’re going to have to make forecasts of how we’re going to end the year in terms of growth, but we’ll also inform how we’ll finish in development, in wellbeing and . . . our projections for salaries, growth, inflation and the exchange rate,” he said this week.  Besides a lack of investment, the economy has been hammered by a 39 per cent drop in the number of jobs created in the first half, compared with the same period last year. Public spending has also got off to a slower-than-usual start as the López Obrador administration implements severe budget cuts designed to crack down on corruption and free up cash for flagship social programmes.  In its report on Tuesday night, the finance ministry said the government had spent 174.5bn pesos ($9.2bn) less than programmed, and tax revenues were below forecast. Arturo Herrera, who took over the finance minister post this month after the resignation of Carlos Urzúa, said Mexico was being buffeted by global headwinds including the US-China trade war.  He promised that the stimulus package, which included public-private partnerships in infrastructure and loans backed by the state development bank to boost consumption, would have an “immediate impact”.  But as Carlos Serrano, chief economist at BBVA in Mexico said: “Using development banks to try to stimulate demand is a film we’ve seen before in Latin America, and it doesn’t end well.”","31.07.2019"
"Big gains may not be over for the price of iron ore","Price of steelmaking ingredient could break $100 a tonne for the first time since 2014","© Reuters Shareholders in Fortescue Metals Group, the world’s fourth-biggest producer of iron ore, were pleasantly surprised this week when the board announced a special dividend of $1.3bn. The Perth-based group — along with rivals BHP and Rio Tinto — is generating large amounts of excess cash because of a sharp rise in the price of the steelmaking ingredient. Benchmark Australian ore has jumped almost 30 per cent to about $94 a tonne since January’s catastrophic dam rupture in Brazil — in which at least 230 people died — forced miner Vale to pull 90m tonnes of supply from the 1.5bn-tonne-a-year seaborne market. That price performance stands in contrast to other commodities. Copper is down 1.4 per cent over that period amid jitters about the outlook for global growth, while soyabeans are down 9 per cent.  Iron ore could also succumb to wider fears over growth but there are reasons to think the price could rise further, crossing $100 a tonne for the first time since 2014. At the start of the year most analysts were predicting a broadly balanced market — forecasts which were torn up in the wake of Vale’s Brumadinho disaster and revised further after a tropical storm battered the main iron-ore producing region of Western Australia in March. Port stocks in China, the world’s biggest consumer, have helped cushion the blow of supply shocks but warehouses could soon empty if domestic steel production continues its strong pace. Inventories in China are estimated to stand at about 134m tonnes but that figure is deceptive because much of the material has been purchased and is in transit. Analysts at Credit Suisse reckon there is only 40m-50m tonnes of freely available material at China’s docks. The bank estimates that will be used up by the autumn, at April’s rate of depletion. At that point, China’s vast steel industry will seek, with some urgency, cargoes in the spot market, driving prices up to $110 a tonne, or 17 per cent higher than current levels, the bank says. That would be good news for miners, of course. A 10 per cent rise in benchmark iron ore prices adds an extra $1.5bn to Rio’s operating earnings. Much depends on Vale, the world’s number one iron-ore supplier, and the regulatory environment in Brazil, which is grappling with the fallout from a second deadly dam burst in less than four years. While the company says it will now take about three years to meet an annual production target of 400m tonnes originally set for 2019, some of its suspended operations could come back on line sooner. Luciano Siani, Vale’s finance chief, predicted last week that 30m tonnes of export capacity from its Brucutu mine could return to the market in the “very short term”. If that does not happen — which is entirely possible given the local hostility toward Vale — an iron-ore price spike could be coming.","15.05.2019"
"Global stocks hold nerve as slowdown fears wane","Wall Street ticks higher in opening trade, bonds steadier after sharp rally last week","European stock markets recovered their poise on Monday, and investors moved back out of government bonds as fears of an imminent recession eased, indicating Friday’s fearful run had taken markets too far, too fast.    Reassurance came from better than expected business confidence data in Germany, which helped limit losses on Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax 30 to 0.2 per cent. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 was 0.4 per cent weaker after declining more than 1 per cent on Friday. The US stock market rose modestly, with the S&P 500 up 0.1 per cent overall.  “I don’t see a US recession as particularly likely,” said Janet Yellen, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong.  Ms Yellen described the “concern” in markets as “really overdone”, adding that with the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting committee expecting US economic growth of around 2 per cent, “that’s not a dangerous situation”.  Friday’s stocks sell-off came in reaction to disappointing data from Germany’s manufacturing sector, which sparked wider fears for global economic growth rates. Demand for the relative safety of government bonds pulled the yield on 10-year Bunds into negative territory, and led to investors demanding a premium to hold short-dated US debt over benchmark 10-year Treasuries. This inverted yield curve has often served as a harbinger of recession.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield inched lower on Monday, by 1 basis point to 2.4496 per cent on Monday as modest demand for the debt remained. The yield on US government debt maturing over three months crept lower, by just over 1 basis point to up to 2.4449 per cent.  Goldman Sachs said Friday’s German data had contributed to a “growth scare” on financial markets, but argued it amounted to a “major overreaction”. The US bank stuck by its opinion that weakness among German industry would be “manageable”. Charles Evans, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in comments on the sidelines of the Credit Suisse event in Hong Kong that while the flatter yield curve was “something to be mindful of”, the risk of a shock hitting the US economy was “not unusually high or low at the moment”. “I think the reports of economic activity in China slowing add to nervousness about the foreign growth outlook. I think against that is the fact that US growth has been pretty good and the fundamentals still are good, so we have to balance that,” said Mr Evans, who has tipped the US economy to grow 1.75 to 2 per cent this year. “Until things move more in one direction or another I’m pretty comfortable with where we are,” he added. Investors also moved back out of European government bonds on Monday, pulling their yields higher, after Friday’s ferocious rally pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year German Bund under zero for the first time since October 2016. It rose 1.5bp in Monday to minus 0.009 per cent.  The calmer showing came only after Friday’s trading pattern reverberated across Asia.  China and Japan’s main national equities indices declined more than 2 per cent each. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond dropped 1.4 bps to minus 0.09 per cent. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen, often a haven during periods of market stress, held near a six-week high at ¥109.77 per dollar. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, investors pulled $20.7bn out of equities last week and put $12.1bn into bonds, the biggest inflow since early 2018. Paul Brain, head of fixed income at Newton Investment Management in London, cautioned that for bond markets to “maintain these levels we will need confirmation that the economies are going to be weaker to the point where central banks have to change tack [from tighter monetary policy].” The more cautious tone struck by Fed policymakers at their meeting last week, when projections for further interest rate rises were abandoned, has added to the unease in equity markets.  Strategists at Citigroup said of the Fed that “to the degree that the US’s pause reflects a pure change in the Fed’s reaction function, this should help keep global financial conditions loose and support European reflation”, but “to the extent that it reflects ongoing concerns about US growth, this could be a warning sign”.

"‘Gender lens’ ETFs seek to promote workplace diversity","Demand is growing but some products suffer from lacklustre returns","“The business of business should not be about money,” wrote Anita Roddick, founder of ethical cosmetics company, The Body Shop. “It should be about responsibility.” It is a creed adopted increasingly by investors. Exchange traded funds that screen for a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria offer more opportunity for impact investment across the board, including for those seeking to boost diversity and inclusion in the workplace. ETFs with a “gender lens” are growing in size and number, driven by women’s increasing control of wealth and investment decisions, awareness campaigns such as #MeToo and sluggish progress on inclusivity in corporate leadership. Such an approach involves investing in gender-diverse businesses — that is, companies that include women in the founding team, leadership, management team or on the board — and backing companies that offer products or services that specifically benefit women. The overall amount invested in such ETFs remains small but is growing rapidly. Assets in gender lens investing (including mutual funds, equality bonds, as well as ETFs) grew by 85 per cent to $2.4bn in the 12 months to June 2018, according to Veris Wealth Partners. The firm predicts gender lens investment will grow to $20bn by 2023. “The old paradigm that you have to choose between impact and returns is simply not supported by the data,” says Ellen Remmer, a senior partner at The Philanthropic Initiative and campaigner for impact investing. I don’t like institutions that have a singular point of view, that suffer from groupthink’Barbara Byrne, investment banker Diverse leadership has long been shown to correlate with better performance. Last year, McKinsey expanded its 2015 study to show that among 1,000 companies globally, those in the top quartile of gender diversity in executive roles were 21 per cent more likely than the bottom quartile to outperform their industry’s average earnings. A 2016 Credit Suisse report also concluded that “the higher the percentage of women in top management, the greater the excess returns for shareholders”. However, the adage “correlation does not necessarily equal causation” applies here. No research has conclusively proven that diversity in itself causes superior performance. It could, for example, be that good corporate governance is the primary cause of higher returns, with boardroom diversity merely a concurrent outcome of the same policies. That argument does not deter proponents, who see diversity as giving companies an edge. Barbara Byrne, a private investor and formerly vice-chairman in investment banking at Barclays, says: “I don’t like institutions that have a singular point of view, that suffer from groupthink. I believe they put their organisations at greater risk. More diverse governance should mean that better questions and challenges are being asked at the board and strategy level.” Scrutiny of gender balance in the workplace is growing in line with women’s increased wealth and influence. Combined assets in female hands have been steadily rising: by 2020, it is predicted that women will hold $72tn, or 32 per cent, of global private wealth, according to the Boston Consulting Group. Opinions vary as to the bar that businesses must reach to be included in gender lens investment products. Many such ETFs use internal women in leadership (WIL) tracking indices but these do not necessarily reflect more than raw numbers. “It’s not enough to meet some base ratio,” says Ms Byrne. “I want to see women at the executive level running the business, not just supporting the business in, for example, human resources.” The Barclays Women in Leadership Total Return index, launched in 2014, was the first tradable benchmark that identified S&P 500 companies that had either a female chief executive or board composition that was at least 25 per cent female. This is a tougher measure than those adopted by similar products but some argue it should go further. “Indices should look beyond board composition and to a company’s total value chain, gender pay equality, its broader relationships with suppliers and customers and the impact it makes on women,” says Suzanne Biegel, founder of Catalyst at Large, a consultancy that also campaigns on this subject. Pax Ellevate Global Women’s Leadership Fund outperformed the MSCI World Index in the first quarter of this year, for example, but not all gender lens ETFs are star performers. State Street Global Advisors’ SHE, the largest diversity-focused ETF with about $296m under management, has marginally underperformed the S&P 500 over the three years it has been in existence. Sue Thompson, executive vice-president at SSGA, says the lag in performance of the SHE fund is because many large technology companies, which have driven much of the growth in the S&P, are excluded from its portfolio.  The fund also came under fire earlier this year as a report by Morningstar revealed that it had only actively backed two out of 10 shareholder resolutions aimed at improving diversity. Ms Thompson says she believes in “proactive engagement with the leadership of our portfolio companies” as a more effective approach than proxy voting. “This doesn’t need to be an either-or,” argues Ms Biegel. “An asset manager can both engage with the board behind the scenes and use its votes as a matter of public record.” Though still small in size, gender lens ETFs appear set to attract more capital as investors seek ways to change the world while performing their fiduciary duty. “The days when you threw your money over a brick wall and said, ‘Make as much money as you can’ have long gone,” says Ms Remmer. “Now everyone wants to know what’s beyond that wall.”","29.07.2019"
"A selection of the FT’s biggest stories and best reads every Friday","Kesewa Hennessy’s top reads this week: Brexit’s new borders; Hong Kong’s quiet protesters; Prince Harry v the press","What do you call a relentless tornado of news? A tornewsdo? A newsnado? Anyway, this week’s been one of them and Long Story Short is embracing it. UK prime minister Boris Johnson finally presented his “fair and reasonable” Brexit proposal, in doing so ripping up the Irish backstop. US president Donald Trump, facing impeachment proceedings, declared himself the victim of a “coup” (sorry, “COUP”). And Prince Harry decided to take on the press over its treatment of his wife, Meghan Markle. Less momentous maybe, but for Financial Times readers almost as compelling, KPMG demanded staff hand back their work mobiles to save costs. I hope you enjoy my pick of this week’s FT stories — plus a few from elsewhere you shouldn’t miss. And don’t forget to click here if you want to receive Long Story Short by email every Friday. 1. ‘To set up a new border is a bit ridiculous’ © Paul McErlane Boris Johnson published his “fair and reasonable” proposals for a Brexit deal. Key to the plan’s prospects, and the chances of agreeing a deal by October 31, is its handling of the Irish backstop — arrangements to avoid a return to a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The UK prime minister has excised the backstop altogether; instead there would be two borders: one down the Irish Sea and one across Ireland. Arthur Beesley, the FT’s Ireland correspondent, hears concerns from people working along the border about the disruption to business and to the Good Friday Agreement that ended sectarian conflict. Eamon Fitzpatrick (above), owner of a transport company that straddles the border, says new customs checks will make clients avoid the frontier:  “Then the next thing they quit coming to you. That’s the general rule of thumb.” 2. ‘We have less need for mobile phones . . . ’ Bill Michael, chairman of KPMG, has said that the firm will be taking a harsher approach to managing performance © FT montage / Bloomberg Would you care if your boss told you to hand back your work phone? Imagine life without that lump of black glass that ties you to the office 24/7. Tabby Kinder’s story on accountancy firm KPMG calling in staff mobiles to save costs is one of our most read of the week. Readers are divided between those who see the move as outrageous penny-pinching, those who see work mobiles as outdated — and others who say this will instil good discipline . . . in managers (Sample comment: “The couple times a year he does call me on it, it has been a bloody epic crisis”). Disappointingly, according to a KPMG spokesperson:  “This does not affect anyone whose role requires a high degree of travel or where they need to be contacted out of hours by their clients, customers or team.” 3. ‘Ideas, they’re bulletproof’ Behind the scenes of the Hong Kong protests This week the violence of Hong Kong’s demonstrations stepped up a level. For the first time in four months, on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, an anti-government protester was shot. The incident overshadowed China’s biggest-ever military parade (although, as our reporters explain, local residents were banned from watching). US politicians condemned the shooting. Hong Kong’s leaders invoked emergency powers to quash the protests. As the violence unfolded, FT reporters collected moving first-hand tales from professionals risking their jobs to help from behind the front line. One social worker supports people as they steel themselves to be arrested or beaten: “We just listen to their stories and we try to help them see what’s ahead of them so they can be more prepared.”  4. ‘This smacks of Harry on his own’ © Joe Cummings Prince Harry took on the UK press this week. As his wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, launched legal action against a newspaper following publication of a personal letter, the prince published a statement criticising “a ruthless campaign” against her. Alex Barker, the FT’s global media editor, looks at forces that have shaped the prince’s view of the press: the death of his mother, in flight from paparazzi, when he was a boy; and the treatment of Markle (the official statement acknowledging their relationship was a plea to cease the “racial undertone” of coverage). He also explains why the move is a risky one for the royal family’s “beaming rogue”. Prince Harry’s biographer says:  “It is the most extraordinary statement I have ever seen come from the royal household.” 5. ‘Work will never love you back’ © Getty “Work is predominantly a transactional affair.” It sounds basic. But Naomi Shragai, a psychotherapist and business consultant, says it’s a fact that’s easily forgotten. The confusion, she says, often arises from people trying to recreate at work the relationships they had with their parents as children. As Shragai illustrates with examples from her own practice, not only can this curb their creativity and decision-making abilities — it can also harm relationships with family and friends. One former client told her: “The risk is that family life disintegrates around you while your professional life heads gracefully forward until you reach a point where it’s too late to recognise what you’ve lost.”  Quick hits Other FT stories that have caught my eye this week

"Stocks to watch: M&S, Ocado, Renault, Daimler Cobham, AB InBev","Europe’s CO2 fines could erase carmaker profits, says Jefferies","Monday 14:00 BST Sellside stories ● Morgan Stanley restarted coverage of Ocado and Marks and Spencer with “equal weight” ratings, having advised M&S on the companies’ now-complete formation of a UK grocery delivery partnership. While investors had underestimated the scale of change under way at M&S, the operational risks taken on via the Ocado venture would do little to lift scepticism around its turnround potential, Morgan Stanley said.    “We think the logic of partnering with Ocado is compelling, but only on the assumption that M&S needs to compete in the online food channel, and we remain unconvinced by that. We believe that the switch from Waitrose to M&S supply next year carries significant risk, and do not forecast the joint venture hitting its contractually embedded growth targets . . . Whilst it has been clear all along that any M&S turnaround would take several years, we had anticipated investors being well remunerated for their patience. The recent 40 per cent dividend cut, however, undermines that thesis and also raises questions as to whether the board anticipates cash flows weakening significantly.”Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley set a 230p target on M&S. “There is a chance that some ‘green shoots’ begin to emerge in 2020, but we think investor scepticism on M&S is such that the shoots will need to develop almost into fully grown trees before the market will be prepared to price them in,” it said. For Ocado, Morgan Stanley’s £13.20 price target included 100p for the M&S joint venture. The broker also highlighted that if, as expected, the partnership does not reach growth targets, Ocado would be allowed to make its technology available to other UK food retailers.  ● Jefferies downgraded Daimler and Renault to “underperform”, from “hold” and “buy” respectively as part of a review of EU emissions regulations due to come into force next year. “EU CO2 compliance feels a bit like Brexit these days,” said Jefferies. “After the initial lull and belief that, surely, there is a solution, reason will prevail and decision makers have a plan, deadlines approach and anxiety mounts.” A worst-case scenario where CO2 emissions remained at 2018 levels would cost the industry €32bn in fines for 2021 alone, or 9 per cent of estimated revenue from EU new car sales and more than twice the estimated earnings, said Jefferies. To make sales compliant by next year, automakers needed to change their production mix dramatically by no later than the third quarter and investors would likely be left in the dark about progress they had made, Jefferies said. It also forecast that consumer prices would need to increase by between 8 and 10 per cent in 2020 to cover the extra costs.  “Should compliance not be achieved, we think CO2 regulation contains all the ingredients of a policy crisis, pitting industry against regulators and states,” Jefferies said.  Yet consensus forecasts still assume a 6 per cent improvement in trading performance for the automakers next year, “which seems overly optimistic given Europe’s CO2 challenges and the state of other global markets”, said the broker. Its own 2020 “recession scenario” for the industry led Jefferies to cut earnings estimates by as much as 25 per cent below market expectations.  Daimler’s balance sheet “is not fit to face a downturn” and the company might need fresh capital, Jefferies said. Structurally lower profitability and cash conversion than peers were compounded by excess dividend payments, justifying a share price target of €40, it said. On Renault, Jefferies worried that the group’s budget Dacia brand was accounting for a quarter of EU volumes. “Since the brand apparently generates above-group-average margins from price-sensitive private buyers, making Dacia compliant through electrification or other CO2 compliant content could disproportionately hurt profitability,” said the broker, which set a €1.4 target price. ● Barclays downgraded Cobham from “overweight” to “equal-weight” with a 165p target price. Its cut followed Jamie Pike, Cobham’s chairman, saying that the aerospace engineer was “actively looking for other offers” to trump a 165p all-cash takeover bid from Advent International. BAE Systems could match Advent’s takeover price and deliver an acceptable return but was unlikely to be interested, given it sold US electronics assets to Cobham during the 2000s, Barclays said. It also concluded that a Meggitt purchase of Cobham would dilute earnings per share in the first year as well as requiring net debt to rise to 2.2 times earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation, which would be unattractive compared with peers. A counterbid from a private equity fund looked more plausible, it said.  ● In brief: AB InBev raised to “hold” at Jefferies; ASTM cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Aperam cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; ArcelorMittal cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Basilea raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Bureau Veritas cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Carrefour cut to “underperform” at Bernstein; Centrica cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Deutsche Boerse rated new “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; DiaSorin cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Endesa raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Ferrexpo cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Fuchs Petrolub cut to “hold” at HSBC; Gerresheimer raised to “buy” at HSBC; IAG raised to “hold” at HSBC; Iberdrola raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Intertek cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Kloeckner raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Metro Bank raised to “neutral” at Citigroup; Outokumpu cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Puma raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Renault cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; SSAB cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Safilo raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Shearwater rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Unite rated new “overweight” at Barclays.

"3M to buy wound-care product maker Acelity in $6.7bn deal","Industrial group trims share repurchase programme as a result of transaction","3M on Thursday said it would acquire a maker of wound care products for roughly $6.7bn, including net debt, even as the industrial group last month announced plans to shed jobs as part of a restructuring. The Minnesota-based company will finance the transaction with a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of new debt. The conglomerate behind everything from Post-it notes to industrial products agreed to buy Acelity and its KCI subsidiaries — which make a broad range of wound care products. 3M is buying the group from a consortium of funds advised by buyout group Apax Partners alongside affiliates of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board.  Acelity, which has disposed of non-core assets, including the $2.9bn sale of LifeCell to Allergan in 2017, generated 2018 revenues of $1.5bn.  “Acelity is a recognised leading provider of advanced wound care technologies and solutions and an excellent complement to our healthcare business,” said Mike Roman, 3M chief executive.  The consortium took the business then known as Kinetic private in a $6.5bn deal in 2011. It changed its name to Acelity in 2014 and a year later it looked to list. However, shareholders decided against the move due to market conditions at the time, according to a person familiar with the move. Acelity, which has grown partly through acquisitions, was looking to list again as recently as last month but 3M came up with a competitive offer in the meantime, people with knowledge of the situation said.  Apax is expected to make more than three times its original investment, according to a person familiar with the deal. 3M expects the deal to be dilutive to earnings per share by 35 cents in the first 12 months following the completion of the deal, including transaction costs. Excluding one-time transaction costs, 3M expects the deal to be accretive to earnings per share by 25 cents over the same period. As a result of the deal, 3M scaled back its share buyback programme to between $1bn to $1.5bn, down from $2bn to $4bn.  3M shares fell 1 per cent to $184 in pre-market trade.  The news of the acquisition comes after 3M last month said it would shed 2,000 jobs globally as part of a restructuring and reduced its full-year earnings guidance. The company recently realigned its portfolio to four business groups from five, in its efforts to drive productivity, reduce costs and boost cash flow. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second half of the year.  Credit Suisse acted as financial adviser to 3M. Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP acted as legal counsel to 3M.","02.05.2019"
"IT group Softcat sees sales up a fifth on cloud demand","Profits also grow vigorously with FTSE 250 group benefiting from tougher data rules","Softcat’s run of growth remained intact as demand for its key hybrid cloud service pushed the IT group’s first-half sales up by a fifth.
 Profit rose 41 per cent for the UK-based services provider, with revenues bouncing 21 per cent to £434m, the FTSE 250 group said on Tuesday. Pre-tax profit for the six months through January rose to £34m, enough to award shareholders a dividend of 4.5p per share, up from 3.3p. Softcat’s share price rose 5.7 per cent on Tuesday. Chief executive Graeme Watt emphasised the role “additional market share gains” played in the success: “We added more than 600 new customers in the period while gross profit per customer grew by almost 20 per cent.”  Demand in hybrid cloud computing, a mixture of private and public cloud services, helped Softcat extend its run of year-on-year profit growth for a tenth consecutive year. Stricter data protection requirements also helped the group cross the line, as businesses search for more innovative security solutions. Customer numbers grew 6.5 per cent, trailing slightly behind the 6.7 per cent growth for the same period last year.  Mr Watt said the board expects a full year profit “marginally ahead of previous expectations.”  Increasing business with existing customers is a “strategic target” of the group as it saw an 18.7 per cent jump in gross profit per customer.  Tuesday’s announcement follows a Credit Suisse upgrade in January that projected Softcat’s company earnings per share to rise 4 per cent in 2019 and by 5 per cent in 2020 after profits appeared “materially” ahead of expectations.","19.03.2019"
"Beyond Meat looks to raise up to $240m in upsized IPO","Plant-based meat substitute company could be worth $1.5bn after strong investor interest","Beyond Meat, the plant-based meat substitute company preparing to float later this week, has raised the size and price range of its offering, giving it a potential valuation of $1.5bn.  The California-based group, which counts Bill Gates among its backers, said it would sell 9.6m shares at $23 to $25 a share, raising up to $240m in its initial public offering, according to a SEC filing. The amount the company now plans to raise is 30 per cent higher than its previous estimate of $184m, through an offering of 8.75m shares at $19-$21 a piece that would have given an initial market value for the company of $1.2bn. Several of the most high-profile, private Silicon Valley technology companies are going public. The We Company, parent of the shared office space provider WeWork, disclosed on Monday it had filed paperwork for an IPO. Uber is talking to investors this week ahead of its own listing. Lyft and Pinterest have already joined the public markets.  Beyond Meat’s flotation comes as interest in plant-based meat substitutes is increasing. Many consumers in developed markets are opting to eat less meat or becoming vegan or vegetarian, citing environmental and health concerns. And a new generation of products go beyond previous vegetarian options, mimicking the taste, texture and smell of real meat. Rather than mushing vegetables together, Beyond Meat analysed the molecular structure of meat and recreated it using amino acids, lipids, minerals and vitamins extracted from plants. Beyond Meat’s burger, which accounted for 70 per cent of its revenue last year, is made primarily out of yellow peas and uses beet juice to mimic the “bleeding” of a meat burger. The company’s portfolio also includes plant-based substitutes for sausage and chicken. The big question is how long the current consumer interest in the genre would last, said Justin Sherrard, global animal protein strategist at Rabobank. “Is this structural,” he said, “or are consumers going to shift to something else?” Beyond Meat plans to use the proceeds from its IPO to invest in new manufacturing facilities and R&D, stepping up competition with rival Impossible Foods, which is also raising money to increase production capacity. 
 Impossible teamed up with Burger King to trial the “Impossible Whopper” this month in St Louis, Missouri, the heart of beef and barbecue country. José Cil, chief executive of Restaurant Brands International, the Burger King owner, told analysts that it was preparing more test markets followed by a nationwide launch at the end of this year. Beyond Meat’s revenue in 2018 was $87.9m, up from $32.6m in 2017 with net losses flat at around $30m in both years.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse are lead underwriters on the offering.

 Now to today’s main event . . .
  You may have noticed that Stephen Schwarzman is blanketing the media at the moment. Why? Well, it’s not that the billionaire investor has decided to retreat from his tight links and strong backing of US president Donald Trump, who counts him as an important adviser. The co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Blackstone Group, the world’s most powerful alternative money manager, instead has come out with a new book called What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence. In it, Schwarzman seeks to offer management advice through the lens of a career that has seen him build a personal fortune of $18bn. That is the context for this memorable Lunch with the FT, where Schwarzman sits down with FT editor-in-chief Lionel Barber for a conversation that touches on everything from risk-taking to philanthropy as well as his thoughts on taxes and wages (for both the rich and the not-so rich).  We won’t spoil the whole piece. Lionel also offers an alternative title for the book, which DD thinks cuts to the core of what Schwarzman is all about. We have chosen a couple of top quotes from Schwarzman here: On politics: “The politics of anger and free things is a powerful potential elector . . . Vietnam was about one issue. This is much more intense, much more far-reaching.”

On China: “China has enjoyed the most stunning transformation in the past 40 years of any country, most probably, in world history. It did it through a variety of mechanisms that are not consistent with the rules and regulations of the developed world.”

On stamina (or succession plans): “I don’t think I’ll ever retire. My grandfather never did.”

WeBank: how Wall Street’s top executives wooed WeWork When Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank soured on WeWork chief executive Adam Neumann, the 40-year-old co-founder turned to one of Wall Street’s top bankers for advice this weekend: Jamie Dimon. Neumann and Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, met in New York this weekend as the WeWork chief tries to see off the greatest crisis he has been faced with since he founded the lossmaking property group nine years ago. SoftBank is pushing for Neumann to step down as chief executive, setting up a high-wattage board meeting that could forever alter the company. Neumann’s turn to Dimon underlines the depths Wall Street has gone to secure a relationship with the WeWork co-founder. And it has not just been JPMorgan that has fallen over itself to woo Neumann and his company. There are some 31 underwriters on the company’s now-stalled IPO, including heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and UBS.  Now it is the reputation of these banks that are at risk of being tainted. According to pitch books reviewed by DD and interviews with people briefed on the process, IPO bankers dangled potential valuations even higher than the $47bn price tag Mr Son’s last investment put on the company. JPMorgan told WeWork executives the company could be worth between $46bn and $63bn in the listing. Goldman pegged the equity at between $61bn and $96bn. Morgan Stanley estimated WeWork’s valuation at between $43bn and $104bn in a presentation in 2018, though a pitch for the IPO set it at a more modest $18bn-$52bn.  DD’s Eric Platt and James Fontanella-Khan worked with the FT’s Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Laura Noonan to piece together the who’s who of the cast involved in WeWork across Wall Street. The list includes JPMorgan vice-chairman Noah Wintroub, Goldman chief executive David Solomon and partner Kim Posnett, as well as Skadden partner Ryan Dzierniejko. And that’s before two noted crisis communications firms were called in to help assist the company and Neumann. Internally, one name worth knowing is Artie Minson
, the group’s finance chief. While the pressure is on Neumann to step down from his role as chief executive, SoftBank is also facing heat from top executives at the company who are baulking at taking on loans to take a huge personal bet on the $97bn Vision Fund. After all, the investments that drove the Vision Fund up are now dragging it down. For more on WeWork and SoftBank read this note by our Lex column. Will Elliott push AT&T to offload HBO?  HBO, the premium US cable channel, had a great night at the Emmy awards on Sunday night. It scored the most wins of any network or platform thanks to hits such as Game of Thrones and Chernobyl. That doesn’t mean life is about to get any easier though for its owner AT&T, which acquired the channel as part of its deal for Time Warner. AT&T, as DD readers know, is facing a serious challenge from activist investor Elliott Management, which is pushing for a number of changes to generate shareholder returns. The FT’s Anna Nicolaou and James Fontanella-Khan look at the challenges the telecom and media group faces and what the aggressive activist hedge fund wants in this piece. Here are some highlights: Elliott argues that AT&T is bloated after making too many pricey acquisitions

Elliott views everything at AT&T as potentially up for sale including HBO and DirecTV


Elliott is sceptical of the plan for HBO Max, which is AT&T’s streaming response to Netflix


Elliott wants AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson to quit soon (and they also don’t like John Stankey, who is Stephenson’s favourite to succeed him)

Elliott has identified John Donovan, who was head of AT&T’s communications division before departing last month in a management shake-up, as a better CEO replacement

 AT&T’s response to this is that they are actually doing much better than Elliott gives them credit for. In a few points: AT&T believes that its acquisitions make it a much more valuable company than just a telecom provider

AT&T thinks that HBO is integral to its future and while DirecTv is not as great as it could be it still generates a lot of cash and can be integrated with the rest of WarnerMedia


AT&T believes that people are going to spend more and more of their day watching premium content in the future so HBO Max is core to its strategy.

Stephenson has firmly defended Stankey. In the past when talking about the AT&T veteran the current CEO said: “If you’re going to go find somebody to run a big communication company, John Stankey would have to be on your shortlist for that.”

 Change is inevitable. And somewhere in Medialand DD has to imagine HBO’s former boss Richard Plepler,below, is having a hearty laugh at the situation at AT&T.  Elsewhere, DD’s Ortenca Aliaj and Lindsay Fortado broke the news at the weekend that Elliott was preparing to raise as much as $5bn in its latest funding round. Get the details over why Elliott is building its war chest here. Job moves Rhône Group, the private equity firm, has rehired John Bolton as a senior adviser. Bolton was most recently Donald Trump’s national security adviser. Houlihan Lokey has hired Shea Goggin as a managing director to run its US private funds group from Chicago. He joins from UBS.

"Stocks to watch: GVC, Vodafone, Iliad, TalkTalk, Saga, Just Eat","Avoid the value traps in the telecoms sector, says Exane","Friday 12:30 GMT What’s happening ● GVC dropped to its lowest in nearly three years on news that Kenny Alexander, the Ladbrokes owner’s chief executive, and chairman Lee Feldman both sold more than three-quarters of their shareholdings. The directors sold the stock at 666p a share, netting around £13.7m for Mr Alexander and £6m for Mr Feldman.  In a statement, Mr Alexander said he was fully committed to the business for the long term and had a “current plan that will take three years to accomplish”. The sales follow speculation around tighter regulation of online wagers, which have contributed to GVC halving in value since August.  “There is rarely a good time to sell shares as it is almost always seen as a negative signal . . . We flag that this selling comes after a period of significant derating for both GVC and the sector and comes so soon after Mr Alexander’s bullish outlook at full-year results on Tuesday.”Barclays Sellside stories ● Exane BNP Paribas cut Vodafone to “neutral” and downgraded Iliad, the French mobile telecoms group, to “underperform” as part of a sector review.  Tough times for the telecoms operators are likely to continue, with mobile service revenues having continued to deteriorate last year and fixed revenue declining for the first year since 2015, said Exane. “Despite the [share price] underperformance of the last few years we still struggle to see much value in the sector, and caution that many of the stocks in our coverage remain value traps with overly bullish medium-term consensus estimates,” it said. Earnings upgrades, and not valuation, will remain the most important driver for returns among telecoms stocks in the short term, Exane said. It saw Finnish operators Elisa and DNA as top picks in the sector thanks to their high consumer satisfaction rates in an oligopolistic market, and argued that Tele2 of Sweden would benefit from a quality-conscious consumer base. Iliad was “an outright short” because two years of intense competition in France had eroded its niche of simple low-cost offers, while expansion into Italy and Ireland muddied the investment story, Exane said. It also advised selling BT, TalkTalk and Liberty Global based largely on deteriorating brand values in the UK. On Vodafone, Exane said the 2020 dividend was unlikely to be covered by cash post spectrum licence costs and saw signs of a slowdown in Germany, the group’s biggest market. ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded Saga, the over-50s travel agent and insurance group, to “underweight” from “neutral” on competition worries. With Saga due to take on debt over the next two years to fund two new cruise ships, leverage will peak in 2021 and “a further deterioration in market conditions could start to pose questions about dividend sustainability”, said the broker, which set a 120p price target.  “Saga, in our view, faces margin pressure across its broking business, as competitive conditions continue to weigh on industry profitability. Several of the larger UK motor players have reported in the past week and all have described industry pricing that is failing to keep pace with claims inflation. Given that Saga is seeking to return to policy growth after many years of declines, this is an unhelpful backdrop, we believe, while travel may also be seeing pressure due to Brexit uncertainty.”JPMorgan ● In brief: ACS cut to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; Azimut raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Baloise cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Bawag upgraded to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Bunzl downgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Close Brothers rated new “sell” at Investec; Covestro cut to “hold” at HSBC and raised to “overweight” at Barclays; Europcar downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Ferrexpo cut to “hold” at Investec; ISS cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Inwit upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays; Just Eat cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Norwegian Air Shuttle upgraded to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Ontex raised to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Rio Tinto raised to “buy” at Investec; SIG upgraded to “buy” at Goodbody; Sabadell cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Scout24 cut to “hold” at Liberum; Sixt rated new “neutral” at UBS.

"European banks wield axe after bleak fourth quarter","Clients pulled money as markets were roiled by trade wars, growth concerns and Brexit","One of the most brutal trading quarters in memory has sparked another round of soul-searching at Europe’s few remaining investment banks, with some concluding the only option is to wield the axe again. The seven largest traders in the region reported sharp declines in markets revenues in the final period of 2018, falling an average 19 per cent, three times more than the aggregate 6 per cent drop at US rivals, according to data from Citigroup. The results were also marred by eye-watering one-off losses from deals and trades gone bad. While Barclays again stood out from the crowd by reporting the least-bad results on Thursday — giving chief executive Jes Staley a vital boost in his battle with an activist investor — the German and French national champions were particularly badly hit, forcing new rounds of cost and job cuts. Executives blamed a variety of reasons, particularly “extreme” decade-low levels of activity as clients pulled their money to the sidelines while markets were roiled by President Donald Trump’s trade wars and government shutdown, widespread economic growth concerns and Brexit. But the performance underlined their dwindling ability to compete with a resurgent Wall Street. “The original sin for European banks is that their home market is small and fragmented compared to the US,” said Ronit Ghose, an analyst at Citi. They have “failed to consistently compete in US capital markets and most shareholders are no longer willing to support strategies that prioritise growth”. France’s two largest banks, BNP Paribas and Société Générale, slashed their financial targets and promised to cut a combined €850m of costs from their investment banks. Just a year ago, both were talking about becoming “top players” in global markets and taking market share back from the Americans.  The scale of the problems at BNP’s global markets division shocked the market. It posted a €225m loss in the quarter after revenue fell 40 per cent. The headline was a 70 per cent plunge in equity trading, a traditional strength of the bank, and it made an $80m loss on a single derivative trade linked to the S&P 500 index. It is also shutting its shortlived proprietary trading division. “It’s not a question of waiting on the cycle in Europe, it’s more about the structural changes in the business model,” SocGen chief executive Frédéric Oudéa said after the results. 
 Germany’s Deutsche Bank also had another bleak quarter. Bond trading revenue slid 23 per cent, which combined with a 47 per cent decline in debt origination resulted in a €303m pre-tax loss for the investment bank. Several of its biggest shareholders subsequently called for deeper cuts to its perennially lossmaking US unit, the Financial Times reported last week.
 A top Swiss bank executive commented that: “European banks long-ago lost their foothold in the US, which has always been the core investment banking market, and without that scale business they will always struggle to be profitable.” Barclays, the last bank holding the line in investment banking, fared better. Revenues at its fixed-income trading operation fell 6 per cent compared with double-digit declines at European and US rivals. Its equities trading unit posted a 3.4 per cent increase, the only one in the region to record a positive result.  Jefferies banks analyst Joseph Dickerson said Barclays appeared to be managing risk more prudently than in the past, avoiding some of the “blow ups” that hurt its rivals. However, Barclays’ equities performance paled when compared with double-digit increases at Citigroup, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Investors were not impressed. The shares were flat on the day and it still trades at 60 per cent of the book value of its assets. Still, the chief executive said the quarter was more evidence his turnround was working, helping him fend off activist Edward Bramson, who is trying to muscle his way on to the board and force the group to scale back its securities unit. “If you’re a trader at BlackRock and you want to do a three-year interest rate swap, you’re going to write it with someone you’re pretty sure is going to be here three years from now,” Mr Staley said in an interview. “Our commitment to investment banking, perhaps the strongest of any European bank, is beginning to resonate.” “The capital market is very thin in Europe . . . [but] in the US it’s grown,” he added. “We happen to have one of the largest US investment banks. And that is a competitive advantage we want to preserve.”  Switzerland’s UBS and Credit Suisse suffered the worst drops in investment banking revenue — 12 per cent and 21 per cent respectively — but both have drastically shrunk their trading divisions in favour of wealth management, insulating earnings. Credit Suisse lost $60m after it hung on too long to shares it had underwritten for Canada Goose, which plunged after the down-jacket maker got caught up in a trade dispute with China. Separately, its Asian fixed-income revenues fell 91 per cent. “We are not making excuses here, it was a tough quarter . . . not exactly a fun moment,” Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam said. However, “the primary story about our trading business is to reduce the potential losses in bad markets.” “Nobody any more debates that the sales and trading revenue pool, globally, is in structural decline,” he added. “If you try to grow in this shrinking industry, your total revenue will go down.” After another humbling quarter, European banks appear to be in another period of retrenchment, said Nick Watts, an analyst at Redburn who used to work for Barclays. “However, they have a tendency to dip their toes back in the water as soon as market conditions look better and therein lies the problem: their inconsistent strategy around investment banking.”","22.02.2019"
"Ken Costa looks to Saudi Arabia for next big deal ","Former Lazard banker with strong Gulf links is not ready to retire just yet ","When UK chancellor Philip Hammond flew to Saudi Arabia this month to discuss business relations between the two nations, he was accompanied by one of the City’s long-standing veterans, Ken Costa. Describing himself as a “M&A junkie”, Mr Costa has become involved in what could be one of the biggest deals of the century. On the agenda in Jeddah was London’s role in a potential international flotation of state oil company Saudi Aramco. Saudi officials have said this could now take place in late 2020 or early 2021, after postponing a stock market listing last year when it failed to generate the desired $2tn valuation, alongside concerns around legal exposure. But Mr Costa, who is the government’s special envoy to Saudi Arabia, is more optimistic, saying it could be fast-tracked to earlier next year, ahead of the country’s hosting of the G20 meetings in November. “If there is an international branch of the listing, the UK will be the place of choice for a global offering,” he said. At 69, the South African banker is showing no signs of slowing down. After a 30-year career in the City, with stints at UBS and as the head of Lazard International, Mr Costa joined boutique wealth adviser Alvarium in 2018, where his role is to help arrange deals for the next generation of super-rich investors. “Like all good investment bankers, you need to reinvent yourself,” he said. Hopping on to a boutique board is in vogue in the wealth management industry. Andrew Formica, head of Jupiter Asset Management, joined the board of boutique adviser Artorius Wealth last year after leaving Janus Henderson. Juerg Zeltner, who previously ran UBS’s wealth management business, was in May named head of KBL European Private Bankers, a collection of boutique brands.  There are now more than 168,000 so-called ultra-high net worth individuals globally with at least $30m in investable assets, according to a Capgemini report — and advisers are scrambling to serve them. While global banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse claim they can better cater to the super-wealthy as they offer a range of products and investment banking services, boutique rivals disagree. Mr Costa said there was an “inherent conflict” in larger banks providing wealth management, as the wealth arms and investment banking arms were incentivised to compete with each other. “The big wealth managers of the world are struggling, and the reason that they’re struggling is that there’s huge pressure on fees,” he added, referring to increasing regulation that has been introduced in part to avoid money laundering and tax evasion among the super-rich. There is also a growing trend for wealthy families to invest in direct private equity deals as they chase returns in a low interest rate era. Mr Costa recently advised a handful of families on the purchase of four Grange Hotels in London for £1bn. The banker has strong links to the Gulf. One of Alvaruim’s shareholders is family office Dilmun, which is believed to be owned by Sheikh Jassim bin Abdul Aziz Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family. A longtime Conservative party donor, Mr Costa pointed out that a recent £10,000 donation to leadership contender Jeremy Hunt was made in a personal capacity after media group BuzzFeed said it would “raise questions” about his Saudi links. Mr Costa said relations with Saudi Arabia had “clearly been strained” since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s Turkish embassy last year, which he referred to as “horrendous”; as well as the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. But he added that the UK government cannot just cut contact with a long-term trading partner: “I believe it is right to work behind the scenes to help the [Saudi] modernisation programme.” His knowledge of Gulf investors gives him an insight into the uncertainty Brexit has created around investment into the UK: “I know for certain in the Gulf there are big investors holding back right now,” he noted. The most painful moment of his career, he said, came after he left his position as chairman of Lazard International in 2011. With other bankers, he set up a private equity fund called DMC Partners that sought to raise $2bn to invest in emerging markets. But the fund was forced to close in 2014 after failing to raise enough money. “The fact of the matter is that our judgment on the market was wrong,” said Mr Costa. “That was very painful; it still is.” Mr Costa has an unusual side career — he has long been a senior figure in the evangelical Christian scene and is the Emeritus chairman of Alpha, the Christian charity that runs the Alpha course. He has written three religious books, which are distributed through churches around the world, and makes motivational videos at godatwork.org.uk, whose stated mission is to help “propel you to be an agent of the kingdom of God in your workplace”.  Mr Costa said his latest incarnation as an adviser to millennials fitted with his Christian world view. Millennials, he said, were not “feckless youths eating avocados” but rather a “caring and sharing” generation. “I believe that I’ve got a call to being in this place, and I love working with people, and I love making deals,” he said. “So, that energises me at a time when golf doesn’t.”","19.07.2019"
"Asian equities: King Kong","The Japanese market need not fall too far behind Hong Kong’s","Funny how soaring equity prices take one’s mind off things. Not so long ago portfolio managers regularly surveyed by Bank of America mostly feared a trade war between the US and China. Not much progress has been made. But no news is good news. Chinese shares have sharply rebounded, partly on promises of economic stimulus from Beijing, partly on hope for a resolution with the US. Hong Kong’s market wins in two ways, benefiting from better sentiment towards China and the US. Japan, though, has lost out. This week Hong Kong’s market value has surpassed that of Japan, for the first time in about four years. Any bet taken clearly depends on the mainland, too. Indeed, even as mainland and Hong Kong share prices dipped sharply during 2018, there is evidence, according to Credit Suisse, that foreign investors were buying. They were closing out an underweight position in China — at one point nearly 20 per cent below the benchmark MSCI Asia. Meanwhile, foreign outflows from Japan last year were a record $118bn. This shift away from Japan has nothing to do with valuation. Stocks there have rarely been cheaper, relative to other world markets or even to all of Asia Pacific. The Japan MSCI price-to-earnings ratio at 12.5 times is 5 per cent below that of its regional index, which is the most for a decade
. 
 There may be another reason for Japan’s laggard status. Some asset allocators have voiced fears to their portfolio managers that stock prices there are less driven by fundamentals than ever, as the Bank of Japan and pension funds there use index exchange traded funds. Passive funds account for more than 70 per cent of assets under management in Japan. Though Japan Inc has enjoyed record high profitability in recent years, it loses out to China as a whole no matter what. More mainland shares join the China and Asian indices each year.  China’s economic potential today clearly exceeds Japan’s. But any mismatch between the Hong Kong and Japanese market should be priced in by now. That suggests Japan need not fall too far behind its Asian neighbour Hong Kong.

"China accused of Telegram attacks","CrowdStrike surges, Lyft and Uber team up on driver status, Samsung’s 292in TV","FT subscribers can click here to receive #techFT every day by email. This sounds like a case for CrowdStrike. Our team in China reports the founder of Telegram has claimed that China was behind a massive hacking attack on the encrypted messaging app being used by Hong Kong demonstrators to organise protests against the territory’s planned extradition bill. Pavel Durov's comments on the denial-of-service attacks came as Hong Kong police arrested a man identified as the administrator of one of the Telegram groups being used by protesters. The demonstrations erupted into violence on Wednesday, with at least 72 people injured. Encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram have become the digital underground channels for protests around the world. It was banned in Iran last month, just a month after Russia blocked the service. Separately, shares in CrowdStrike, the cyber security company that uncovered Russian hackers inside the servers of the US Democratic National Committee, closed up more than 70 per cent, on the first day of trading for the latest Silicon Valley IPO. The Internet of (Four) Things 1. Uber and Lyft are in union on driver status
The ride-hailing services are setting aside their rivalry to unite against a threat to their business models: the prospect that their drivers must be treated as employees. On Wednesday, top executives published a joint opinion article in the San Francisco Chronicle proposing concessions in exchange for continuing to classify their drivers as independent contractors. 2. Fortnite's Houseparty
Does the ridiculously popular Fortnite battle-royale online game have aspirations to be a big social network? It already is one, in some respects, with its more than 200m registered players, and it has just bought Houseparty, a video-chat app, for an undisclosed sum. Houseparty said the deal would allow it to “help even more people connect with their friends, family, and peers”. 3. Alibaba files for HK listing
According to Bloomberg, the Chinese ecommerce group has filed confidentially for a Hong Kong listing, in what would potentially be the city’s biggest share sale since 2010. The move to add to its US listing had been expected, but Alibaba has kept its application private and is reported to have picked China International Capital and Credit Suisse as lead banks.  4. Sky and BBC take on streamers
The BBC and Sky are both stepping up their efforts to counter the growing threat posed by the video streaming services of Netflix and Amazon in Europe. Sky, the European pay-TV and broadband provider that was bought by Comcast for just over £30bn last year, said it would more than double its spending on original programmes to more than £1bn a year by 2024. The BBC aims to transform its iPlayer from a catch-up service to a streaming platform in its own right, by extending the time limit on programme availability from a month to a year.

"Beyond Meat more than doubles in trading debut","Vegan start-up shares issued at $25 each surge to a high of nearly $73","Shares in California-based Beyond Meat more than doubled on their debut on Nasdaq on Thursday, as investors scrambled to get exposure to the fast-growing sector of plant-based food. The group’s shares closed at $65.75 in New York after opening at $46 and surging as high as $72.95, and triggering a brief halt in the morning session due to the volatility. The company, which is the first plant-based food group to list on a leading exchange, priced its initial public offering late on Wednesday at $25 a share, raising $240.6m. Ethan Brown, founder and chief executive of Beyond Meat said that the company’s products would enable people to continue to consume “meat” but he also wanted to change agriculture. Beyond Meat could “restructure agriculture to drive efficiency, but more fundamentally, do it in a way that’s better for the human body and better for the earth,” he said. Beyond Meat’s flotation comes at a time when appetite for plant-based meat substitutes is growing. Consumers in developed markets are opting to eat less meat or turning to vegan or vegetarian foods, citing environmental and health concerns. Mr Brown said he had realised that agriculture and food could benefit from science and technology. “[Livestock] has huge health implications for humans and the environment and animal welfare in general, yet we weren’t spending any money on it,” he said. “We were just making an assumption that it was immovable and we had to use animals.” New spins on traditional vegetarian options are mimicking the taste, texture and smell of meat to attract meat-eating consumers. Beyond Meat attempts to imitate the structure provided by animal muscle by using amino acids, lipids, minerals and vitamins extracted from plants. Beyond Meat’s burger, which accounted for 70 per cent of its revenue last year, is made primarily out of yellow peas and uses beet juice to mimic the “bleeding” of a meat burger. The company’s menu of products also includes plant-based substitutes for sausage, chicken and beef. It said it would use the proceeds from its IPO to invest in new manufacturing facilities and R&D, stepping up competition with rival Impossible Foods, which is also raising money to increase production capacity. Impossible investors are hoping the current fundraising would value that company at about $1bn. Impossible teamed up with Burger King to trial the “Impossible Whopper” this month in St Louis, Missouri, the heart of beef and barbecue country. José Cil, chief executive of Restaurant Brands International, the owner of Burger King, told analysts that it was preparing more test markets followed by a nationwide launch at the end of this year. Beyond Meat’s revenue in 2018 was $87.9m, up from $32.6m in 2017, with net losses flat at about $30m in each year. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse are lead underwriters on the offering.","02.05.2019"

"Stocks to watch: Publicis, WPP, Aston Martin, Tui, Wirecard, Asos","Superdry’s brand value makes it an attractive recovery play, says Morgan Stanley","Friday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● Publicis led the advertising agencies lower after a profit warning, which it blamed on tougher conditions in the US.  Second-quarter organic revenue growth of 0.1 per cent missed expectations centred at 0.7 per cent as the group’s North American traditional advertising division lost clients. As a result, Publicis said full-year organic revenue growth would be broadly stable against 2018 rather than higher, as previously indicated, and that margin expansion would be at the lower end of previous guidance due to restructuring and acquisition costs. “Operationally, the weakness in North America is the biggest concern given (1) Publicis is the strongest player in North American media buying, which should be the highest margin part of the business and (2) we now have two major agencies (WPP and Publicis) both having weakness in North America, which raises questions as to what is happening in this particular market. Until we feel more comfortable that there are no more unexpected downgrades coming through, we think it is best to downgrade to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’”Liberum ●  Acacia Mining led the FTSE 250 gainers after Barrick Gold, its 63.9 per cent shareholder, made a final all-stock offer to buy out the minority on improved terms.  Barrick offered 0.168 of a share for each Acacia share, an increase of about 10 per cent from the initial ratio of 0.153 of a share, for a readthrough valuation of around 231p. Completion required 75 per cent acceptance from minority shareholders, which analysts saw as a formality given a recent heightening of tensions between Acacia and the Tanzanian government. ● Aston Martin Lagonda rose after its key investor, Strategic European Investment Group, offered to raise its holding by buying back a 3 per cent stake at £10 apiece. SEIG, a holding company controlled by Italian private equity group Investindustrial, had retained a 31 per cent stake in Aston when it floated in November at £19 per share. ● Tui climbed on a combination of renewed optimism about its UK business and hopes of compensation from Boeing following the grounding of its 737 Max jets. Boeing said overnight that it would book a $4.9bn after-tax charge to cover “potential concessions and other considerations to customers” as well as reduced production. Tui’s fleet of 150 aircraft includes 15 grounded 737 Max jets with a further eight not yet delivered, having been ordered for May. Analysts also highlighted research agency GfK reporting “a huge turnaround” in summer outbound holiday bookings in the UK. Cumulative bookings, which were down 7 per cent in the first four months of the year, had rebounded in the last nine weeks on demand for all-inclusive deals and were now up 1 per cent for the season to date, GfK data suggested. ● Wirecard rose after the payments processor said it had signed a memorandum of understanding to work with retailer Aldi on developing cashless payments in Germany. As part of the partnership, Wirecard will process all credit card and international debit card payments at Aldi’s German stores. “Overall, there is a great opportunity for Wirecard to capture additional transaction volume on the back of the Aldi partnership, while we’re expecting the incremental take rate to be below group average levels,” said Baader Helvea Equity Research. “When Wirecard provided the last time an update of its Vision 2020 and 2025, neither the partnership with Softbank nor the partnership with Aldi were known. With these kind of partnerships traditionally not being included in the mid-term ambitions, we believe that especially Vision 2025 has a substantial upside bias.” Sellside stories ● Morgan Stanley started coverage of Superdry with an “overweight” and an 890p price target, and put an “equal weight” rating on fellow fashion retailer Ted Baker.  “We do not believe either brand is ‘broken,” said Morgan Stanley. A consumer survey ”supports our view that neither brand has become irrelevant. Brand perception, at least in the UK, has remained relatively stable year over year.” Brand strengh was key for both companies because they are not burdened by onerous lease commitments and take just 25 per cent of sales from their own stores, said Morgan Stanley. Instead, Superdry and Ted Baker rely on wholesale, franchise, concession and licensing income so are more dependent on the strength of their ranges, it said.  And having fallen sharply in recent years Ted Baker and Superdry both trade at around 10 times earnings, which looks cheap for companies that have delivered annual profit growth of 13 per cent and 35 per cent respectively in the decade before last year. Superdry offers the best recovery potential, Morgan Stanley told clients. “We believe Superdry’s issues have been largely self-inflicted. Having met with Julian Dunkerton (the company’s founder, who recently returned to the business) following the preliminary results, we are hopeful that the business can be put back on track within a couple of seasons. If this proves possible, the shares could be worth as much as 2,100p (our bull case) . . .  Nevertheless we see the risk-reward as very attractive; given that the company has a robust balance sheet we believe even in a bear case scenario the shares would be worth 140p.Morgan Stanley On Ted Baker, Morgan Stanley cited the resignation of founder Ray Kelvin in March combined with a lack of potential positive catalysts. ● Barclays downgraded Asos to “equal weight” from “overweight” on the back of Thursday’s profit warning from the online retailer. Management’s failure to improve the US customer offer and fix problems automating its European warehouses have eroded confidence, said Barclays, which set a £27.50 target price.  “On paper the issues in EU and US should be fixable with time given the problem is inventory led and not consumer driven. But we may not see evidence until the calendar fourth quarter at least, and before then we have to get through full-year results in October. With a relatively new chairman and a new chief finance officer, visibility is almost non-existent as to how they might guide for 2020. We don’t view the shares as cheap enough to fully compensate for the risk.”Barclays It said Delivery Hero, the German takeaway ordering website, offered more growth and lower risk at a similar valuation. ● In brief: Aker Solutions raised to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Aurubis cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Brinova Fastigheter raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Centamin raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Chesnara rated new “reduce” at Peel Hunt; Coloplast cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; EasyJet raised to “hold” at HSBC; Fresnillo cut to “neutral” at UBS; Givaudan cut to “sell” at Investec; Glencore cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; IMCD raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Kerry Group rated new “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Kesko raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Outokumpu raised to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Plastic Omnium raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Polyphor cut to “neutral” at UBS; SAP cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Theradiag raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Van Elle cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; Worldline cut to “neutral” at Macquarie.

"Appetite for Beyond Meat drives IPO price range higher","Vegan start-up valued at $1.5bn after issuing new shares at $25 each","Beyond Meat, the California-based company that makes plant-based burgers, raised $240.6m from an initial public offering that was increased on the strong appetite of investors for its growth prospects. The company priced 9.6m shares at $25 a piece, at the high end of an already upsized price range of $23-$25 a share, according to two sources with knowledge of the terms. The IPO price gives the company an initial market value of $1.5bn.  Beyond Meat’s flotation comes at a time when appetite for plant-based meat substitutes is growing. Consumers in developed markets are opting to eat less meat or turning to vegan or vegetarian foods, citing environmental and health concerns. “I am, like many, troubled by the fraying fabric of our rural heritage, one increasingly torn by vanquished towns, marginalised populations ensnared in an opioid crisis, and hidden factory farms,” Beyond Meat’s founder and chief executive Ethan Brown said in regulatory documents. He added that “instead of growing low-value commodity feed for animals, I see a future of farmers growing higher value protein crops for more direct human consumption via plant-based meat.” New spins on traditional vegetarian options are mimicking the taste, texture and smell of meat in order to attract meat-eating consumers. Rather than processing vegetables, Beyond Meat analysed the molecular structure of meat and recreated its own version using amino acids, lipids, minerals and vitamins extracted from plants. Beyond Meat’s burger, which accounted for 70 per cent of its revenue last year, is made primarily out of yellow peas and uses beet juice to mimic the “bleeding” of a meat burger.

"Bristol-Myers Squibb in $19bn debt sale to fund Celgene deal","Offering is the largest bond issue of 2019 so far","Bristol-Myers Squibb on Tuesday borrowed a mammoth $19bn of debt to fund its takeover of rival pharmaceutical company Celgene, in the largest bond issue of the year so far. With orders that had reached $70bn by early afternoon, according to people familiar with the deal, bankers reduced the yields on the new bonds from earlier guidance.  Some investors had expected the company to try to sell the bonds on Monday, but market volatility caused by President Donald Trump’s talk of higher tariffs on China had kept issuers at bay.  The issue split into nine different securities, ranging from 1.5 years to 30 years in maturity, according to people familiar with the plans. The initial yield on the 10-year bond was set at 1.05 per cent above treasuries, down from the 1.2 per cent indicated earlier in the day. The figure is still higher than the 0.9 per cent BMS paid when it last issued 10-year debt in 2017, and above the current average of 0.9 per cent for single-A rated companies, according to an index run by Ice Data Services.  The $90bn acquisition of Celgene is one of the largest pharmaceutical deals in history, as BMS aims to create a world leader in oncology. The deal replenishes BMS’s pipeline of future drugs, and it benefits in the short term from sales of Revlimid, the cancer treatment that is Celgene’s primary product.  Together, the companies will have nine so-called blockbuster drugs — products that generate more than $1bn in annual revenue — and a pipeline of drugs in development that could create annual sales $15bn, the company says.  The takeover was controversial, attracting opposition from large BMS shareholders Wellington Management and activist Starboard Value worried about Celgene’s heavy dependence on Revlimid, which faces the prospect of generic competition as patents start to expire in 2022. Starboard said the Revlimid “patent cliff” would be an overhang on the company’s shares for years to come and suggested BMS should scrap the deal in favour of putting itself up for sale.  BMS won the backing of the influential shareholder advisory groups ISS and Glass Lewis, however, and won a shareholder vote in mid-April.  The BMS bond issue is the first of a handful of large, acquisition-related sales expected this month. FIS, a Florida-based technology group, begins investor meetings this week to raise debt for its acquisition of Worldpay, with $11bn expected to be issued. T-Mobile has begun investor meetings for its still-unapproved acquisition of Sprint. IBM will also require funding for its takeover of Red Hat. The BMS sale is the largest since the US cable company Comcast issued $27bn in October 2018 to fund its acquisition of Sky. Since then, the Federal Reserve’s pause on further interest rate increases has stoked interest in investment grade bonds this year.  “We have had a small pipeline of M&A-related deals but suddenly it seems like a number of them could go in May,” said Hans Mikkelson, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Barclays, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo were in charge of managing the BMS bond sale.","07.05.2019"
"Qatar attracts $50bn of bids for $12bn bond sale","Strong demand underscores renewed investor interest in EM assets","Qatar has carried out a bumper bond sale — raising $12bn — in the latest sign that the market for emerging market sovereign debt is again booming.  The Gulf state racked up order books of $50bn for the five-, 10- and 30-year bonds. Its first dollar-denominated debt sale of the year on Wednesday came two months after regional rival Saudi Arabia sold $7.5bn in bonds after drawing orders of $27bn. The strong investor appetite for Qatar’s offering underscored the renewed interest in EM assets amid diminishing expectations for further US interest rate rises this year.  EMs have sold $78bn of sovereign bonds since the start of this year, the second-highest total on record after 2016, according to figures from data provider Refinitiv.  Last month, going long EMs became the most crowded trade in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor survey. Qatar and Saudi Arabia’s rivalry has played out in debt markets. Last year, Qatar’s $12bn bond sale exceeded Saudi Arabia’s effort just days earlier, which raised $11bn and was seen by some as an attempt to soak up demand that would otherwise go to Qatar. Qatar’s $2bn, five-year bond was on Wednesday sold at a spread of 90 basis points over the equivalent US Treasury bond, with the $4bn, 10-year debt at a 135bp spread and the $6bn, 30-year debt at a 175bp spread.  A banker on the deal who was not authorised to speak said it was “an endorsement from global investors of what Qatar has achieved despite the complications around the political situation in the region”. The improvement in wider market conditions since the start of this year was helpful, the banker added. “As an issuer, you need to be savvy and pick the right moment as these windows of opportunity open and close.” The 30-year bond was marketed specifically to attract Taiwanese investors.  Taiwanese authorities last year stamped down on “Formosa bonds” — dollar-denominated securities that are issued locally.  But the country’s giant insurance industry has turned to locally listed exchange traded funds that buy overseas, dollar-denominated bonds.  The funds are denominated in the Taiwan dollar, providing a way around recently imposed regulatory restrictions on foreign assets. Qatar is rated Aa3 by Moody’s, AA- by S&P and AA- by Fitch. Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, QNB Capital and Standard Chartered were bookrunners on Wednesday’s deal. ","06.03.2019"
"Trump’s America leads charge in global dealmaking","The US-China trade war has led to a sharp drop in cross-border deals so far in 2019","Donald Trump likes to claim that the US is always winning. But when it comes to the business of dealmaking, there is no dispute. The record-breaking boom in global mergers and acquisitions has extended into the first half of 2019, yet unlike the past five years, bankers in Europe and Asia have been left as envious observers while the US takes a dominant role.  Ambitious deals by large companies ranging from drugmaker AbbVie to defence contractor United Technologies, to oil group Occidental Petroleum, have driven US activity. Buoyant stock markets and cheap financing in the debt markets have helped oil the wheels of a record first half in which $1.1tn worth of US corporate takeovers have been struck. The volume of deals, up almost a fifth from a year ago, accounts for more than half of the activity this year, according to data provider Refinitiv. America’s share of the global takeover pie has not been this big since before the dotcom boom and bust.   The striking concentration of M&A within US borders — at the expense of cross-border deals — was in part a consequence of the Trump administration’s more protectionist approach, including its trade war against China, multiple top M&A advisers told the Financial Times.  “We are heading into a more mercantile world, with protectionism [and] the trade dispute with China,” said Mark Shafir, the co-head of global M&A at Citigroup. “It is logical the transactions you see are more local in nature. It is not the most hospitable environment for cross-border deals.” Although the level of global dealmaking in the first half was still the third-highest on record, the $2tn total was down 13 per cent from last year and included a sharp slowdown outside the US. European transactions tumbled 57 per cent to $287bn, marking the weakest first half in six years. Activity in Japan dropped 23 per cent to $38bn, with the value of deals in the rest of Asia Pacific coming in at $342bn, down 28 per cent from the first half of 2018.  Africa and the Middle East was the only region outside the Americas to see a pick-up in activity. A single $69bn deal engineered by Saudi Arabia to bolster the prospects of its state oil company Saudi Aramco was chiefly responsible, underlining the outsized impact large deals can have. Across the world, companies are increasingly steering away from deals that are likely to face scrutiny from newly emboldened national security panels that last year blocked several high profile transactions.  Less than a quarter of the $2tn worth of deals struck this year have been cross border, the lowest level in more than two decades. By contrast, the 10 largest transactions have all been between companies located within the same country. The US has accounted for eight of them.  The trend has been a boon for American investment banks, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all gaining market share over Asian and European rivals, the Refinitiv data showed.  Deutsche Bank, Barclays and UBS all saw their share of M&A fall in the first half of the year, with Deutsche failing to make the top 10 merger advisers as boutiques like Evercore and PJT Partners muscled in. If Trump has cast a shadow over global dealmaking, the US administration faces a different test of its enthusiasm for blockbuster deals when the justice department rules on the merger of wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile. Approval of the deal, M&A advisers say, will send a signal that competition authorities in the US are willing to wave through deals over fierce competition concerns. A green light for the Sprint-T-Mobile combination would stand in contrast to outcomes in the UK and across continental Europe, where regulators have blocked several deals in the first half. UK supermarket chain J Sainsbury’s planned £7.3bn takeover of its Walmart-owned rival, Asda, was blocked, while a proposed tie-up of the train manufacturing arms of Germany’s Siemens and France’s Alstom was scuppered by Brussels.  “The number-one question we get asked is will my deal even get approved?” says Hernan Cristerna, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan Chase.  “If the trend of North American companies announcing most of the largest deals so far this year continues, European companies will need to react, including creating European champions to challenge an ‘America First’ policy and the threat of an expansionist China strategy,” he added.  Efforts to kick-start dealmaking in Europe have run into roadblocks. An attempted €33bn tie-up between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France’s Renault that would have created the third-largest automaker, was abandoned after FCA’s chairman grew frustrated with delays from the board of the French carmaker.  A long hoped for merger between Deutsche Bank and its domestic rival Commerzbank collapsed after weeks of talks, with the two German lenders warning there were too many hurdles to justify such a complex deal. And one of the biggest attempted leveraged buyouts of a German company unravelled in May, after shareholders blocked the takeover of Scout24 by Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone on concerns over the price. Cathal Deasy, head of European M&A at Credit Suisse, said: “When you look at $10bn or less, the activity in Europe is healthy. But the big cross-border European deals over that size just are not there. If you look at cross-border M&A over the past few years, it’s been dominated by inbound deals into the region by Japanese and US buyers. They just are not there right now.”  A pick-up in activist hedge funds targeting Europe has been one impetus for deals in the region, as companies pursue simplification plans to either address or head off attacks. In Germany, Siemens and Volkswagen both announced plans to hive off large units of their business, while in Switzerland, Novartis did the same. Nestlé sold its skin health business to private equity group EQT for over $10bn.  The deglobalisation of dealmaking has played out in Asia, too, as activity within the region has increased. M&A between countries, including Japan and Australia has remained solid, helped by Nippon Paint’s $2.7bn buyout out of DuluxGroup in April. Japanese companies have also been active across south-east Asia. “One segment of Asia Pacific M&A activity that’s up is in-region cross-border M&A, while Asia outbound activity has been impacted by a heightened level of cautiousness,” said Tom Barsha, co-head of Asia Pacific M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Having led Asian M&A as recently as 2016, the overseas ambitions of Chinese companies have been blunted. The trade war, increasing scrutiny of Chinese technology deals in the US and tougher financing conditions at home have all been headwinds. “Many Chinese corporations are being very cautious and the credit lines have not been as strong,” said Philip Li, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Hong Kong.

"Holding back the risk dam from cracking","Mike Mackenzie’s daily analysis of what’s moving global markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email. There is only one story for markets at present, but the risk dam holds from cracking for now as the final trading month of the second quarter gets under way.  Over the weekend China announced new tariff increases on US goods and a probe into FedEx, representing the latest escalation over trade between the world's big two economies. After President Donald Trump signalled higher tariffs for Mexico last week, markets heard that India faced the end of favourable tariff status with the US. I wrote on Friday after the Mexico shock that US trade policy was moving to a two-front war, but the target zone keeps widening and for all the eye-popping shifts in havens such as government bonds, the market trend is your friend when the hits on trade keep coming.  Investors are in a difficult place as there has long been a view that cooler heads would eventually prevail over trade. David Kelly at JPMorgan Funds says investors should focus on a middle path outcome, or one whereby: “The Administration is sensitive to the behaviour of the economy and the stock market and will tend to calibrate its statements and actions on trade to that reality.”  While global equities suffered their worst month for the year during May, they are still above their 2018 lows by some margin. (The FTSE All-World remains 13 per cent above its December nadir and some 8 per cent higher for 2019.) The relatively contained reaction in equities (outside of big tech sliding on Monday on Wall Street as US regulators prepare antitrust probes) reflects hope of a trade war thaw and a degree of assistance from the sharp drop in bond yields and rising expectations of central bank easing for risk assets. This is highlighted by a steep rise in US interest rate volatility that has not yet been followed by credit and equities. Credit Suisse’s Mandy Xu says: “The bond market is signalling an extremely pessimistic outlook on growth”, adding that “while equity and credit vols have all increased, they paint a much more benign growth outlook, with both still far below their Q4 extremes”. Chart: Credit vol vs Rate vol
  But the chance of a more dramatic reaction in equities and credit (triple C debt now lags double B-rated paper in total return terms for the first time this year, notes Bank of America Merrill Lynch) is building as the G20 meeting looms at the end of June.  That nurtures demand for havens. One story on Monday is how gold has broken out to the upside, while the yen garners buyers or traders unwinding carry trades based on borrowing in the Japanese currency.   The gold price (after being a laggard of late) has finally broken above $1,300 an ounce and has eclipsed its March high at $1,324. This comes as the US dollar, which of late has enjoyed “haven” buying, is under pressure as Treasury yields extend their drop from May into June.  No matter that government bonds ended May at very rich levels and seemed vulnerable to a pullback, the latest trade developments only intensified the rally in US Treasuries and other benchmarks on Monday. Although the 10-year German Bund is finding minus 0.22 per cent a tough barrier to crack for now.  The 10-year US Treasury note dipped below 2.10 per cent on Monday, while note yields with a maturity of five years and less slid under 1.90 per cent. On Friday, they closed below 2 per cent, so the pace of the rally has only intensified. The policy-sensitive two-year yield closed out last Wednesday at about 2.10 per cent and on Monday briefly flirted with 1.84 per cent, a stunning drop and the kind of fireworks last seen during the financial crisis. In turn, the January 2020 Federal funds futures contract implies a rate of 1.75 per cent by the end of the year; in effect, getting the market closer to pricing in 75 basis points of easing.  Helping sustain the Treasury rally on Monday were comments from James Bullard, head of the St Louis Fed and a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Mr Bullard, who is a leading policy dove, said lower interest rates may be “warranted soon”, citing trade war risks, slowing global growth and the lack of inflationary pressure in the US. The bond message is blunt and paints a weakening global economy with disinflationary tones also shading the outlook. Backing that point, the latest run of purchasing manager index readings provide scant cheer. China’s Caixin produced a modest uptick in May to stay just in expansion territory, at odds with the official reading which is below 50. Activity contracted in South Korea (a barometer for global trade) Europe and the UK. The US ISM manufacturing report for May arrived at 52.1 below a forecast read of 53 and also less than April's figure of 52.8. Such a backdrop before the latest escalation over tariffs suggests the fear trade will resonate until the G20 meeting provides some clarity. Demand for haven assets shows portfolios are being rotated with investors adding more protection in the form of government bonds. That suggests any sell-off in government bonds as being a corrective at best as the trend of “lower for longer” remains intact. As for the US, some argue that easier Fed policy does not compute when the economy is growing and companies are still hiring, a point that the May employment report on Friday should affirm. The counter is that after an inventory-driven bump in the first quarter, payback looms and we have seen lower durable goods and non-defence capital goods spending of late.  And in a global financial system, the bond market will lean towards rate cuts. Here’s Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets on that topic: “All else being equal, it is difficult to imagine an ease given the domestic backdrop. Alas, the next leg in monetary policy will be a function of overseas developments as [Jay] Powell tacitly accepts the Fed’s role as the world’s de facto central bank.” Be ready when the London market opens, with Cat Rutter Pooley’

 Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar Central banks in the spotlight — Markets expect an easing in Australia on Tuesday, knocking the cash rate down to 1.25 per cent from 1.5 per cent, while a 25bp cut from India to 5.75 per cent on Thursday is also anticipated. On Thursday, the European Central Bank meeting is expected to deliver a dovish message as a key market measure of inflation expectations sits within sight of its all-time low of 1.25 per cent. But what the market and bank shares would really like to see is a shift away from financial institutions stuck with negative overnight rates.  That prospect looks faint as BNP Paribas note: “Expectations of ECB tiering of negative deposit rates have evaporated from eurozone bank valuations over the past six weeks.” The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index has fallen nearly 18 per cent since April 17 and on Monday shares in Deutsche Bank plumbed a new record low, falling below 6 euros. Waiting for value to return — Société Générale’s Andrew Lapthorne highlights how the “value universe offers compelling value” with risk premia the widest “at any point except for the few months after Lehman’s collapse”. For all the “upside potential”, there’s no getting away from the fact that “timing and downside have always been problematic for value”, a key reason for the lofty risk premia. But as Andrew reminds us:  “If you bought value at the end of October 2008, a year later you would have made 60%+ on a long-long global basis, twice the return of the equal-weighted benchmark. But you would have had to endure 15% further downside while waiting. We still think that on a 12-month view value has a part to play in your portfolio.”  Keep up to date with the top M&A stories, sharp analysis and insight on the dealmakers —

"Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund back in the hunt for deals","Fund chairman says QIA is returning to buying stakes directly in companies","Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund has signalled an ambition to reclaim its position as one of the oil-rich Gulf region’s most acquisitive investors, putting companies on notice as it hunts for new deals. The Qatar Investment Authority is ramping up its investment plans in North America and Asia, and creating a unit to scour for opportunities in emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and Asia in an effort to snap up stakes in companies directly.  It echoes the approach that catapulted the fund on to the global stage a decade ago when it earned a reputation as an aggressive and swashbuckling investor. After a failed 2007 takeover bid for UK supermarket Sainsbury’s, the QIA purchased minority stakes in Barclays, Credit Suisse, Porsche and Volkswagen during the financial crisis.  However, the fund’s spending spree was curtailed about five years ago as a shift in strategy, which saw the QIA allocate more money to third-party fund managers, coincided with Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani succeeding his father as emir and a fall in oil prices.  In 2017, the QIA was forced to repatriate more than $20bn in overseas deposits to stabilise the domestic financial sector after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport links with the gas-rich state.  That diplomatic crisis remains deadlocked but Qatar, the world’s richest state in per capita terms, believes it has overcome the financial impact. Now its flagship fund is reducing its holdings in externally managed funds to refocus on direct investments in companies and other assets, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, the QIA’s chairman, told the Financial Times.  “In the past three years, we invested more in funds, but now we have been more active in the direct investment,” said Sheikh Mohammed, who is also the foreign minister. “The management style at that time was [that] investing in funds was better; now there’s a new management.” In the past six months, we have been quite active, mainly in North America . . . we are opportunistic investors, so if we see an opportunity we go for itSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, QIA chairman Sheikh Mohammed took over as chairman in November, two months after Mansoor al-Mahmoud was appointed QIA’s chief executive. The QIA’s new approach includes a focus on the technology sector that could put it in competition with Saudi Arabia’s and the UAE’s sovereign investment funds and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. There are already signs of renewed confidence in its approach, after the QIA last month led a $500m equity financing for SoFi, a US digital lender.  “In the past six months, we have been quite active, mainly in North America . . . we are opportunistic investors, so whenever we see an opportunity we go for it,” said Sheikh Mohammed, who is seen as a rising star in the government. “We are still investing in Europe, but we are more focusing and directing the funds to Asia and the US.” Sheikh Mohammed said that alongside a focus on technology, healthcare and industrial companies, the QIA is also increasing its weighting to North America and Asia where it was underinvested.  A previous target of investing $35bn in the US between 2015 and 2020 will be increased by $10bn, he said. In April, the QIA and US-based Crown Acquisitions invested in properties in New York’s Times Square and along Fifth Avenue, including the St Regis Hotel and luxury jeweller Harry Winston. The fund and Crown said they would each acquire a 24 per cent stake in properties controlled by Vornado Realty Trust, which they estimated to be worth $5.6bn. The QIA declined to give details of the fund’s asset allocation. “I’ve seen them looking at more things and being very transaction driven . . . primarily tech,” a senior banker said. “They are now feeling confident that the blockade is not the end of the world — there’s a cost factor, they know what it is and what they can be doing.” The IMF said in a report this month that Qatar’s international reserves, excluding the QIA, reached $30.5bn at the end of December, up from $15bn at the end of 2017. It added: “Qatar’s economy has successfully adjusted to the dual shocks of lower oil prices and diplomatic rift.” Sheikh Mohammed said the QIA still had funds in some Qatari banks, but added “when we find opportunities we will not hesitate to take some of the cash outside”.  However, bankers said the QIA had been receiving less generous funding in recent years as Qatar, the world’s top export of liquefied natural gas, grappled with lower revenues in the wake of the 2014 drop in oil prices, while also spending billions of dollars on infrastructure for the 2022 football World Cup.

"European banks fear no escape from negative rates","Lenders prepare to cut costs even as ECB offers some protection from negative rates","European lenders are bracing for deeper cost cuts and consolidation after the European Central Bank extended a punishing five-year stretch of negative interest rates. The region’s banks were left disappointed by Mario Draghi’s last major act as ECB president, in which he last week cut its key deposit rate to  minus 0.5 per cent, while also unveiling a new tiering system designed to shield a portion of the deposits lenders keep at the ECB from negative rates. However, the relief provided by tiering will barely offset the lost earnings from lower base rates, according to analysts and executives interviewed by the Financial Times, piling pressure on a sector already struggling to generate acceptable returns. The ECB is expected to cut its deposit rate again by next year, which could lower even further the Euribor rate on which many loans are priced. “Deposit tiers . . . [are] a drop in the ocean,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Magdalena Stoklosa. “Profitability uplifts could be minimal for most banks . . . as sensitivity to Euribor is multiple times greater versus savings on cash reserves parked at the ECB.”  Negative interest rates were first introduced in the region in June 2014 to boost a flagging economy by nudging banks into lending more money, rather than leaving excess liquidity languishing at the central bank. But its knock-on effect has been to further dent the already-strained earnings of Europe’s banks, which are holding a combined €1.9tn of reserves to satisfy post-crisis regulations. The benchmark index for the sector is languishing near a 20-year low and the average return on equity of European banks stands at just around 6 per cent, far below their estimated 11 per cent cost of equity and barely half the level of their US rivals. “Deposit tiering doesn’t help us even nearly enough,” said a top executive at a major German lender. “The ECB’s decisions make it impossible to generate a return of 10 per cent or more. In this environment we’ll do well to get to 7 [per cent].” It is a view echoed by Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, who expects lenders to unleash a lending price war to win share in a market in which deposits are growing faster than loans. “The ECB is in effect reducing the structural profitability of European banks in the long run, while tiering is only helping in the short term,” said Mr Abouhossein. “Banks can only deal with this is to become more competitive on the cost side, or by engaging in M&A.”  In 2018, European banks paid €7.2bn in interest for their deposits at the ECB, according to the Association of German Banks. The lobby group estimates that tiering will lower the annual bill to €5bn as the ECB won’t charge negative rates on about €800bn of liquidity parked with it.   Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup estimate European banks’ net profits will rise an average 2 per cent, but cautioned this would be offset by a negative 1.5 per cent hit from the 10 bps rate cut in the ECB’s key rate.  Deposit-heavy Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank should benefit the most with around 12 per cent and 3 per cent uplift respectively, but those numbers are flattered by the current low levels of profits.  “We believe the impact is net neutral for the sector,” Citi’s Andrew Coombs said. “Ultimately banks are still hurt from the effective zero-bound on deposits . . . [and] passing on negative rates to retail clients is still politically unpalatable.” The deposit-tiering system, modelled on that of the Swiss central bank, gives lenders an exemption for their excess deposits up to six times the value of their minimum reserve requirements at the ECB. This compares with 20 times at the Swiss National Bank and even higher in Japan. Mr Draghi, who steps down at the end of October, said the new system was not intended as a subsidy for banks. He sharply pushed back against criticism from the likes of Deutsche chief executive Christian Sewing, who warned that cutting interest rates further into negative territory would “ruin the financial system”. Mr Draghi said executives should focus on cutting costs and digitising their business models rather than “being angry about negative rates”. Banking lobbyists reply that the ECB’s policy is harming an industry that is already frail. Hans-Walter Peters, president of the Association of German Banks, points out that at €2.3bn, the annual bill for German banks from negative interest rates in 2018 was equivalent to close to 10 per cent of the sector’s annual pre-tax profit.  “It’s just not reasonable to weaken European banks like this,” he said. Negative interest rates have sparked fierce criticism, particularly in Germany, where they are accused of punishing savers. Last week, the German tabloid newspaper Bild Zeitung accused Mr Draghi of being “Count Draghila” who “sucks our bank accounts empty”. Finance minister Olaf Scholz is considering pre-emptively banning banks from passing on the cost of “penalty rates” to high street savers. As central banks cut rates around the world it is stirring up a debate about the impact on the banking system. The US Federal Reserve is on Wednesday expected to cut its interest rates by a quarter point for the second time in two months, while on Thursday the Swiss central bank may also to cut its rates deeper into negative territory from minus 0.75 per cent. In Europe, many banks are already passing at least some of the cost of negative rates on to companies and other financial institutions. In Switzerland UBS and Credit Suisse recently started charging their wealthiest clients to deposit francs and euros.  However, no bank thus far has dared impose charges on regular retail customers, a politically contentious move that many fear could push consumers to move their money to a cheaper rival or withdraw it as cash.  Amid general disquiet that tiering fails to offer sufficient protection, Italian and other southern-European banks could prove relative winners from the policy. One tactic could be for them to sell short-term, negative-yielding sovereign bonds and put the money on deposit at the ECB for free instead. Another could be to utilise the ECB’s third iteration of its ultra-cheap “targeted longer-term refinancing operation” (TLTRO III). Under this new facility banks can borrow money for three years at minus 0.5 per cent, then deposit it for free at the central bank, pocketing the difference. “The ECB in effect creates the opportunity for a carry trade,” said Mr Abouhossein, adding that banks in the eurozone’s periphery will be able to park €55bn in the ECB’s negative-rate-exempt facility. About €43bn of that sits at Italian banks with the remainder in Portugal and Greece, according to Mr Abouhossein. German banks are hit the hardest in Europe by negative interest rates as they hold about a third of the total excess ECB deposits. Deutsche has been the most vocal, considering its woes and its systemic importance to the eurozone. Deutsche normally holds around €75bn and €100bn at the central bank, which means the  minus 0.4 per cent rate cost it around €400m in 2018. Under the new regime, the outlays will roughly halve, according to JPMorgan, boosting the expected 2020 profit before tax by 10 per cent. However, executives had counted on interest rates rising out of negative territory by 2022, the last year of their three-year turnround plan. Instead, the ECB has signalled negative rates will remain for at least the medium term. As a result, less than two months after announcing radical cuts to its investment bank and new financial targets, Deutsche has already softened the goals. Chief financial officer James von Moltke has said it will earn as much as €1bn less than the €25bn initially sought by 2022. Privately, executives admit making a return on tangible equity of 8 per cent may no longer achievable in that timeframe. Every single European bank is looking at their business plan afresh in light of the new environment,” said one senior banker at a Swiss lender. “Some very tough decisions are going to have to be made in the next few months.”","18.09.2019"
"Why gold still shines for some despite a difficult decade","What remains a popular investment for many clients is seen as too unpredictable for others","Gold’s unique place in portfolios faces a series of tests. Its tepid performance since its 2011 peak, an uncertain global economic outlook, the rise of cryptocurrencies and a drive towards sustainable investing have all put off US investment advisers from turning to the metal — even as their clients have ever more ways to invest. While gold tends to be a small holding for a limited number of clients, advisers say, it stands apart from other commodities because of complicated supply and demand trends that emerge from its many portfolio roles: as a safe haven asset, a consumable product, a de facto currency and a deposit of value. Gold is a unique commodity, says Brent Armstrong, partner at Weatherly Asset Management, an $833m independent advisory firm in California that caters to clients with $2m to $25m in assets. “We can look at its use in jewellery and electronic products, but it’s also been a human emotional store of value for thousands of years. That often clouds the lines, and creates movements and exuberance around the asset class.” Gold today trades around $1,300 per ounce, some way down from the 2011 peak of $1,900, which followed the financial crisis. Juan Carlos Artigas, director of investment research at the World Gold Council, says that although gold makes up less than 1 per cent of all global assets — estimated at $317tn by Credit Suisse last year — it remains an active market. Gold demand was up 7 per cent year-on-year to 1,053 tonnes in the first quarter this year, according to World Gold Council data, thanks in part to a spike in purchases by central banks and exchange traded funds tracking the asset class. Investors own gold for a variety of reasons, such as diversification, liquidity and hedging. They gain exposure to it largely through bars, coins, ETFs, futures and mining company stocks. Many choose physical gold for a longer-term asset, while ETFs that own gold reserves or futures contracts — a $100bn market — offer a more liquid exposure, meaning investors can sell quickly if necessary. Many factors help set gold’s value, from consumer demand to movements in interest rates, the US dollar, and global GDP. For example, the price of gold suffers from higher interest rates, as investors sell it to buy interest-generating assets. You’d be surprised at how many of them invest in bars as a way to store moneyLaurie Kamhi. managing director at LCK Wealth Management This year, Mr Artigas says investors should look out for the impact on gold of capital markets volatility, the path of US Federal Reserve policy and the pace of global structural economic reforms. But some clients seek gold investments no matter the trends, says Laurie Kamhi. She is managing director at New York-based LCK Wealth Management, part of the $48bn HighTower Advisors platform, which serves entrepreneurs and executives. “You’d be surprised at how many of them invest in bars as a way to store money,” Ms Kamhi says. Gold’s role in portfolios can be limited, as is the case for Chicago-based RMB Capital, a $9.4bn independent adviser and asset manager. “We see it as a more tactical opportunistic investment for when the right macro factors are in play,” says RMB vice-president Ryan Kennedy. “It’s not a permanent part of client portfolios.” One current opportunity for gold and other commodities to come into favour is if the dollar weakens, Mr Armstrong says. “While the dollar is strong, there’s a chance for it to reverse in the near and medium term,” he says. RMB Capital tends to invest in gold through ETFs. In the past this was done using a dedicated strategy, but more recently RMB has used a diversified commodity allocation that invests in futures contracts, Mr Kennedy says. LCK Wealth also has moved from gold ETFs in recent years to seeking gold exposure in blended commodities funds. A concern for advisers in the longer term is the underwhelming performance of the asset class so far this decade. “There have been number of different market events that could have allowed gold to advance, but didn’t,” says Mr Armstrong. Another challenge is a trend among some investors to use cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a rival savings medium, according to Ms Kamhi. “There is a lot of interest in whether the crypto market over the very long term will replace the need for gold,” she says. Indeed, many investors who in the past considered gold a safe haven when the dollar falls may instead look to the yen or government bonds, Mr Armstrong says. “It remains to be seen if gold could get pushed to the back burner, or if the emotional connection holds true,” he adds. The rise of sustainable investing could pose yet another set of obstacles for ownership of the metal, Ms Kamhi predicts. Gold mining in particular raises the potential for environmental exploitation and fair labour and compensation problems, she says. “That’s a long-term trend, not for tomorrow morning,” she says. “But there may be a different view of its desirability. It’s not going to be a big holding in the sustainable funds.”","27.06.2019"
"Singapore exchange adapts as regional rivals encroach","Chinese market set to drive evolution of city’s financial services industry","SGX, the Singapore exchange, is preparing to defend one of its jewels — the futures contracts that allow overseas investors to speculate and insure themselves against sharp, sudden moves in Chinese blue-chip stocks. The exchange’s FTSE A50 is the sole offshore futures contract for China. It traded 28m contracts in its last quarter, up from 17m in the whole of 2013, and it accounts for around 45 per cent of the volumes in SGX’s derivatives business. That hegemony came under threat in March after rival Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) struck an agreement with MSCI, the global index provider, to license futures on the portion of its flagship Emerging Markets index that relates to Chinese stocks. MSCI is highly influential in global markets; analysts estimate that lifting the weighting in the Emerging Markets index could send as much as $125bn into Chinese stocks. 28mFTSE A50 contracts traded in its last quarter, up from 17m in whole of 2013 SGX’s derivatives business, the group’s biggest revenue generator, has been built largely on futures of Asia’s largest equity indices — in Japan, Taiwan, China and India. The market reaction to the MSCI deal was immediate. Credit Suisse called it “one of the biggest risks for SGX”, adding that “if HKEX goes ahead with the launch, it would negatively impact SGX’s profitability and share price”. Citigroup lowered its rating to “sell”; SGX shares fell more than 9 per cent in the following days. But Loh Boon Chye, SGX chief executive, was unperturbed, arguing that the exchange supplied investors with what they needed in a world where interest rates remained low. “It’s no longer just about investing in emerging markets as a bloc, such as ‘Asia’ or ‘Africa’, but about investing in one country,” he said.  “What makes SGX unique and relevant? You can trade different asset classes, they offer correlation and there are more efficiencies [in its clearing house], such as if you want to go long China, short Japan.” He added: “If you have a China portfolio strategy, we have a much broader country access, we provide the unifying platform,” noting that SGX had A50 equity and offshore renminbi futures, as well as commodities trading. With its links to the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, rival HKEX is pitching itself as a gateway between domestic Chinese investors and products, and the rest of the world. But it has yet to receive regulatory approval for its MSCI contract, and futures markets typically take years to build up liquidity.  Even so, SGX argues that the two contracts cater to different investor demands. The new HKEX futures will track all 421 large and mid-cap Chinese “A-shares” in MSCI’s benchmark Emerging Markets index. That could include Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong or New York.  SGX’s A50 futures index is designed to be hyper-liquid and is more weighted to financial stocks; offshore investors can track the 50 largest Chinese blue-chip shares by market capitalisation. Investors who want to hedge their exposures to the MSCI benchmark might prefer the MSCI future. A hedge fund seeking exposure to the Chinese market could turn to the A50 contract, as it is best able to replicate the market. Both sides could benefit if investors are willing to trade with China and set aside concerns about official intervention in the market.  “Having two different exchanges offering highly correlated futures tracking the China A-share market may also bring about a new class of clients: the arbitrage traders,” suggest analysts at DBS, the Singapore bank. Mr Loh also highlights that SGX has thrived despite losing market share, pointing out that it once held a monopoly on trading futures on Japan’s Nikkei index. “Japan now has 80 per cent of the market, but the market is 50 times bigger,” he says. Even so, SGX is diversifying into other markets, based around Singapore’s more traditional strengths. The city state is Asia’s largest foreign exchange trading hub. To that end, in March SGX purchased a stake in BidFX, a forex trading platform, for $25m with an option to purchase a controlling interest. The Singapore authorities are trying to encourage investment banks to place more of their physical infrastructure for trading forex, such as servers and data centres, on the island. That way local traders can receive faster, more up-to-date prices than those from Tokyo or London.  It’s no longer just about investing in emerging markets as a bloc . . . but about investing in one countryLoh Boon Chye, SGX chief executive Banks such as Standard Chartered, UBS and Citigroup have already announced plans to do so. “Over the next five years we would like forex to be as meaningful as equity index derivatives,” Mr Loh says. SGX also has designs on building out futures relating to commodities and freight to cater to the hundreds of container ships that dock daily in Singapore. The shipping industry is expected to benefit in the coming decades as China’s Belt and Road Initiative — a project to build infrastructure across Asia — comes to rely increasingly on Singapore’s deepwater port. Among its plans, SGX wants to use the 2016 purchase of London’s Baltic Exchange to help it build a market for container index futures. A Chinese market that is opening up rapidly might be a threat but could also power the next evolution of Singapore’s financial services industry.","27.06.2019"

"Global dealmaking hits slowest pace in more than two years","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Geopolitical tensions and fears of an economic slowdown have turned down the heat on global dealmaking, which has eased to the slowest pace in more than two years.  Simmering tensions between the US and China on trade and in the UK around Brexit have cast a shadow over merger activity despite a lower interest rate environment and plenty of available cash.  But what killed this quarter’s biggest deal was neither Brexit nor the trade war. It was a public health crisis. The $200bn tobacco industry merger between old cohorts Philip Morris International and Altria was abandoned due to concerns over vaping-related illnesses.   The running theme of mega transactions helped to offset a broad decline in dealmaking among smaller companies as well as a slight drop-off in private equity buyouts.  Dealmakers shook hands on roughly $740bn of transactions in the third quarter bringing the total number of deals this year to $2.8tn, according to new figures from Refinitiv, down 11 per cent from the same period last year. The three months to the end of September proved to be the quietest quarter for announced takeovers since the middle of 2017.  European deals are well off the pace from 2018, down 32 per cent to $556bn since the start of the year. No prizes for guessing why that is. Activity in Asia was also off sharply, hit by a steep decline in Chinese acquisitions. The drop off in Europe came even as investors have cheered a $27bn bid by the London Stock Exchange Group to purchase Refinitiv. That deal is under threat from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange which has made moves to acquire the London bourse.   The slowdown in merger and acquisition activity is reverberating across Wall Street, which has become dependent on the very largest transactions. It will make for interesting third-quarter earnings reports from banks later this month. It could be a sign that M&A is entering into the final innings of what has been one of the strongest and longest deal cycles in history. But with all of that dry powder available, there could be more deals on the horizon to whet dealmaking appetites.  Read more from the DD team here.  Saudi sweetens Aramco offering
 Saudi Arabia is trying every trick in the book to woo investors to the long-awaited stock market listing of Saudi Aramco.  Short of just forcing people to buy into the oil giant’s initial public offering (oh, wait), the kingdom is pulling out all the stops.  As the FT’s Anjli Raval reports, the latest is an annual dividend of $75bn to make the company more investable. Saudi Arabia has also said it will scale back global expansion plans to increase cash flow, change state royal payments and cut corporation tax.  Why? Advisers to the kingdom are pushing for a $2tn valuation for the company, despite projections of a $1tn-$1.5tn price, to placate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured below), who has set his sights on revamping Saudi Arabia’s economy with the proceeds.   Riyadh, which has been pursuing an IPO for Aramco for about three years, was thrown into disarray earlier this month after drone attacks hit key facilities that affected half of its oil production and sent crude prices soaring. Fitch Ratings downgraded Saudi Arabia as a result, citing vulnerabilities in the kingdom’s economic infrastructure. News of the investor payouts came the day after Prince Mohammed warned that oil prices could skyrocket to “unimaginably high numbers” due to tensions with Iran.  While the fiscal changes are aimed at making the company more palatable, they could end up backfiring, a person familiar with the measures told the FT: “If they’ve done it twice, why wouldn’t they do it a third or fourth time?”  However, even at a valuation of $2tn, the dividend yield would be lower than for international rivals. Investors would receive about 3.75 per cent as opposed to the 6.3 per cent yield for Royal Dutch Shell and 4.9 per cent for ExxonMobil.  Unizo’s white knight can’t save it from the hostilities
 The high jinks surrounding the Japanese property group Unizo continue to electrify the Tokyo stock market as speculation shifts to the next big question: who will go hostile first, the shareholders or one of the potential buyers?  Not too far behind is the supplementary teaser: how far will the Japanese government allow this situation to trample on the spirit of its newly-released “fair M&A guidelines”?  Unizo first received an unsolicited bid in July from a Japanese rival, HIS. It then managed to secure a higher “white knight” bid from SoftBank-owned Fortress a month later, forcing HIS to pull out.  Word began to spread that Unizo, which has “old Japan” written all over it, was looking for a white knight to buy it that would allow the company’s current management to remain in charge, rather than to secure the best deal for shareholders.  The Unizo share price has remained stubbornly above Fortress’s tender offer, as various hedge funds and activists (Elliott Management most prominent among them) have piled on to the shareholder register with an apparent determination to extract a higher price.  On Friday last week Unizo abruptly withdrew its recommendation in favour of the Fortress offer and then revealed the set of restrictive conditions it had offered another bidder, which the FT has confirmed is Blackstone, during discussions of an even higher bid, that has created the current impasse.    Some suspect that Unizo believes it has played this so that everyone will walk away and the job of killing the original HIS bid is done.  Nobody else seems to agree.  Some shareholders told the FT they’re looking into the viability of calling an extraordinary general meeting to oust current management, while other potential bidders are lawyering-up and wondering whether it’s really possible to go hostile in a market where such practices remain exceptional.

"Stocks to watch: Casino, Vodafone, Anglo American, Serco, M&B","Royal Mail pessimism has gone too far, says Goldman Sachs","Friday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● Casino bounced off a seven-month low after Rallye, the French retailer’s parent company, and its subsidiaries entered bankruptcy protection allowing debt payments to be suspended for up to 18 months. Trading had been suspended in Casino, Rallye and its publicly listed holding companies from Thursday morning until market close. “The good news is that the safeguard proceedings should break the ‘negative circle’ between Casino and Rallye . . . The bulk of Rallye’s credit lines had Casino shares pledged against them — so, the lower the Casino share price, the greater the concerns about Rallye’s refinancing capacity.”Société Générale But Kepler Cheuvreux saw Rallye’s proposed debt rescheduling as likely to be bad news for Casino in the longer term. The request from Jean-Charles Naouri, the group’s majority shareholder and chief executive, to spread repayments over 10 years “would be strongly negative for Casino, as it would imply increasing pressure to pay dividends over time, while the company is already struggling to deliver on free cash flow”. “While the banks are not allowed to sell the Casino shares they have as collateral, we believe they can start selling their debt exposure to Rallye to distressed investors (at a discount), who in return will put pressure on Casino’s share price (to cash in the spread). Moreover, a 10-year debt rescheduling at Rallye will imply that Casino will pay more dividends over 10 years (although they could cut dividends first in the short term), which is not in the interest of the minority shareholders. The way out is still a debt haircut at Rallye, and as a result, a change of control leading to the departure of [Mr Naouri]. This is the only way for Casino to come out stronger and to prevent further asset stripping.”Kepler Cheuvreux Sellside stories ● HSBC upgraded Vodafone from “hold” to “buy” with an unchanged 160p target price. With the telecom group’s dividend cut complete and the outcome of German spectrum auctions largely known, investors can instead move to improving operating trends as well as the completion of its Liberty Media asset acquisition, it said. The drop that followed Vodafone’s dividend cut earlier this month has taken the shares’ yield to 6.4 per cent, which offers investors an attractive entry point, said HSBC. By next financial year Vodafone’s payout will be just 60 per cent of net income after spectrum costs, the lowest at Vodafone in more than a decade, it forecast.  HSBC set its Vodafone target price based on a sector-average 4.9 per cent dividend yield. While closing that sector discount will take time, the catalysts remain in place with Vodafone management talking recently about revenue trends improving markedly from the quarter beginning June, it said. The tone of commentary “should get progressively brighter, including by the time of the first-quarter [trading update] in July”, it said. ● Goldman Sachs upgraded Royal Mail from “neutral” to “buy” with a 320p target price. Royal Mail hit a record low on Thursday, more than erasing a rally the day before that followed management cutting the dividend and setting out an investment plan to focus on its parcels and international businesses.  “The current share price discounts no improvement in the company’s profitability (even after the dividend cut, the stock is yielding 7 per cent), despite clear areas of efficiency potential. We believe that the recent capital markets day signals a clear shift of focus towards the faster growing part of the business, parcels, where the company is pursuing disciplined price increases to improve profitability. Royal Mail aims to become a parcels company that also delivers mail, from being a mail company that also delivers parcels.”Goldman Sachs Royal Mail has failed to grow UK revenue for six years as weak macroeconomic conditions held back mail volumes and parcels suffered from relatively low efficiency, Goldman said. This should change, with parcel volumes and revenue growth already accelerating and mail stabilising following last year’s introduction of GDPR legislation, it forecast. A January price increase should help underpin short-term trading while in the longer term the UK business still has “ample room for efficiency improvement”, Goldman argued. It saw these positives not yet in the price with Royal Mail trading at just nine times year-end 2020 earnings, shrinking to six times earnings in 2022. Separately, Liberum upgraded Royal Mail to from “sell” “hold”.  “Royal Mail’s new strategy has brought clarity to how management intends to deal with the substantial structural challenges faced by the group. We remain deeply cautious on the short-term outlook, the long-term challenges and the execution risks in Royal Mail’s new strategy. We believe there could be yet more downside risk in the short term. However, we see the valuation as more reflective of these challenges.”Liberum ● In brief: AIB raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Anglo American raised to top pick at RBC; Britvic upgraded to “buy” at Investec; Brooks Macdonald rated new “sector perform” at RBC; Close Brothers raised to “hold” at Investec; Danske Bank cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Ericsson raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Lundin Petroleum rated new “sell” at Société Générale; Mitchells & Butlers upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup and Liberum; Norcros rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Quilter rated new “outperform” at RBC; Sanne cut to “hold” at Liberum; Serco raised to “buy” at Liberum.

"Cooling corporate spending stirs up US political risks","Fear and lack of imagination show through in waning capital expenditure growth","Presidential campaigns will soon crank into high gear, with business and finance taking a more prominent role than in previous elections  When the Trump administration pushed through the most significant overhaul of the US tax code in a generation two years ago, it anticipated a boom in corporate spending that would cover the shortfall in government revenues. Companies would put the savings from lower corporate tax rates — which dropped from 35 per cent to 21 per cent — towards hiring workers, updating old machinery and expanding into new markets, asserting America’s economic hegemony and extending the post-crisis expansion. The US Treasury calculated the activity would add $1.8tn to the economy over a decade — figures that confounded economists across Wall Street. By one measure corporate spending did increase. Growth in US capital expenditure, or capex, hit 11 per cent in 2018 as profits surged during the first year of the new tax regime. But it has started to wither. In 2019 US capex growth will drop to just 3 per cent, according to S&P Global data published in June. The absence of such investment should spook equity investors.  “This is thin gruel after years of stimulus and means that capex will not offer much help in sustaining the current economic cycle,” said Gareth Williams, senior director for global research at S&P Global. Anaemic capex growth is unsettling. The S&P 500 index continues to reach record highs and low interest rates — set to drop even further — keep corporate borrowing at cheap levels. Yet companies are failing to put money behind new ideas to expand their businesses. Capex is a crude but important indicator of future profits. A new factory built today will churn out more products to sell tomorrow, the theory goes. An upgraded machine will operate more efficiently. Sales will increase and costs will drop, all boosting a company’s stock price. “Capex is about the future,” said Krishna Memani, vice-chairman of investments for Invesco, the Atlanta-based money manager with $1.2bn in assets. “If the current trend in capex doesn’t improve, profitability and productivity will deteriorate, putting economic growth and US stock market performance in jeopardy.” What is more, the impact of the tax boost is likely to fade. The tax changes included upfront advantages that phase out over time, reducing their impact as a driver of capital expenditure. Growth and profitability predictions are waning. Central bank easing is seen as an alternative source of support, but again, caution is warranted. Worries over growth and subdued inflation have increased expectations the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates. The market is heavily betting on this course of action, yet many US economists — including those at Citi — believe a rate cut may not emerge at all this year. Even if rates do tick downward, investors should take note: lower rates have in the past failed to spur capex or boost stock prices, according to Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse. “We see no reason to believe that this relationship will be different going forward,” Mr Golub said. “Investors may be fond of central bank largesse, but such actions do little to address the structural causes of falling rates, inflation expectations and growth.” The obvious cause behind muted capex: concerns over global growth, underscored by the trade tensions between the US and China. Companies are reluctant to invest because tariffs may disrupt supply chains, pushing up the cost of production and eroding the effects of fresh outlays of capital to support it, such as a new factory in Shenzhen or Guangzhou. Instead, US companies have increasingly looked to the simple ruse of share buybacks to juice their share prices. If a company takes large blocks of its own stock out of circulation, it boosts earnings per share, a metric used by investors to benchmark performance and by corporate boards to set pay. In 2018, US share buybacks hit $806bn, a record, but one which could be broken this year. First-quarter data showed US companies spent $205bn on buybacks, with the heaviest spender, Apple, buying almost $24bn. Buying back shares can be a sensible way of putting free cash to use. But when companies rely on it too heavily, it signals a dearth of good ideas for growth. Buybacks have also become a political focal point in the run-up to next year’s presidential election. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator vying to become the Democratic candidate, has called the practice “corporate self-indulgence”. In February he authored a bill banning buybacks unless companies raise employee wages to a minimum $15 per hour and improve parental and sick leave policies. Presidential campaigns will soon crank into high gear, with business and finance taking a more prominent role than in prior elections. The likes of Mr Sanders and fellow Democratic challenger Senator Elizabeth Warren may benefit by offering voters a strident rebuke of companies’ failure to share the benefits of tax cuts. The companies themselves, with a heavy reliance on buybacks, are providing plenty of fodder.","25.06.2019"

"There’s a black hole in the dollar funding market","It’s called the Fed’s foreign RRP facility. And it feeds on curve inversion.","It’s been a while since we checked in on what’s percolating through the mind of financial-plumbing specialist Zoltan Pozsar at Credit Suisse. And it looks like this was an error because we may have missed a whopper of a dollar funding story. Here’s the gist from the opening of his latest note (with our emphasis, oh, and RRP stands for reverse repurchase agreement): The FOMC should forget about r* for the moment and focus on Sagittarius-A* – the supermassive black hole at the center of global dollar funding markets.The black hole is the foreign RRP facility, which has seen close to $100 billion of inflows since the beginning of the year.The driver of these inflows is the curve inversion, and the longer the inversion persists the more inflows will follow. The trade war is also contributing to the inflows – given the inversion, as foreign central banks weaken their currencies they “buy” the foreign RRP facility and not Treasuries like in the past.Foreign central banks are rate shopping… …and an uncapped foreign RRP facility is what enables that. Like the matter that enters a black hole, the reserves that are sterilized by the foreign RRP facility are gone for good – like the reserves “shredded” via taper. It’s an important point because even if the Fed were to stop tapering (a monetary tightening measure which sees central banks absorbing the proceeds of maturing Treasuries rather than reinvesting them in further asset purchases), tightening would continue for as long as the uncapped foreign RRP facility attracts inflows. Which it would, says Pozsar, because of the curve inversion.  He predicts such inflows could eclipse $200bn by the year’s end with the consequence of pricing Treasury supply out of the market.  This suggests the Fed may have overdone its hiking cycle, something that now can only be fixed with rate cuts. (Which incidentally also means, eek, Donald Trump might be right about Powell’s policy.) Key to this conclusion is how the make-up of inflows into the foreign RRP facility has been changing over time. In 2015, for example, much of the growth of the facility was due to inflows from Japan’s Ministry of Finance.As Pozsar explains: ...the Fed, deeply concerned that it won’t be able to enforce a floor underneath o/n interest rates as it tries to exit ZIRP, uncapped the facility to help banks shed balance sheet by luring foreign central banks away from banks and into the foreign RRP facility, and to help ease the bill shortage in money markets by luring foreign central banks out of bills and into the foreign RRP facility. The important context at the time was the massive shortage of short-term safe assets in the system, which put negative pressure on short-end rates across the board. By diverting central bank liquidity away from commercial banks and over to the foreign RRP facility, the Fed thus released important bill supply into the market which alleviated that pressure and thus defended the rate floor. The rate-hiking cycle, however, has entirely reversed this situation. RRP inflows are now being fuelled not by balance sheet constraints or a shortage of quality collateral but the inverse: intraday liquidity constraints and a collateral surplus.  In short, there are too many dollar-denominated safe assets in the market and not enough liquidity and hence -- very possibly -- the makings of a fresh liquidity crisis. As Pozsar explains: Because inflows into the facility sterilize reserves and add collateral to the financial system, they worsen the collateral surplus. But don’t blame the foreign central banks placing cash into the facility, for they do what a rational person would do when offered something that has value – take as much of the stuff as they can, while they can. Pozsar adds the current inversion is the most extreme relative to overnight repo rates, and that historically this is the first time that the curve has inverted relative to these rates:  The usual structural incentive during a yield curve inversion is to sell long-term notes and buy short-term bills. This time, however, the greater incentive is to sell long-term notes and buy the foreign RRP facility, not bills. Thus the worse the inversion gets , the more dollar they’ll put at the foreign RRP facility. This incidentally ensures the short-term bill market doesn’t receive the offsetting flows it should. But there’s more! Conventionally, central banks that want to weaken their currencies relative to the dollar intervene by buying dollars and investing in Treasuries. But the recent interventions by the PBoC seem to have seen dollars invested in the foreign RRP facility as well as in Treasuries, says Pozsar. Every penny that flows into the facility, he says, makes it harder for banks to fund dealers, whose safe-asset inventories are growing partly due to the foreign RRP facility, and partly due to the circularity of the matter: …economists would refer to the above dynamics as pro-cyclical: more collateral supply, higher repo rates, more inflows into the foreign RRP facility, even more collateral supply. Which we guess means the Fed should cap or otherwise restrict the facility and begin to lower rates to avoid a major dollar funding squeeze.  But why might they not do this? One reason, says Pozsar, is that other central banks don’t cap their equivalent facilities, and the other is that the Fed is not the only one to be paying a better rate on its facility than can be achieved in local bill markets. According to Pozsar this is the result of strategic BoJ and ECB policy designed to encourage the lending of more dollars in the FX swap market, so as to avoid deeply negative reinvestment yields and make more bills available in their own financial systems. But it makes no sense for the Fed to do the same, he says. To the contrary doing so creates a paradox of thrift. The following is a stellar point by Pozsar: If the global financial system’s problem is a shortage of US dollars, it makes sense for foreign central banks to pull funds away from their local bill markets to help improve the reinvestment returns of dollar lenders and hence ease the flow of dollars, but it makes no sense for the Fed to do the same – if it does, it hurts the flow of dollars. Here is how… If the Fed offers a rate above Treasury bill yields on an uncapped the foreign RRP facility, it will attract inflows. Inflows sterilize reserves and increase collateral supply on the margin – instead of buying Treasury bills at auctions, the facility incentivises foreign central banks to deposit cash at the Fed. These dynamics put an upward pressure on local bill yields, and higher local bill yields reduce the allure of lending dollars in the FX swap market – the flow of dollars suffers and the Fed is pushing against the efforts of other central banks. So, unless the Fed takes action -- and by that Pozsar doesn’t mean technical action such as the creation of a standing repo facility or asset purchases -- the collateral tsunami may continue to worsen. It follows, Pozsar says, that if the Fed priced supply out of the market, it should now consider rate cuts instead: ”...rate cuts that are aggressive enough to re-steepen the curve so that dealer inventories can clear; cuts deep enough to incentivise real-money investors to lend long, not short and foreign investors to buy Treasuries on an FX hedged basis on scale again.” That makes this weekend’s Jackson Hole meeting arguably the most significant in a decade, concludes Pozsar.

"Jes Staley: the last man in European investment banking","After Deutsche’s retreat, Barclays is the continent’s only bank with global ambitions","Following Deutsche Bank’s dramatic retreat, there is now just one European investment bank that hopes to remain a global force: Barclays. “The world doesn’t want to see just US investment banks,” said Jes Staley, the American chief executive of Barclays. “Being reliant only on the US financial industry is just not prudent.” Mr Staley, who used to run JPMorgan’s investment bank, has staked his tenure at Barclays on protecting this part of the business against an attack from activist investor Ed Bramson. But the future of Barclays’ investment bank, which has struggled with poor returns, is not yet guaranteed. It depends on whether it can win business relinquished by Deutsche, while also boosting profitability and taking market share from larger US rivals such as JPMorgan.  In an interview at the company’s London headquarters, Mr Staley told the Financial Times he remained confident Barclays’ investment bank would prevail, arguing that clients want to give a chunk of their business to a group that is based outside the US.  In the near term, Mr Staley said Barclays could benefit from Deutsche’s exit from equities trading in Europe, a business where few banks turn a profit. “We will get more volumes through the same cost base . . . we’re going to gain market share.” Some competitors agree. “The demise of Deutsche was a good day for Jes Staley,” said an executive at a rival.  However, analysts at Citi recently noted that Deutsche’s share of global equities trading was just 4 per cent, and that it was “likely to be spread thinly between competitors”. Mr Staley said Barclays’ equity capital markets (ECM) business — which handles initial public offerings and share sales for companies — is now “the only place where we are underperforming” in terms of market share. According to data from Refinitiv, Barclays ranked eighth for global equity transactions in the year to August 2, behind the five big US investment banks and UBS and Credit Suisse. It was third for global debt transactions, number six in global IPOs and number seven in terms of estimated investment banking fees.  Although Mr Staley can point to successes in ECM, such as the bank’s role as a lead book runner on the recent flotation of Change Healthcare on Nasdaq, Mr Staley said Barclays needs to lead more IPOs.  To that end, the bank has recently hired Kristin DeClark from Deutsche, who Mr Staley described as “the best ECM banker in Silicon Valley” and Taylor Wright from Morgan Stanley. Deutsche has insisted that it can revive its struggling ECM business even as it shuts its equities trading unit, prompting scepticism from rival banks who claim that operating a sales and trading division is critical to managing an IPO.  Mr Staley said it is “impossible” for a bank to lead an IPO without also having a secondary trading operation. “You have to control the first couple of days of trading, you have to use your own capital, and you have to have relationships on the street.” Barclays has a significant presence in equities trading in Europe, and New York, thanks to its acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ capital markets business during the financial crisis. But the bank closed down its cash equities business in Asia in 2016, a decision that Mr Staley said was taken due to “cost pressures at the time”. He said that the bank could one day re-enter Asian equities trading. “It may be the first part of our strategic restructuring that we reverse.” And he warned that pulling out of the US would be an irreversible error. “If you drop out of New York, you’ll never get back in.” If Deutsche does manage to win more ECM mandates without also operating an equities trading unit, it could prompt calls for Barclays and others to follow suit. Indeed, the German bank’s radical restructuring has broad implications for Barclays. If it succeeds, Mr Bramson might be able to revive his floundering activist campaign for Barclays to shrink its investment bank.  Mr Bramson, who controls 5.48 per cent of Barclays shares via his Sherborne Investors vehicle, suffered a heavy defeat in his attempt to force his way on to the bank’s board at its annual meeting in May. At the time, he agreed to a ceasefire, saying he wanted to give Nigel Higgins, the bank’s incoming chairman, some time to boost returns.  However, one person briefed on Mr Bramson’s plans said he is not preparing a full-scale retreat: “His resolve has not changed at all.”  Mr Staley noted that just 3.8 per cent of investors backed Mr Bramson’s effort to secure a board seat but conceded that there was still a “question” over whether the bank is “executing well enough”.  However, he said that further cuts to trading operations were not the answer and pointed out that Barclays had already shed £100bn of risk-weighted assets, sold more than 20 businesses and pulled out of several countries.  “We’re not there yet, in part because of the surgery of cutting off all those businesses,” he added. “You’d have to be missing your targets dramatically to embrace such an extraordinary strategic pivot.” Even if Mr Bramson is ultimately unsuccessful, several other large shareholders harbour doubts about whether Barclays should operate a full-scale global investment bank.  “The vote at the annual meeting was less about support for Barclays and more about Bramson not articulating anything different,” said one top 30 shareholder. “We want to see some movement on . . . the strategy around the investment bank.”  Whether Mr Staley can settle the doubts hinges on whether he can improve poor returns at the bank’s corporate and investment bank, which he must if he is to hit Barclays’ overall profitability target: a return on tangible equity of more than 9 per cent this year and 10 per cent in 2020. The figure last year was 8.5 per cent. Excluding a one-off gain from the sale of its stake in a trading business, corporate and investment banking generated a return of roughly 7.5 per cent in the second quarter, versus 9.5 per cent in the quarter before and 9.1 per cent a year ago. That was well below its international cards and payments business — 17.9 per cent — and its UK bank with a 12.7 per cent return.  Mr Staley pointed out that returns at the CIB division had improved substantially compared with two years ago, when they were between 3 and 4 per cent. But Mr Higgins, the new chairman, will not accept current profitability levels for long, predicts one Barclays executive. “Jes has five or six quarters to improve returns. Nigel will not let Bramson do the job; if it looks like Bramson will win, he will wield the knife,” the executive said. Mr Staley recently increased his control of the investment bank following the ousting of Tim Throsby, a freewheeling trader who sparred with other executives over whether the bank’s profitability targets were achievable.  Since then, Mr Staley has also exerted a tighter grip on costs, including a 23 per cent reduction in the amount the bank set aside for bonuses in the first half of this year. He insists he can be disciplined about pay without prompting an exodus of top traders, noting that attrition in its markets division is “significantly down” at a time of poor job prospects in the industry.  “It’s my belief that the talented people here recognise the importance of the profitability of the bank,” he said.

"ABN Amro steps up efforts to secure US banking licence","Dutch group aims to strengthen presence despite downsizing by European rivals","ABN Amro is gearing up to apply for a US banking licence in a move that will take the Dutch bank deeper into a market where its European peers have long struggled with poor profits and intrusive regulation.   ABN — which employs about 500 people in New York — will file an application with US regulators as soon as it completes a preparatory process with local regulators in Europe and the Netherlands, two people familiar with the situation told the FT.  “The US is an important market for us,” said one of the people. “We’re there with clearing, energy financing, commodity finance . . . Since our activities are reaching a certain scale, we are aiming for a branch.”  The people said the main purpose of the US entity was to give ABN better access to dollar funding, which would improve its dollar liquidity by making it easier for the Dutch lender to raise dollar funding and lend that to clients. The bank’s desire to strengthen its US presence follows years of downsizing by other European banks that already have locally-licensed branches in the US. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are the two most prominent examples; both have made big cuts to their Wall Street investment banks and further cuts are expected in the proposed Deutsche-Commerzbank merger.  Some European banks including Banco Santander and Deutsche Bank have also struggled with the annual US stress tests, which the Federal Reserve applies to banks with more than $50bn of assets. The ABN entity is likely to fall below that $50bn threshold.  ABN’s US business spans clearing, trade and commodity finance, natural resources, corporate finance, structured finance and global markets. It does not have, or intend to create, a retail banking offering, which will save it from some regulatory burdens.  The bank originally filed a licence application in the summer of 2017 and withdrew it last October, a January bulletin from the Federal Reserve said.  The application was withdrawn because ABN had to first obtain certain approvals from its home regulators, the Dutch National Bank and the European Central Bank, before proceeding with its US application. Once they are through ABN plans to reapply for a US licence. The DNB and ECB both declined to comment, as did a spokesman for ABN Amro.","26.03.2019"
"Stocks to watch: TalkTalk, Deutsche Bank, Electrolux, Rentokil","Intertek’s China optimism disconnects with peers, says Jefferies","Friday 14:00 GMT Here’s what’s happening ● TalkTalk led the FTSE 250 fallers after cutting full-year profit guidance. The internet provider reduced its target range for earnings before earnings, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to between £235m and £245m, from £261m previously, to reflect investment and restructuring costs including up to £10m more in the FibreNation venture.  Third-quarter results from TalkTalk showed revenue growth of 2.9 per cent and the addition of 44,000 broadband customers, but average revenue per user weakened 2 per cent. “Management say they are comfortable with full-year 2020 ebitda consensus estimates, but the market is understandably concerned given numerous downgrades in recent years,” said Morgan Stanley. ● Deutsche Bank fell after its fourth-quarter earnings showed a €261m loss rather than the €11m profit expected. Revenue from the corporate and investment banking (CIB) division was the problem, with underlying revenues from the Fixed Income & Currencies unit down 42 per cent quarter on quarter to hit the lowest level since 2008. “Although management has delivered on costs and balance sheet reduction, this seems to have come at the expense of revenues. The bank still appears to be losing CIB market share, which we fear will continue. Consequently we expect to see low-single digit consensus EPS [earnings per share] downgrades.”Citigroup ● Electrolux of Sweden surged after announcing plans to spin off its professional appliances division in 2020 with a demerger. The company also delivered fourth-quarter results that were slightly above consensus expectations.  “We see this as a positive step that creates value for shareholders as Professional is viewed as a higher quality business whose attractive features have historically not been fully valued as part of the low-margin consumer appliance business.”JPMorgan Cazenove Electrolux Professional has delivered SKr8.7bn in annual revenue at a pre-tax profit margin of around 13 per cent, with organic growth running at 4 per cent since 2014. JPMorgan said if the division was valued at between 12 and 13 times earnings it would be worth SKr50 to SKr55 per Electrolux share on a debt-free basis. The remaining consumer business would only look good value if Electrolux can convince investors that a 6 per cent group margin target could be achieved even without Professional, which would support a price for the rump of SKr230 per share, it said. Sellside stories ● Citigroup upgraded Rentokil Initial, the pest control group, to “buy” from “neutral” with a 400p target price. The “market is underestimating the returns Rentokil is enjoying from industry consolidation, a key part of management’s strategy”, it said.  Rentokil’s mergers and acquisitions since 2013 have generated a return on capital employed of 14.6 per cent, Citi estimated, adding: “We admire their M&A track record, delivering double-digit returns and solid top-line growth with margin expansion.” Citi also welcomed an improvement in Rentokil’s cash performance, which had suffered historically from bad debtors, exceptionals and provisioning. Cash conversion of 85 per cent beats the business sector’s 68 per cent average and looks sustainable, with room for further improvement, it said. While Rentokil’s valuation of 24 times 2019 earnings reflects strong demand for pest control companies, the stock’s enterprise value is no more than on par with the business services sector based on 2020 operating earnings, suggesting a sharp discount to peers if management can deliver on targets, Citi said. ● Peel Hunt upgraded Plus500 to “add” from “hold” with a £16.50 target price in a post-results review of the UK-listed financial bookmakers. It retained “buy” advice on CMC Markets and IG Group. Trading platforms trade at a deep discount to comparable listed businesses despite similar characteristics, with enterprise values of between 4.5 times earnings for Plus500 to 8.2 times for IG Group compared with a broad peer group on an average of 19 times earnings, Peel Hunt said. “We are positive on this sector given our expectation of a consolidating market and the strong cash generation.” ● Jefferies downgraded Intertek, the product-testing specialist, to “hold” from “buy”. Uncertainty around tariffs between the US and China has probably caused a slowdown in investment that may accelerate, it said. “There has been a disconnect in messaging around outlook for the consumer division between Intertek and the other main peers Bureau Veritas and SGS. The latter two companies have been messaging some caution for the first half 2019 while Intertek has remained more relaxed about the impact. While Intertek’s products division now houses a lot more than just consumer products, we estimate softlines, hardlines and electronics is circa 50 per cent of the division. The China testing part is a high-margin activity within a high-margin part of that division.”Jefferies ● In brief: ADO Properties cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; AB InBev rated new “hold” at Société Générale; Adidas cut to “neutral” at UBS; Carlsberg rated new “buy” at Société Générale; Close Brothers downgraded to “sell” at Citigroup; DSM upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Daimler raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Deutsche Wohnen cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Elisa downgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Heineken rated new “buy” at Société Générale; Logista cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Maisons du Monde upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Mediaset cut to “underweight” at Barclays; Novo Nordisk reinstated “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; SIF Holding upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Siemens Gamesa upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Siltronic cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Suez downgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Symrise raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Vonovia upgraded to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Wacker Chemie cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"Chinese coffee start-up Luckin files for US IPO","Plans come just days after raising $150m from investors in its latest funding round","Luckin Coffee, the Chinese coffee start-up trying to open up more outlets on the mainland than Starbucks, plans to list in the US in what is shaping up as a banner year for US IPOs. The group filed paperwork with US regulators just days after it raised $150m from investors, including US asset manager BlackRock, in a funding round that valued the company at $2.9bn. Monday’s filing did not contain details on the number of shares to be sold in the IPO or the proposed price. The fresh cash comes as the company pushes to overtake Starbucks by number of outlets in China. Luckin said last year it plans to open 200 to 300 outlets a month, putting it on track to overtake Starbucks, which has more than 3,300 locations in China, by the end of this year. Luckin joins a growing list of companies lining up to go public in the US this year. On Monday, Beyond Meat, a California-based company that makes vegan burgers, launched an IPO that could value that company at more than $1bn while Silicon Valley giant Uber is aiming to list next month after rival Lyft went public in March and Pinterest, the online scrapbooking site, priced its IPO last week. Luckin’s core business is delivery and takeaway coffee, and unlike Starbucks many of its stores do not have seating, allowing it to expand more rapidly. Citing Frost & Sullivan, the company said it is China’s second largest and fastest-growing coffee network in terms of number of stores and cups of coffee sold. However, the start-up still had only 2.1 per cent of China’s specialist coffee and tea shop market last year, according to consultancy Euromonitor, compared to nearly 51 per cent for Starbucks. Alongside the public offer, Luckin will also sell shares in a private placement to Louis Dreyfus, which has teamed up with it on a joint venture for building and operating a coffee roasting plant in China. Since inception in June 2017, the company has expanded from one store in Beijing to 2,370 stores in 28 cities in China as of end-March, with more than 16.8m transacting customers and a customer repurchase rate in 2018 of more than 54 per cent. Last year, Luckin had net revenue of Rmb840.7m ($125.3m) compared with Rmb250,000 in 2017 with a net loss widening to Rmb1.6bn last year from Rmb56.4m. For the first three months of 2019, net revenue was Rmb478.5m, up from about Rmb13m a year ago, with a net loss of Rmb551.8, up from Rmb132.2m. Guo Jinyi, co-founder and senior vice-president at Luckin, told the Financial Times last year the company was not focused on profitability in the short term. It continues to offer heavy discounts to new customers as it seeks to gain market share from established players. Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, CICC and Haitong International will be underwriters on the offering. Once the IPO is complete, the company will trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “LK”.

"Stocks to watch: Metro Bank, Sanne, Ingenico, Tesla, G4S, Forterra","Pandora’s bloated store network needs radical surgery, says RBC","Wednesday 13:00 GMT What’s happening ● Metro Bank suffered its worst fall on record after warning that changes to its treatment of property loans meant risk-weighted assets had ballooned 20 per cent. The warning led investors to expect another rights issue to shore up regulatory capital. Metro said it was carrying £8.9bn in risk-weighted assets due to net loan growth and “an adjustment in the risk-weighting of certain commercial loans secured on property and certain specialist buy-to-let loans to large portfolio landlords”. The model change followed an internal review by auditors. The lender also reported sequentially slowing deposit growth for the fourth quarter and said full-year earnings would be £50m, compared with a £59m market consensus. There was no detail given on its common equity tier one (CET1) capital, the key gauge of balance sheet strength, which analysts estimated had been eroded to about 13 per cent.  “The increased capital allocation throws into question the commerciality of such lending and the impact on growth for Metro Bank. Moreover, given the hit to capital and our expectation that the CET1 ratio will continue to fall till FY2020 as the group’s profitability will remain lower than capital consumption, we believe that another equity increase is now more likely this year.”Panmure Gordon ● Sanne tumbled on the surprise retirement of Dean Godwin, its chief executive since 2012. Martin Schnaier, the fund administration specialist’s chief commercial officer since 2017, was named as his successor. ● Ingenico dropped on a profit warning. The French payments processor blamed continued poor sales of point-of-sale terminals in Europe and a slow rollout of its recently launched Axium system. Fourth-quarter results from Ingenico also disappointed, with operating earnings coming in below consensus forecasts due to weak sales in higher margin developed markets.  Sellside stories ● RBC downgraded Tesla to “underperform” from “sector perform” with a $245 target price. While Tesla’s “more tactful” approach to messaging was a long-term positive, it would put pressure on growth expectations that were already too high to justify the current valuation, it said.  “For years, Tesla sold the dream of transportation disruption and fantastic growth. This served the stock well, turning Tesla into a top six (at times top 3) valuable auto [maker] despite delivering a fraction of units of others and nary a profit. But the rubber appears to be hitting the road as the realities of Tesla becoming a volume player, the challenges to scale and deliver high volume at high average selling prices and margins are coming to a head.”RBC From recent price cuts and job losses to language around full self-driving, Tesla’s commentary and actions appeared more realistic, said RBC, adding: “This is likely to cause a review of model assumptions leading to negative expectation revisions.” The decision to drop the price of a Model 3 sedan by $2,000 “confirms our view that the bulk of demand is at a lower price point that Tesla can’t access yet profitably”, RBC said. “At the end of the day, Tesla is trying to manage luxury profitability levels towards volume units. We believe this will prove difficult.” Tesla can deliver solid growth over time. But even with 1m units sold in 2025 at an average price of $55,000 and a 12 per cent profit margin, with no increase in interest costs and no equity raise, the discounted value of the stock would still only be $195 based on a valuation of 15 times earnings at maturity, said RBC. It referred to at least a third of Tesla’s current price as an “Elon premium”.   ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded G4S to “neutral” from “overweight”. Its move followed G4S being ordered by a US court to pay between $100m and $130m as a result of a class-action settlement in California relating to employees’ meal and rest breaks. The maximum fine would increase G4S’s net debt to 2.4 times 2019 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, meaning management would make very little progress in reducing leverage this year, said JPMorgan. “While we make no material estimates changes, global growth is slowing and wage growth is continuing to ramp up, hence we see the fundamentals for the company as somewhat weaker than at the time of our November note,” added the broker, which advised clients to take profit. ● Exane BNP Paribas upgraded CRH and Forterra to “outperform” and cut Ferguson to “underperform” in a review of the European building materials makers. “The sell-off has left some names looking deeply undervalued given their growth prospects, even if macro visibility is low,” Exane said. Its annual industry survey suggested pricing power for cement makers was better in developed markets than in emerging markets, with the broker predicting US margins would surprise positively this year. Investors should therefore increase exposure to US aggregate makers in preference to those reliant on China, Latin America and the Middle East, such as LafargeHolcim and Titan Cement, it said.  Exane saw pent-up demand for infrastructure in the US and Europe “as the agenda shifts from austerity to growth” and said that developed-economy housing markets were slowing rather than deteriorating. CRH would benefit from strong US margins while Forterra, the UK brick-maker, looked undervalued given a tight market and high barriers to entry, the broker said. Its downgrade of Ferguson reflected worries that the US home renovation market was slowing, as reflected by the recent profit warning from paintmaker Sherwin-Williams. ● RBC downgraded Pandora, the Danish jewellery maker, to “underperform” from “sector perform” based on geospatial analysis of its stores in the UK and Germany. It said that too many openings had diluted the brand and eroded pricing power, which no longer matched the intended customer base. “Pandora’s store distribution footprint is overextended owing to prolific openings and conversions towards high visibility, branded concept stores in average or below-average locations, driving up saturation and driving down desirability which is problematic for a jewellery brand that generates three-quarters of revenues in a gifting scenario.”RBC With Pandora’s footfall declining and management seeking to reduce its reliance on promotions this year, volumes are likely to suffer, said RBC, which called for a “more revolutionary” approach. It added: “We believe a product, price, brand rethink is required, coupled with expectations rebased to address the overextended business model and deal with brand saturation.” ● In brief: AIB upgraded to “outperform” at Davy; Baloise upgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Centrica cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Cineworld rated “buy” at Jefferies; Daimler upgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Equinor cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Euronav upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Euskaltel rated “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Geberit rated “underperform” at Exane; Henkel downgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; Kloeckner upgraded to “buy” at UBS; Logitech raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Masmovil rated “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Mediawan rated “outperform” at Exane; OMV cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; PGS upgraded to “buy” at Société Générale; Saipem raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Schindler rated “outperform” at Exane; SGS downgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; SIG Combibloc rated “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Thales cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse.

"Stocks to watch: Boeing, Cairn, OneSavings, Pandora, Keir, Tele2","US slowdown makes Experian look too expensive, says Deutsche","Monday 14:30 GMT What’s happening ● Boeing was heading for its biggest loss since September 2001 following the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday, which killed all 157 people on board. The Boeing B737 Max 8 aircraft lost contact six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa. Investors drew parallels with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October, which involved the same type of aircraft and happened shortly after take-off. Similarities between the two crashes were hard to ignore, said analysts.  “Both crashes were relatively new Max 8 models, both were operated by experienced airlines with good safety records, the pilots of both aircraft were experienced, and both pilots noted problems shortly after take-off,” said Buckingham Research Group, which added: “The initial reaction from investors could be to assume the B737 Max 8 fleet is grounded, that deliveries are delayed, and inventory builds until a fix can be designed and installed.” Investigators on the Lion Air crash have focused on the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, on suspicions that it fed false readings from a sensor into the flight control system. The worst-case scenario for Boeing would be if the Ethiopian crash was caused by a totally new flight control system problem unrelated to the MCAS system, as the whole B737 fleet may be grounded and deliveries suspended for two to four months, said Buckingham. It estimated that the B737 provided about 15 per cent of Boeing’s total cash flow. ● Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank rallied on reports that talks between the lenders on a potential merger had intensified, with support in principle from stakeholders including the German government. Deutsche’s management board was said to have agreed to hold talks with Commerzbank on the feasibility of a merger. Analysts saw Commerzbank as better placed in the talks, particularly if Deutsche gets pressured into raising additional capital as part of any rights issue to finance the acquisition.  “For Deutsche we would see the fact that it is willing to hold talks now as an admission that improving returns on a standalone basis has become more challenging. Given the high gearing of both Deutsche and Commerzbank to higher interest rates in Europe, the delay of the rate rise by the ECB last week was unhelpful.”RBC ● Cairn Energy was a faller after the arbitration panel judging its $1.4bn tax dispute with the Indian government said that, due to workload, it was unable to give guidance on the expected timing for a decision. Cairn said it saw little chance of a judgment before late 2019. A victory for Cairn would potentially be worth 193p per share, according to Citigroup, which added: “While the news is clearly disappointing given it was a material near-term catalyst, the merits and strengths of Cairn’s case remain unchanged.” ● OneSavings Bank and Charter Court jumped after the UK buy-to-let mortgage lenders set out plans for an all-share merger. The terms of the deal would see OneSavings investors take 55 per cent of the enlarged group. “The businesses are a mirror image of each other and would be a good fit with potential for some cost synergies . . . The merger will create a leading specialist mortgage lender in the UK with greater scale and resources to deploy on growth opportunities, hence we think this deal is very good for OneSavings shareholders.”Panmure Gordon ● Kier, the UK construction group, slumped after correcting its net debt position at the 2018 year end from £130m to £180.5m. The company made the adjustments to reflect hedging activities and the reclassification of £40.2m of net debt relating to assets held for resale. Separately, Kier booked a £25m provision on a UK hospital contract to cover future recoveries “The announcement further dents management’s credibility following December’s surprise rights issue, and is a backward step in rebuilding confidence in the group’s balance sheet position.”Stifel Sellside stories ● Deutsche Bank downgraded Experian, the credit-checking agency, to “sell” from “hold” with an £18 target price. Experian’s US business, which generates about 60 per cent of group sales, last year saw the benefit of a strong economy as well as new products and a data breach at main rival Equifax, said Deutsche. But there were signs the US economy was slowing with delinquencies beginning to edge up and sequential weakness in areas such as temporary labour, it said. And with Experian trading at an all-time high valuation of about 25 times 2019 earnings, the slowdown had not been priced in, Deutsche said. “Once growth starts slowing for the cycle, it is likely to keep on slowing until we enter a recession, and, as such, we believe the stock should start to see a de-rating now . . . We continue to see Experian as a high-quality company with high barriers to entry, but we regard the stock as overvalued for the changing growth outlook.”Deutsche Bank ● Carnegie downgraded Pandora, the Denmark-based jewellery retailer, to “sell” from “hold” with a DK325 target. It cited indications of slowing growth in China, persistently weak demand in Europe and US “channel stuffing” — filling the distribution channels with excess product. Carnegie added that its target price may be optimistic if upcoming quarterly results confirm a China slowdown. ● In brief: Bodycote cut to “sell” at Stifel; Boliden cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Deutsche Pfandbriefbank downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Eurazeo raised to “buy” at Société Générale; Galp cut to “underweight” at JPMorgan; Givaudan cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; IAG upgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Lufthansa raised to “buy” at Goodbody; Redde cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Rocket Internet rated new “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; SIG upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Swissquote cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Tele2 upgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Wacker Chemie upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse.

"Office group IWG shifts towards franchises in Japanese sale","£320m deal maintains the group’s brand as rivalry in co-work spaces steps up","IWG is planning to sell “pretty much all” of its business after a franchising deal in Japan signalled a shift in strategy for the world’s largest serviced office group that sent its shares up by almost a quarter. The Switzerland-based group, previously known as Regus, agreed to sell its Japanese business for £320m in cash to TKP, a Tokyo-listed provider of rented conference rooms and banquet halls. The two companies will enter into a franchise arrangement — that is likely to be replicated in other parts of the business — in which TKP will operate the 130 flexible working centres in Japan using IWG’s brands.  Mark Dixon, IWG chief executive, said the serviced office group was in discussions with a number of franchise partners around the world, and “would expect over time pretty much all” of the company to be up for sale.  “IWG will become more valuable without its assets than with its assets,” he said.   The office industry has been shaken by the growth of SoftBank-backed WeWork, which spent $2.5bn expanding its global business last year, according to documents seen by the Financial Times this month.  IWG reported a fall in profit last year, partly because of the cost of increasing and reshaping its portfolio in response to the expansion of WeWork, which offers perks that include beer on tap.   Talks last year with several potential buyers for the whole of IWG failed to bear fruit. IWG said in March that it was considering selling its Spaces business, a shared office rival to WeWork.  Mr Dixon said IWG hoped to expand to 30,000 locations, up tenfold from today’s number. “By partnering we will get there more quickly, and without our own balance sheet,” he said.  Shares in the company rose nearly 23 per cent on Monday to take gains for the year to 65 per cent. Mr Dixon, who has long claimed the business is undervalued, said the deal allowed investors to assess the company more effectively. IWG’s market capitalisation is about £3bn, compared with its rival WeWork’s recent valuation of $47bn. 
 US investment bank Stifel said the Japanese sale was at an equivalent to 15.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The bank said if the deal’s numbers were applied across IWG, it would suggest a valuation of about £6bn.  Peel Hunt said it expected more sales to follow, “which should further validate the new strategy, release substantial value and lead to a complete reappraisal of the company”. But, while welcoming the move, Credit Suisse analysts cautioned that the effects of mixed economic forecasts could hit the franchising shift and slow down the wider office industry. The market in London’s office space has recently shown signs of strain. Mr Dixon said the UK market was “not easy”, while total demand for London office buildings has dropped over the past three years. ","15.04.2019"
"UBS fined £28m by FCA for misreporting 136m transactions","Penalty is largest ever from UK regulator over transaction-reporting breaches","UBS has been fined a record £27.6m by the UK’s financial watchdog for misreporting 136m transactions over nearly a decade. It is the largest  fine levied by the Financial Conduct Authority for transaction-reporting breaches — more than double the previous record. In 2005, the Swiss bank was fined £100,000 for similar shortcomings. UBS failed to ensure that complete and accurate information on 87m transactions was sent to the regulator, which uses the details to try to spot market abuse, insider dealing and market manipulation, the FCA said on Tuesday. It also reported nearly 50m transactions that it did not need to. “Firms must have proper systems and controls to identify what transactions they have carried out, on what markets, at what price, in what quantity and with whom,” said Mark Steward, the FCA’s executive director of enforcement. “If firms cannot report their transactions accurately, fundamental risks arise, including the risk that market abuse may be hidden.” The bank qualified for a 30 per cent discount on a fine that would otherwise have been nearly £40m because management co-operated with the investigation, it self-reported the majority of the failings and swiftly agreed to the penalty. A spokeswoman said it is already fully provisioned for the fine. “In recent years the FCA has invested heavily to develop market surveillance technology, but that is reliant on firms providing good quality data,” said Jamie Symington, a former top FCA lawyer who is now a partner in Brown Rudnick’s global white collar crime and regulatory investigations group. “The record size of the fine demonstrates the high expectations it has of firms.” The FCA investigation found UBS had not put adequate systems and controls in place, failed to update them as the industry changed and used poor testing practices to ensure reports were accurate. This breached European Mifid I regulations, which were superseded by stricter rules in January 2018. The regulator sent teams into UBS periodically during the time in question — November 2007 to May 2017 — which found “the complexity of the systems architecture used by UBS to support both its trading activity and its transaction reporting increased the risks”.  For example, the bank ran multiple trading systems to book and settle transactions instead of using a unified one. Errors in its IT automation code also resulted in many trades being miscategorised. Some of the types of transactions misreported, or not reported at all, include equity derivatives, trades for portfolio managers and prop traders, and credit default swaps. The bank was found to have used incorrect buy/sell indicators on 1.5m transactions and reported another 2m using the wrong venue of execution.  “We are pleased to have resolved this Mifid I legacy matter,” UBS said. “Although there was never any impact on clients, investors or market users, the bank has made significant investments to enhance its transaction reporting systems and controls.” UBS joins 12 other banks that the FCA has fined for their Mifid transaction reporting, including Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse and Barclays.","19.03.2019"
"Chinese conglomerate HNA faces loss of assets after default","Canary Wharf buildings among properties that could be seized after missed HK$63m payment","Chinese airline-to-finance conglomerate HNA Group faces the loss of assets, including buildings at London’s Canary Wharf to creditors, after a missed interest payment that marks its first default on international liabilities. CWT International, a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of cash-strapped HNA, said yesterday it had failed to pay interest payments and fees on a HK$1.4bn ($179m) loan, prompting lenders to demand the subsidiary repay the full loan and interest or risk the loss of almost all of its remaining assets. The missed payment also triggered a cross-default on a separate HK$766m loan owed by a subsidiary of CWT.  Bankers and lawyers have long expressed concern that HNA’s complex financing structure and pledges across subsidiaries leave it vulnerable to a chain of defaults.  HNA has navigated a series of liquidity crises as it tries to pay off at least $80bn in debt. So far, it has taken pains to meet any international obligations, while defaulting on products sold to individual Chinese investors and employees, and narrowly succeeding in paying off some domestic bonds.  Creditors are seeking assets including the Canary Wharf office buildings, golf courses in China and investment properties in the US, after CWT failed to pay interest and fees of approximately HK$63m due to lenders under the HK$1.4bn facility agreement.  In the past two years HNA has sold more than $40bn in assets to trim a debt pile twice that size. However, the more it sells, the fewer revenue-producing assets remain to settle outstanding loans. Brexit uncertainties have meant HNA has had “a challenge identifying interested buyers” for the Canary Wharf buildings at 17 Columbus Courtyard and 30 South Colonnade, the company said in March. They are occupied by Credit Suisse and by Reuters, which plans to move out next year.  CWT said its lenders would take possession of all assets pledged as collateral if the company does not repay the outstanding amount by 9am Hong Kong local time today. The subsidiary said the assets represented the “vast majority” of its total holdings, which it said were valued at HK$24.6bn at the end of 2018. CWT, which was formerly known as HNA International Investment Holdings, last year sold warehouse properties in Singapore for $539m. It acquired the warehouses in 2017 when it bought CWT International, a Singaporean logistics company whose name it subsequently adopted. Trading in its Hong Kong-listed shares has been suspended since April 10. According to the company’s 2018 financial statement, it borrowed $561m in 2017 to buy CWT, which it paid down thanks to the warehouse sale and a HK$1.4bn loan that is due in October this year. It said it would not be able to repay the HK$1.4bn unless it was able to refinance it.  Additional reporting by Archie Zhang in Beijing

"Is it time to declare the end of globalisation?","Two books try to make sense of what has gone wrong — but ignore the successes of emerging markets","Globalisation is coming undone. Once thought unstoppable, the forces of liberalisation that spurred many decades of rising cross-border trade are faltering. And while President Donald Trump’s policies are hardly helping, this malaise of interconnectedness appears more profound than any mere trade war. Flows of overseas direct investment have fallen to levels not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis. Trade restrictions are rising. Genuine multinational companies — meaning those that earn at least a quarter of their revenue abroad — are less numerous and profitable than before. Rather than a free-spirited zone for unfettered communication, the internet is growing Balkanised, brought to heel by autocrats. Even those who once pushed globalisation as a force for prosperity admit that things have gone badly awry. Two new books try to make sense of what has gone wrong, examining the benefits that global integration was supposed to bring and the many social and political tensions it created instead. The Levelling by Michael O’Sullivan, a veteran banker at Credit Suisse, offers stark conclusions. “Globalisation, at least in the form that people have come to enjoy it, is defunct,” he writes. “It may well be better that those who have grown fond of globalisation get over it [and] accept its passing.”  The causes of this collapse are familiar. Outsourcing hastened the decline of western manufacturing employment, and thus many of the communities that relied upon it. Movement of people across borders, both legally and illegally, spurred a populist cultural backlash, fuelled in turn by rising inequality. O’Sullivan suggests a deeper malaise, however, drawing ideas from the Putney debates, a series of gatherings in the aftermath of the English civil war in 1647, and often cited as an early inspiration for Britain’s later tradition of constitutional democracy. His titular “levelling” bounces off the Levellers, a group of proto-democrats who used those debates to push for radical social reforms. As globalisation retreats, he claims that much the same is needed today: “The contract people thought they had with politicians, governments, institutions, and potentially each other is disintegrating.” The second book, The Crisis of Globalization, brings together essays by thinkers on the political centre-left, edited by Patrick Diamond, a one-time adviser to Tony Blair, former UK prime minister, in exactly the period when many centrist politicians viewed globalisation as both positive and non-negotiable. Although this is not exactly a mea culpa, Diamond now firmly rejects this view. “Global capitalism no longer appears capable of generating broadly shared prosperity,” he writes. “Clinton and Blair’s refusal to confront the polarising forces of unfettered global capitalism is one of many reasons for the contemporary obsolescence of the progressive tradition.” Global capitalism no longer appears capable of generating broadly shared prosperity Both books are carefully argued, although neither spends much time talking about emerging markets, where globalisation’s record is arguably more successful, for instance in creating the economic conditions that allowed countries in emerging Asia to move hundreds of millions out of poverty. It is also possible to claim that globalisation’s reversal is in part a trick of the light. The kind of growth in physical goods that marked recent waves of globalisation is indeed slowing. But cross-border activity in other areas, for instance in knowledge services or flows of data, continues to expand, suggesting that new forms of cross-border integration can develop even as the traditional ones decline.  O’Sullivan, at least, disagrees with this, suggesting that globalisation of all stripes is set to retreat, reflecting the realities of a new multipolar world that is simply unable to sustain the kind of international institutions that once powered globalisation’s advance. This will have consequences: we must prepare for growth in the region of just 2 per cent, he predicts, barely half the rate of recent decades. A Chinese financial crash is likely too, representing “the logical end” of the series of debt-fuelled crises that hit both the US and Europe. All this could prompt a bloody collapse of the entire international system, as happened at the tail-end of an earlier period of globalisation in the early 20th century. More likely is a future in which existing global institutions seize up, beginning with the World Trade Organization, O’Sullivan suggests, possibly to be replaced by less effective ad hoc and regional groupings, from the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation Agreement to the so-called “Hanseatic League 2.0” of minor northern European powers. It may well be better that those who have grown fond of globalisation get over it [and] accept its passing Can anything be done to save some of globalisation’s good qualities? Leaders such as Blair once hoped investments in education and training might help people adapt to rapid economic change. More recently others have suggested measures to compensate globalisation’s “losers”. Neither approach has proved remotely effective or popular, which is why Diamond’s collection instead advocates what he calls a push for better “universal basic services” — meaning a much more generous menu of social support programmes, from healthcare and housing to transport and digital access, which might help people facing economic dislocation feel more secure. This sounds like a formulaic social democratic response. That is perhaps no bad thing, given that many of the countries that escaped the worst of the present globalisation backlash, from Canada to the Nordic states, follow something close to this model. Yet even were such measures to be affordable, they are unlikely to be enough to reverse the declining path of globalisation charted by both The Levelling and The Crisis of Globalization. International financiers and political moderates were once exactly the types who pushed the merits of integration. Now they come not to praise the passing era of “hyperglobalisation”, but to bury it.

The boost followed a trading update that the company was “materially ahead” of where it expected to be at this stage of the year. Despite today’s rally, shares are still down more than one-fifth from their recent peak early September 2018.  Following the update, Credit Suisse upgraded its projections for the company’s earnings per share by 4 per cent in 2019 and by 5 per cent in 2020. However, analysts noted that without more specific information from the company about expectations, it is difficult to extrapolate meaning from their announcement.","09.01.2019"
"Stocks to watch: BAT, GVC, Standard Life, Avast, Tesla, Boeing, IAG","Hunting has carved out a niche in fracking equipment, says Redburn","Wednesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● Cigarette makers British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands faded after the US Food and Drug Administration named National Cancer Institute director Ned Sharpless as acting commissioner to replace Scott Gottlieb, who announced plans to step down this month. “This reinforces our view that investors were premature to assume that Gottlieb’s departure would lead to a lighter regulatory hand over the tobacco industry out of Washington. It now appears the FDA will not skip a beat in its pursuit of tobacco regulations, and we continue to believe Congress will seek to become more involved in addressing the youth ecigarette epidemic during the months to come.”Height Securities Separately, BAT said it had put its Canadian subsidiary into insolvency administration. The subsidiary, Imperial Tobacco Canada, had been liable for a £5.2bn fine as part of a ruling against the tobacco industry in Quebec. Canada was estimated to contribute about 4 per cent of BAT’s underlying earnings.  Citigroup called BAT’s move a “necessary first step” as the industry seeks to settle claims on a national level, which will probably take many years. In the interim the Canadian subsidiary can continue to operate unaffected and BAT will continue to consolidate its revenue within the group, so “on the face of things, little will change”, the broker added.  But Citi highlighted that BAT was unlikely to be able to take cash out of Canada for the foreseeable future, affecting its ability to pay dividends and service debt. BAT has already taken a £436m charge to cover cash trapped on the Imperial Tobacco Canada balance sheet, with Citi estimating a further £600m at risk. ● Standard Life Aberdeen rallied to the top of the FTSE 100 gainers after delivering better than expected full-year results and dismantling its much-criticised management structure. The asset manager said Martin Gilbert, co-chief executive, would become group executive vice-chairman reporting to recently appointed chairman Sir Douglas Flint. Keith Skeoch, meanwhile, would remain as chief executive. The company also appointed Stephanie Bruce to replace Bill Rattray as chief finance officer. SLA added that it was committed to holding dividends flat at worst “during the period of transformation” and said it was ahead of schedule in delivering cost efficiencies. Full-year adjusted operating profit of £650m, down 1.6 per cent year on year, was 5 per cent ahead of the consensus forecast. ● GVC, the Ladbrokes owner, retreated after Germany proposed amendments to its Interstate Gambling Treaty with restrictions on in-play sports betting, including introducing a €1,000 monthly spending limit. State presidents will vote on the proposals on March 21.  Merrill Lynch estimated that Germany provides around 9 per cent of GVC’s group revenue, of which 55 per cent is casino betting and 45 per cent is sport. It also cited data from the German Sports Betting Association suggesting that in-play bets make up between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the market. ● Avast slipped to a one-month low on the surprise retirement of Vince Steckler, its chief executive for the past decade, little more than a year after the flotation of the antivirus software maker. He will be succeeded by Ondrej Vlcek, president of Avast’s consumer business and its chief operating officer between 2007 and 2013. Full-year results and 2019 guidance from Avast matched market expectations. ● Boeing edged higher in morning Wall Street trade as analysts urged for calm in the wake of Sunday’s crash of an Ethiopian Airlines B737 Max, the company’s most important jet in terms of product revenue and earnings. Shares in Boeing have fallen more than 10 per cent since the crash as airspace regulators in China, the UK and the EU grounded flights.  “There is no valid reason to suspect the cause of the Ethiopian crash renders the B737 Max unsafe — the cause of the Ethiopian Max crash could as easily be a mechanical fault as a flight control issue. We’re witnessing an unprecedented situation where politics is trumping science — not a good thing and not a sound reason to sell the stock. In a worst-case situation, we think the financial impact to Boeing is likely to be relatively small.”Buckingham Research Sellside stories ● Redburn started coverage of Hunting, the shale-oil equipment maker, with “buy” advice and a 12-month target price of 800p. Booming shale demand has not translated to oversized returns for oilfield services companies because the industry “has been serially undone by oversupply”, said Redburn. However, it saw Hunting’s flagship product, the perforating gun, as an exception. The precision aim provided by perforating guns help squeeze out well inefficiencies and improve the reach of fracking, it said. The broker also saw Hunting as the leading player among four niche manufacturers, with the technological gap between it and rivals widening.  “An attractive oilfield services end market should be exposed to structural, not simply cyclical, growth and should enjoy a consolidated supply side where innovation, rather than just capital, forms a barrier to entry. We find the perforating gun market to be such an industry.”Redburn ● Goldman Sachs repeated “sell” advice on Tesla with a $210 target price. It said to expect disappointing first-quarter results from the automaker. The slew of recent updates from Tesla point to weakening US demand for its higher-priced models following the phasing out of a federal tax credit, “and we believe moves by the company to continue to improve its cost structure in order to deliver lower-priced vehicles and tap remaining consumer demand corroborate this”, said Goldman. While the unveiling of Model Y might trigger incremental reservations and boost cash balances, there may be a knock-on effect to sales of the Model 3 “as consumers decide to wait a little longer to purchase a Tesla crossover vehicle”, said the broker.  Delays to international deliveries, weak demand at the higher end and the margin hit from a cheaper Model 3 will combine to cause a “meaningful working capital headwind” in the first quarter, resulting in Tesla’s end-of-quarter cash balance to be “closer to the $2bn mark”, from $3.88bn at the 2018 year end, said Goldman. ● In brief: Aena cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Banco Santander upgraded to “outperform” at RBC; Credit Suisse cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Endesa downgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Evonik raised to “hold” at HSBC; Freenet raised to “buy” at Jefferies; IAG upgraded to “outperform” at RBC; Ingenico raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Just Eat cut to “hold” at Investec; Kingfisher downgraded to “hold” at Stifel; Lonmin upgraded to “hold” at Renaissance Capital; Lookers cut to “hold” at N+1 Singer; On The Beach rated new “buy” at Liberum; Schindler cut to “equal weight” at Barclays and to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Sunrise Communications downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Umicore raised to “buy” at ING.

"AbbVie hopes Botox-maker Allergan can iron out its wrinkles","Pipeline failures and drugs coming off patent lead to tie-up of pharma companies","Two months ago, AbbVie chief executive Rick Gonzalez approached his counterpart at Allergan, Brent Saunders, with a proposition he believed could solve a series of problems facing their respective drug companies. The discussion culminated on Tuesday with the second blockbuster acquisition in the drug industry this year: AbbVie would buy Allergan in a cash-and-stock deal that valued its shares at $63bn before the addition of about $20bn in net debt.  For Mr Saunders, a serial dealmaker who had pieced together Allergan through a succession of takeovers, the deal provided relief from a tumbling share price and attacks from a hedge fund pushing to divide his chief executive and chairman roles.  Once the darling of stock market investors, Allergan’s fall from grace meant that the sale at an enterprise value of $83bn equates to roughly half the value of its previously agreed deal to sell itself to Pfizer back in late 2015.  That transaction, which was worth $160bn, would have allowed Pfizer to redomicile to Ireland by merging into Allergan and allow the US drugmaker to escape US taxes. The move was blocked by changes in tax policy by the Obama administration and in hindsight marked the high-water mark of Mr Saunders tenure.  Since then, Allergan — best known for its cosmetic drug Botox — has been struggling to keep pace with Wall Street’s thirst for growth. The business was pummelled by a series of pipeline failures that pushed shares to multiyear lows, leading to calls for the company to consider a break-up. The 45 per cent premium paid by AbbVie only values Allergan at levels it was trading at last August.  For Mr Gonzalez, whose shares plunged 15 per cent after the deal was announced, the threat to AbbVie had been clear for years. Its blockbuster drug, Humira, which treats autoimmune diseases, has allowed company to print money — but for a finite period. Accounting for 60 per cent of AbbVie’s $33bn in annual sales, it will go off patent in the US in 2023, all the while facing increased competition from rivals who are developing generic versions. How to find sources to replenish those sales once the tick lower was a source of constant consternation.  “Humira is essentially buying the assets that replace it over the long term,” Mr Gonzalez said in a call with analysts on Tuesday.   Another person close to the talks said: “This gives the company an insurance policy and Humira itself will pay down the debt.” The new group, which would sit close to rivals Pfizer and Novartis in terms of revenues, will retain an important presence in immunology — with Humira and Skyrizi — hematologic oncology — with Imbruvica and Venclexta — and virology — with drugs used to treat hepatitis C — among other areas.  Humira, whose sales AbbVie projects will stay stable at $19bn a year, will generate cash flow that will be used to pay down the enormous debt that is required to fund the deal. It will also help AbbVie try to mine Allergan’s own pipeline of drugs for new products. AbbVie hopes that its global sales force will also help bolster Botox revenues.  The deal is only the latest tactic from Abbvie to offset the end of the Humira cash machine. After having its own deal to move to Ireland — through a 2014 takeover of Shire — blocked by policy changes from the Obama administration, the Chicago-based company has looked elsewhere.  It spent $21bn on Pharmacyclics in 2015, and then bought Stemcentrix for just under $10bn. 
 The rise of Allergan, meanwhile, was masterminded by Mr Saunders. A former Bausch & Lomb executive, the 49-year-old built Allergan through a succession of deals that began in 2013 when the company he ran, then called Actavis, bought Ireland-headquartered Warner Chilcott.   That deal paved the way for the company to relocate its tax base away from the US and led ultimately to the $66bn takeover of Allergan, where Mr Saunders adopted the target’s name and remained in charge.  However, pressure on the company eventually led Wall Street analysts to discuss the possibility of a break-up. The company floated plans to sell its women’s health and infectious diseases businesses in a bid to raise $6bn. It is likely the company was on the radar of potential acquirers for a while because of the expected longevity of its aesthetics business, analysts at Credit Suisse said. There could also be a fiscal motivation behind the acquisition. The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 gave incentives for the tax-efficient repatriation of cash that had previously been piling up offshore, said Michael Levesque at Moody’s, including for debt repayment. Moody’s projects $18bn and $20bn of cash flow from operations in 2020 and 2021, respectively, substantially all of which can be repatriated and used for debt reduction and shareholder dividends.  “Allergan, with its well-­known Botox, is being used to smooth the wrinkles this time not of a face but of a company,” said analysts at Wells Fargo. They cautioned they weren’t convinced the deal would be a better long-term alternative for investors looking past the loss of exclusivity for Humira. Mr Gonzalez’s challenge at AbbVie is proving wrong both the analysts and the investors who wiped nearly $20bn off his company’s market capitalisation on Tuesday. ","26.06.2019"
"UBS investment bank suffers 64% fall in profits","Weak results add to pressure on chief executive Sergio Ermotti","UBS reported a 64 per cent plunge in first-quarter profit at its investment bank, adding pressure on long-serving chief executive Sergio Ermotti, who has seen the sheen wiped off his turnround of the Swiss lender. Executives blamed a lack of market volatility for a 22 per cent decline in equities revenue compared with the same period a year earlier — in line with Wall Street rivals — and a “lack of private transactions” for a 48 per cent fall in the advisory and capital markets division.  These were slightly offset by a rise in fixed income and currency trading, but overall the investment bank’s pre-tax profit fell to $221m from $619m in the first three months of the year.  “It is not an idiosyncratic UBS situation . . . but if we see a persistent time of this kind of environment, we would have to think about how we need to adapt our business model,” Mr Ermotti told the Financial Times, adding that he would not be forced into a big strategic decision based on a “couple of bad quarters”. UBS’s flagship wealth management unit provided little respite: earnings declined 21 per cent to $873m, even though it attracted $22bn of net new money from its wealthiest pool of clients in the period, including a record $16bn in Asia. The bad start to the year — while well-flagged by executives last month — is another issue for Mr Ermotti after a brutal end to 2018, when wealth and asset management clients withdrew $13bn amid global market turmoil and the investment bank swung to a $47m loss. UBS has since been slapped with a €4.5bn penalty in France for helping rich clients evade taxes. UBS’s performance is thrown into sharper relief when compared with its Zurich-based arch rival. On Wednesday Credit Suisse posted better than expected trading revenues and profit at its wealth management unit jumped 8 per cent. “The results are better than their recent profit warning,” said Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan. However, UBS’s current “cost-reduction programme . . . is not enough and management need to address more measures within the group given ongoing revenue environment uncertainty”. So far 2019 has been “characterised by challenging market conditions, which improved towards the end and into April,” said Mr Ermotti, who pioneered a widely praised repositioning of UBS from investment banking to wealth management since taking over in 2011. He promised revenues would improve in the second half as assets under management for ultra-wealthy clients recovered and cost cuts came through. The bank also said it would resume its $1bn share-buyback programme in the second quarter, which some analysts had fretted would be cancelled or postponed. Overall first-quarter net profits plunged 27 per cent to $1.1bn in the first three months of the year, beating analysts’ average estimate of $902m. Revenue fell 12 per cent to $7.2bn, around $200m less than analysts expected. Separately, after the Financial Times reported on Tuesday that UBS and Deutsche Bank were in “serious” talks to merge their asset management units, Mr Ermotti said: “On the M&A side, we always say that we take a very pragmatic view of the word, we think about what is best for shareholders and clients . . . but we are not in a position to say things are sacrosanct and we have to . . . retain flexibility.”  Shares in UBS rose 1 per cent on Thursday to Sfr13.52, but have fallen 18 per cent in the past 12 months.","25.04.2019"
"Activist Edward Bramson zeroes in on LBO loans in Barclays battle","Bank rejects investor’s criticism it is over-reliant on such lending","In his campaign for Barclays to shrink its investment bank, activist investor Edward Bramson is zoning in on a new target: leveraged loans.  Mr Bramson, who will try to force his way on to Barclays’ board on Thursday, has told other top shareholders that the British bank is too reliant on revenues from lending to fund leveraged buyouts of companies by private equity houses and other acquirers.  Barclays has worked on some of the biggest leveraged buyouts in recent years, and was one of the banks that recently raised $10bn of junk bonds to fund the $13.2bn acquisition of Johnson Controls’ auto battery business by investment group Brookfield. However, Mr Bramson has argued that leveraged loans revenue will dry up in an economic downturn and that Barclays is exposed to future bad debts because it keeps some of the risk on its own balance sheet.  In an interview with the Financial Times, Barclays chief executive Jes Staley was unapologetic about the bank’s strength in leveraged loans, describing large private equity groups such as Blackstone, Apollo and Carlyle as “extraordinary economic engines”.  He said: “To play an important role in the investment banking space without having strong relationships with the private equity world just doesn’t make sense.” Whereas Barclays ranks sixth or seventh in areas of investment banking such as securities trading or providing mergers and acquisitions advice, it punches well above its weight when it comes to financing leveraged buyouts. According to data from Dealogic, Barclays was the fourth largest originator of leveraged finance in the US last year with $689m of net revenues, behind Bank of America, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase. In Europe, it has gone from eighth in the 2016 league table to second place last year.  In some ways, leveraged finance is a sweet spot for investment banks such as Barclays in that it provides a stream of fees that is less exposed to forces beyond their control such as interest rates or market volatility. Lenders can package the loans up and sell them on to other investors to lessen their exposure to future defaults. However, the $1.4tn leveraged loan market has come under intense scrutiny from global regulators, who are worried about a loosening of credit standards that could cause a shock to the global financial system if many companies cannot pay their debts. In March, The Financial Stability Board, a global rulemaker, launched an examination of parts of the market, in the latest instance of officials intensifying their scrutiny of the potential risks surrounding corporate debt.  And last month, the co-managing partner at Bain Capital, one of the largest buyout groups, told the FT that private equity firms were taking on too much debt in the competition to win deals.  We hold on to very little of the residual risk: we underwrite it and then we place it [with investors]Jes Staley, Barclays chief executive Mr Staley said private equity groups were a “very important source of client base” for investment banks such as Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which do not have the same strength in corporate banking enjoyed by JPMorgan, Citigroup and HSBC.  For instance, Mr Staley recounted how Barclays became the lead bank for ADT, the US security systems company, thanks to its role in arranging finance for Apollo’s $7bn leveraged buyout of the group in 2016.  He said: “It’s a process that repeats itself quite often. As private equity companies discover companies and create new companies, the clients that fall out of that become a significant source of your client franchise.”  Mr Staley said that as chief executive he had been able to capitalise on his existing relationships with private equity groups that were forged during a decades-long career in investment banking.  However, in recent meetings with investors, Mr Bramson has repeatedly raised the issue of Barclays’ reliance on leveraged loans. The activist investor argues — often without much hard evidence — that the bank must be offering more favourable credit terms than its Wall Street rivals to win business, according to several people briefed on the discussions.  Mr Bramson, who is Barclays’ second-largest investor with a 5.5 per cent stake, has predicted the fees the bank earns from providing the loans would dry up in an economic crisis, the people said.  They added that the activist believes the bank is exposed to future bad debts because it keeps a small portion of the loans, in the form of a revolving credit facility, on its own balance sheet.  “While they don’t break it out, we’ve seen they’ve held share very well in high-yield leveraged finance at the riskier end of the spectrum,” said one top-10 investor with whom Mr Bramson recently met. “Clearly that’s a business that faces cyclical revenue headwinds.”  Mr Staley denied that the bank had loosened its standards recently, and said that it had not increased risk limits last set in 2014.  He added: “We hold on to very little of the residual risk: we underwrite it and then we place it [with investors], but the actual residual hold is very small.” Barclays’ crunch vote Shareholders will descend on the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in Westminster on Thursday for Barclays’ annual meeting, where they must decide whether to back an attempt by investor Edward Bramson to force his way on to the board.  The bank’s executives are quietly confident Mr Bramson does not have enough support to be elected as a director, a view shared by many of the top investors who have spoken to the FT in recent weeks.  Given that Mr Bramson has little chance of taking a board seat, attention has turned to the proportion of shareholders who will register their vote in support of the activist, who is calling on Barclays to scale back its investment bank.  Mr Bramson is expected to vote all of his 5.5 per cent stake in favour of his election. According to one top 10 investor, if Barclays can hold his support below a further 5 or 6 per cent of investors, it will have been a very good day for the bank.  Conversely, if Mr Bramson were to win upwards of 25 per cent of the votes, he could claim a “victory of sorts”, the investor said.  Although the level of overall support matters, another important factor is whether the institutions that are shareholders of both Barclays and Sherborne Investors — the vehicle through which Mr Bramson owns his stake — come through for the activist.  If Mr Bramson did struggle to win significant support among his own backers, it could be embarrassing for the activist and complicate his intention to step up his battle with Barclays after tomorrow’s meeting.

"Will the European elections boost the euro?","Market questions is the FT’s guide to the week ahead","Analysts say the threat of more upheavals in Italian politics will probably keep the euro on the back foot © Reuters Will the European elections boost the euro?
 The machinations of Italian politics are set to be a key driver for the euro after May 26, when the results of the European Parliament elections are known. Italian bond yields climbed higher in the middle of last week, pushing the gap between the yields on German Bunds and Italian debt to its widest level this year. The nervousness came after Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister, said that Rome should allow its fiscal deficit to rise above the EU’s upper limit. It is a stance that seems bound to end in clashes between Italy and the European Commission, when the two sides start negotiations over the country’s new budget following the elections. Citi economists said the European elections would probably determine the balance of power within Italy’s coalition government. As such, a result that favours rightwing representatives could lead to a more confrontational approach towards the EU. A strong showing from rightwing candidates could also force a new general election. “The outcome of the European Parliament elections will probably influence the course of Italian politics, with a strong showing by [the League] seen emboldening Salvini to precipitate a crisis in the government, which is not particularly difficult,” said Marc Chandler, a strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. Analysts say the threat of more upheavals in Italian politics, coupled with anxiety over Brexit and Chinese growth, will probably keep the euro on the back foot. Deutsche Bank, for example, has cut its forecast for the single currency, expecting it to trade at $1.13 by the end of 2019, rather than an earlier call of $1.25. The euro is currently trading around $1.12. Eva Szalay
 European elections 2019: viewpoints from a continent at a crossroadsSubtitles unavailable Will US corporate earnings continue to grow?  Ahead of the latest round of first-quarter US corporate earnings, the consensus among analysts was that profits would shrink. However, with about 90 per cent of listed companies having reported, the results instead reveal modest growth in net income of 0.2 per cent, according to Credit Suisse data. The increase seems small but it is significant: it means US companies have managed to boost earnings without the aid of last year’s corporate tax cuts, which boosted the profitability of US groups by about 23 per cent, according to Schroders research. The results also eased concerns of a looming “earnings recession” in which the growth in companies’ profits dips into negative territory for two consecutive quarters. But despite the positive headlines, Alex Tedder fears growth in US earnings has peaked. “What worries me now is where we are in terms of profitability,” said the head of global equities for Schroders. “This is as good as it gets for US corporate profit growth — it can only get worse from here.” Richard Henderson


  Could Trump visit lift Tokyo stocks? Japanese stocks have fallen steeply over the first nine sessions of the new Imperial era, which is hardly the auspicious start many had hoped for. But it also represents a market in need of direction, and a clear answer to the question of whether the collateral damage from a US-China trade war might be offset by progress on a US-Japan trade deal. European Parliament elections explainedSubtitles unavailable  Japan’s full-year earnings season, which essentially wrapped up on Friday, offered little clarity: only nine of the 33 sectors in the Topix index saw their operating profits for the 2018 financial year beat analysts’ consensus estimates. Across the board, there was a mismatch between sales beating estimates — but profits missing them. With results out of the way, the market may start to get a sense of whether gut- churning geopolitics might have distinct advantages for Japanese companies. As UBS economist James Malcolm argues, prime minister Shinzo Abe has not only cultivated a relationship with Donald Trump, but Japan’s recently signed economic partnership agreement with the EU has left the US likely to settle for similar levels of access. Any relocation of production away from China arising from US-China friction could generate capex demand for Japanese companies. Mr Trump will come to Japan later this month and the equity market now has a clear run to consider the implications. Leo Lewis

"Saudi Aramco deepens Indian ties with Reliance partnership","Deal brokered by Mohammed bin Salman and Mukesh Ambani comes at crucial time","When Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited India in February, he was greeted at the airport with a bear hug by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  But Mr Modi, in some ways, was a third cog to another relationship — the one between Prince Mohammed and Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, that has culminated in Saudi Aramco’s plans to take a 20 per cent stake in the Indian company’s oil refining unit, which values the business at $75bn including debt. Prince Mohammed is renowned for making people wait for hours. But in a sign of how important their first meeting during the two-day trip to Delhi was, it was the Saudi royal who had to bide his time after Mr Ambani’s flight from Mumbai was delayed. “When the crown prince visited India, that’s when the deal was struck,” said one person briefed on the meeting who said Mr Ambani, Asia’s richest man, sought a direct relationship with the kingdom’s highest authorities. “The pair had chemistry and the establishment in India gave their blessing.” The tie-up would link the world’s largest oil exporter with the fastest-growing energy consumer at a crucial time. Saudi Arabia has turned to India after a series of crises engulfed the kingdom in a wave of international censure following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, just as it seeks to showcase its credentials as a global investment heavyweight and destination for foreign cash flows — including the flotation of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producing company.   In return India, which is preoccupied with its own energy security, has secured a long term oil deal when global supplies have been shaken by disruptions in Iran and Venezuela. It would also be one of the biggest foreign investments in the country’s history. However, the partnership has had an inauspicious start. Following further discussions involving senior Saudi officials and top Saudi Aramco executives, the deal almost fell apart on multiple occasions after Reliance sought a greater valuation, according to two people close to the talks. Then Mr Ambani, who heads of one of India’s biggest conglomerates, announced the yet to be finalised deal at a shareholder meeting on Monday, overshadowing Saudi Aramco’s first ever earnings call. An executive at the Saudi state giant then declared the partnership was still at a “very early stage”. Both sides have much at stake. At a time when oil demand is weakening in the west, Saudi Aramco is keen to expand across Asia and develop refinery partnerships, as consumption growth in emerging economies is bolstered by swelling middle classes. For years, it has been a supplier of crude to Reliance’s refinery and petrochemicals complex in Gujarat, the largest in India. But the new supply agreement of 500,000 barrels a day would represent about 40 per cent of Reliance’s crude demand, which is double what Saudi Aramco has traditionally supplied to the Indian company. “Saudi Aramco continues to show keen interest in accessing the Indian market, which has the strongest long-term growth prospects,” said Alan Gelder, a refining and chemicals expert at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. For Reliance, the deal is a crucial part of its aim to cut net debt to zero by March 2021. Its debt pile has swelled as it rolled out its ambitious digital services arm Jio, with 340m mobile subscribers. It has also built the largest retail company in India as it makes a bold shift into consumer-facing businesses. But its financials have come under increasing scrutiny. Credit Suisse last week downgraded Reliance shares and cut its target price for the stock, reflecting concerns about its $22bn debt pile.  Reliance said foreign partnerships were a key part of cutting this debt. In addition to the prospective deal with Saudi Aramco, BP last week agreed to form a network of petrol stations and an aviation fuels business with Reliance. PMS Prasad, executive director of Reliance, is keen to use other business lines to attract these foreign partners. For instance, loyalty programmes could entice Jio users to refuel at their petrol stations.   As these new partners expand in India, Mr Prasad hopes they will use Jio’s high-speed internet network, and use Reliance’s existing land to build new projects quickly. “We have a very, very strong domestic presence. They can leverage this,” said Mr Prasad. “They’re getting everything risk free.” Using the Saudi Aramco deal to reduce debt was only a part of a broader motive for Reliance, said Mr Prasad. “This is a strategic deal, rather than a debt reduction deal.”  The BP and Saudi Aramco partnerships also hint at a deeper overhaul of Reliance’s family-led structure. It intends to create a standalone petrochemical and refining entity within five years, executives said, while listing its digital and retail businesses. Should the deal close as planned, Saudi Aramco will appoint senior managers and gain board seats in the tie-up, as well as one on Reliance’s board. Analysts point to a shift as India’s venerable family-run conglomerates infuse more external, professional management into their leadership. Reliance was started by Mr Ambani’s father Dhirubhai in the mid-20th century, whose two sons then took over separate chunks of the business in 2005.   Mr Prasad said Reliance would benefit from this external expertise, while retaining its core Ambani leadership.  “The culture has changed within the company,” he said. Referring to Saudi Aramco, he added: “Maybe we have something to learn from them.” Jayanth Kolla, founder of Bangalore-based consultancy Convergence Catalyst, said such a deal would not only allow foreign oil and gas majors to tap into Reliance’s digital expertise but could also harness the technological prowess of a company such as Saudi Aramco.  “Any organisation or a conglomerate the size of Reliance has no choice”, he said, if they want to stay competitive. “It’s a big opportunity, a big deal.” Ambani’s ambitions catch the eye In what was a raucous and theatrical shareholder meeting, the most eccentric moment might have been when Mukesh Ambani’s children stood on stage and — donning virtual reality goggles — proceeded to shop for clothes online, play Fifa and watch a clip from the Lion King. It was an eye-catching way to introduce the next step of what is thought to be Mr Ambani’s most ambitious project of all: building a digital giant capable of taking on foreign tech companies such as Amazon or Netflix. Since launching its digital arm Jio in 2016, Reliance has attracted 340m mobile subscribers through cut-price contracts and effectively handing out smartphones for free. Mr Ambani said at the AGM on Monday that Jio would roll out its long-awaited home broadband services from September, along with a cloud computing partnership with Microsoft. An ecommerce venture, announced earlier this year, was also poised to launch soon, Mr Ambani said. In tested fashion, Jio is planning to eat up market share from existing competitors by offering deals it bets consumers will struggle to turn down. The auditorium burst into thunderous applause as Mr Ambani announced that the first subscribers to his broadband would receive free television sets, while start-ups will be able to use the Microsoft-powered cloud for free. “We are at the end of the very beginning of the Jio story,” said Mr Ambani. “India will lead and not follow the advanced nations of the world in adopting, even creating disruptive technologies.”","13.08.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Cairn, Ryanair, G4S, Sirius Minerals, EnQuest, Zalando","Standard Life Aberdeen’s insurance sale has put dividends at risk, says RBC","Tuesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● British Airways owner IAG slipped after the UK Civil Aviation Authority joined worldwide regulators in grounding Boeing’s B737 Max in the wake of Sunday’s Ethiopian Airlines crash. But low-cost carriers including Ryanair and easyJet edged higher on expectations that production delays would cap European short-haul capacity growth. Just 371 Max jets are in service globally, representing just over 1.4 per cent of the total B737 fleet. However, the Max makes up nearly all of Boeing’s order book with around 4,600 aircraft waiting to be delivered, equivalent to six years of production, said Credit Suisse. Ryanair was due to take delivery of 33 Max jets this year while Norwegian Air Shuttle and Turkish Airlines had ordered 16 and 12 respectively, so any delays have the potential to “meaningfully lower” capacity growth and boost sector pricing power, the broker said. ● Cairn Energy slipped to a two-month low after the oil explorer cut its reserve estimate for the Kraken field in the North Sea by 19 per cent based on reservoir performance. Full-year results from Cairn were otherwise uneventful. EnQuest, operator of the Kraken field, responded by saying its view of the reserves remained “materially unchanged” ahead of its own full-year results due on March 21. It cited different technical approaches to production forecasting and reserves scoping. “We expect the market to follow Cairn’s more prudent view given the field’s production history and plans for a further shutdown in 2019.”Barclays ● G4S retreated after mixed full-year results from the security group overshadowed confirmation that it was planning to spin off its cash-handling business. Earnings per share of 16.7p was 0.2p light versus consensus forecasts and net debt was about 5 per cent higher at £1.56bn due to poor cash conversion, which G4S blamed on contract phasing and the US federal government shutdown. ● Sirius Minerals rallied to recoup most of a sharp loss in the previous session. The developer of a Yorkshire fertiliser mine said it had received a “conditional proposal” from a “major global financial institution” in respect to its targeted stage-two project financing. Sirius gave no detail beyond saying that the potential new funding line would completely replace the proposed $3bn facility it outlined in late January, which involved uncovered bonds, commercial bank debt and a state-backed loan.  “At a high level, we were sceptical of Sirius’s ability to complete the prior multi-tranche facility within both an acceptable timeframe and cost,” said JPMorgan Cazenove, which had previously argued that any high-yield bond issue would need to have an equity component. “Without seeing the detail, the proposed alternative structure seemingly mitigates these risks and at the same time simplifies the structure, which on balance is positive.” Nevertheless, JPMorgan saw a possibility that any private backer of Sirius would still want new equity, such as via a convertible bond. Sirius has a deadline of the end of April to finalise funding.  “We think this gives some clarity around the delays in debt financing and from a top-down view looks a simpler solution with only one party to deal with. Shares should react well to the news.”Liberum Sellside stories ● RBC downgraded asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen to “underperform” from “sector perform” with a 215p target price.  “Recent mortality data has indicated that SLA ceded even more value when it sold its insurer. A derating has not yet occurred, net outflows continue and we believe the dividend is less secure . . . The cash generation of the business is now leveraged to prevailing market conditions.”RBC Recently published 2018 mortality tables showed a six-month reduction in life expectancy, which underlined that SLA sold Standard Life Assurance too cheaply to Phoenix in August, said RBC. The large reduction in mortality came in early 2018, many months before the deal completed, yet the profits from the annuity book had fallen to Phoenix, it said. Moreover, deteriorating life expectancy meant Phoenix had seven years of reserve releases to benefit from, the broker argued. Meanwhile, SLA’s flagship Gars fund had continued to show net outflows in spite of an improved performance, said RBC. It forecast the fund would lose £7bn of net flows this year, having ceded £15bn in 2018, which led the broker to cut earnings forecasts by as much as 31 per cent. Yet outperformance versus other asset managers had meant SLA continued to trade at 13 times consensus 2018 earnings, the same valuation it had at the end of 2017, RBC said. ● Citigroup downgraded Zalando, the German online fashion retailer, to “neutral” from “overweight” with an unchanged €36 price target. The downgrade follows Zalando’s capital markets day, where management set out a plan to win market share by growing sales both directly and through its commission-based marketplace business. “We think Zalando is sacrificing significant margin to drive long-term growth, which should drive higher shareholder value in the long term,” said Citi. It was positive on the plan on a five-year view but added: “The changing business mix of Zalando is likely to cause volatility for both sales and operating profit. It may also disguise underlying trends and make them difficult to interpret.” ● In brief: Antofagasta cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Clarkson raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Credit Suisse cut to “underperform” at KBW; Do & Co upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; EON cut to “neutral” at UBS; Lloyds upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; P2P Global Investments raised to “buy” at Canaccord; Saint-Gobain upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays; Stock Spirits rated new “buy” at Panmure Gordon; Telefónica downgraded to “hold” at Berenberg.

"Inside Samsung’s $116bn plan to overtake chip rivals","Battle lines drawn with TSMC as S Korean group sets sight on $70bn processor market","When Samsung told engineers in its flagship memory chip team that they were being moved to a division making processor chips, they often asked what they had done wrong, according to industry insiders. Processors are the “brain” of any computer, making decisions and storing and retrieving data, and Samsung fabricates its own processors for all its devices, from smartphones to tablets to laptops. But inside Samsung’s huge chip division, which had sales of Won86tn ($73.3bn) last year, the processor unit has played second fiddle to the team making memory chips, the circuits that store data, which accounted for 84 per cent of those sales. For three years, demand for memory chips has been sky-high, partly fed by the boom in smartphones, and partly by the need to build more and more data centres to house the vast amount of data being produced by individuals and businesses. But in the first quarter of this year, Samsung saw its operating profit slump 60 per cent, as a global surfeit of memory chips drove prices down. Now the South Korean company wants to boost its processor unit and has said it will invest Won133tn over the next decade to be the world’s biggest and most advanced producer of processor chips by 2030, according to one executive at the company’s Giheung campus, south of Seoul. Whoever dominates the industry will be critical in underpinning new technologies such as artificial intelligence, 5G and autonomous vehicles. They will also enjoy the spoils of the foundry market — making chips under contract for other companies — which is forecast by TrendForce to near $70bn in annual production this year, and by IC Insights to see revenue growth soon outpace that of other chip segments. Samsung’s success or failure will also have ramifications across the tech sector: affecting China’s dreams of semiconductor self-sufficiency, potentially loosening Taiwan’s long-held supremacy on making processor chips and expanding South Korea’s position in the electronics supply chain. But the jury is out among sector analysts over what will happen next.  Samsung lags behind TSMC Samsung only has 8 per cent of the foundry market for processor chips and will need to raise its share significantly to dethrone Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which has for years controlled more than half the market. Along the way, Samsung may also need to fend off Chinese challengers backed by Beijing. While Samsung and TSMC are neck and neck when it comes to the size and power of their chips, TSMC has dominated the market since its founder Morris Chang hatched the independent foundry model in the late 1980s. The Hsinchu-based group is a darling among tech analysts, boasting strong relationships with chip designers as well as many of the world’s biggest device makers, including Apple and Huawei. For Samsung, questions swirl around two key areas: money and trust. To consistently break new ground making the world’s leading edge chips, TSMC is pouring about 8 per cent of its annual revenues back into research and development — $2.9bn in 2018. Samsung’s announcement in April signalled its readiness to at least stay in the race of producing leading-edge chips. Out of the $115.7bn, roughly $63.5bn will be allocated for R&D and the remainder for manufacturing facilities. Nevertheless, analysts pointed out that Samsung’s annual capex spend for its chip-making unit over the next decade shakes out to about $5bn-$6bn, against TSMC’s stated range of $10bn-$12bn over the next few years. “It would still say Samsung is going to be spending at a level to be the ‘number two’ foundry business,” said Randy Abrams, a Taipei-based analyst for Credit Suisse. Conflict of interest As Samsung sees it, the cash promised to 2030 ensures sustainable growth, and executives have not ruled out a further ramp-up in spending. TSMC won dominance by sharply jacking up spending on chip technology and production capacity just ahead of the smartphone boom, after winning Apple as core customer. Samsung is now searching for a similar opportunity, hoping that new applications around 5G, AI or the internet of things may give it an opening. “If the timing was right, we could do something similar [to TSMC],” the executive said. But Samsung is also a significant player in smartphones and devices, meaning some potential customers are wary that it has a conflict of interest. Many of the companies Samsung wants to make chips for are direct competitors — and the concerns have lingered even after the company carved out its chipmaking unit from the rest of the division in 2017. “Apple and Huawei both command a sizeable share of silicon, and growing over time, it is two big parts of the market that Samsung just doesn’t have much have access to,” Mr Abrams said. Will companies trust Samsung?  Samsung Electronics is one of the companies most exposed to Japan’s threat to restrict supplies used in chip-making © Bloomberg Samsung executives, underscoring attempts to address the trust issue, point to further efforts in the past two years, including new legal compliance protections and firewalls to protect clients’ intellectual property. Industry watchers question whether Samsung has allayed concerns. “Trust takes years to build. It is more than a piece of paper,” said Mark Li, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong. And for some of Samsung’s chief rivals, TSMC’s position as a purely independent chipmaker has appeal, analysts said. Elizabeth Sun, TSMC’s director of corporate communications, said the company is “very well aware of the competition coming from Samsung”. But the Taiwan group is bullish, saying the Korean company would never be a foundry chipmaker such as TSMC.  “We would never compete with our customers,” Ms Sun said. “What we do [is] we collaborate with customers . . . Samsung competes with everyone. That doesn’t mean they will never get any foundry customers . . . But will they rely on Samsung the way they rely on TSMC?” Samsung has reinvented itself many times Further complicating the near-term outlook, Japan’s new export controls on materials used in semiconductor production could disrupt Samsung’s use of extreme ultraviolet machines, critical for making its most advanced chips. But some analysts pointed to Samsung’s history of several cycles of successful reinvention. In 1983 the South Korean company sampled its first dynamic random access memory chip; 10 years later it blew past Japan’s Toshiba as the world’s biggest memory chip producer, industry watcher Don Dingee writes in his history of the chip sector.  Then in 1994 the company shipped its first NAND flash parts, and by late 2002 it supplied more than half that market. Mobile phones took longer: from “reverse engineering a Toshiba car phone” in the early 1980s to shipping more smartphones than Apple in 2011. “If you ask me whether Samsung can overtake TSMC in five years? My answer is simply ‘no’,” said Daniel Kim, a chip sector analyst at Macquarie in Seoul. “But over 20 to 30 years Samsung has transformed itself several times, very successfully. Microsoft did it once, Nokia did it once. But what other [technology] companies have done it three or four times?”","22.07.2019"
"DE Shaw to revert to ‘3 and 30’ model as cost pressures bite","‘Barbelling’ sees clients move to either cheap, simple funds or pricey, high-octane ones","
DE Shaw is ratcheting up the cost of its flagship $14bn hedge fund despite falling fees across the asset management industry, highlighting the still-ravenous demand enjoyed by top quantitative investment groups. The hedge fund industry has come under pressure to cut fees, after a long spell of underperforming mainstream markets, rising cost-consciousness among investors and stronger demand for other “alternative” investments, such as private equity.  Hedge funds historically charged a 2 per cent annual management fee and 20 per cent of any profits. However, only 3 per cent now charge a 2 per cent management fee, and 16 per cent take a fifth of profits, according to Credit Suisse. The average is now just 1.45 per cent and 16.9 per cent respectively. DE Shaw, founded by the reclusive billionaire computer scientist David Shaw, was also forced to cut the fees on its Composite Fund in 2011, from a 3 per cent management fee and a 30 per cent performance fee to a still-high 2.5 per cent and 25 per cent.  However, the fund has been closed to new investors since 2013, and strong performance — it returned 11.2 per cent last year, in spite of the market turmoil — means that the hedge fund feels confident enough to lift its fees back to its previous “3 and 30” level, according to a person familiar with the matter.  “There are powerful trends that are reshaping the industry underneath the surface,” Barclays said in a report on hedge funds earlier this spring. “Strategy-wise, there has been a massive rotation over the past few years away from discretionary strategies and into quantitative ones.”  The industry’s top players are benefiting disproportionately from this, in what analysts have termed a “barbelling” of the asset management ecosystem, where cheap and simple strategies and expensive, high-octane ones enjoy most of the investor demand. This bifurcation was underscored in the divergent performance of many hedge funds amid last year’s market mayhem. While the average hedge fund lost 4.8 per cent in 2018, according to HFR, a researcher, DE Shaw and other big, largely computer-powered “systematic” players managed to profit from the turbulence. Bridgewater’s Pure Alpha returned 14.6 per cent, Renaissance Technologies’ Institutional Equities fund gained 8.5 per cent, and Two Sigma’s Absolute Return and Compass funds rose 11 per cent and 14 per cent respectively.  Despite hedge funds broadly enjoying their best start to a year since 2006, investors yanked another $17.8bn out in the first quarter. In contrast, several of the biggest quant hedge fund vehicles remain closed to new investors, given that their strategies could splutter if too much money was put to work.  However, DE Shaw’s decision to lift the fees on its Composite Fund — effective from the start of 2020 — also reflects how even the industry’s biggest players are feeling the pressure of mounting costs and ferocious competition for talent. This is especially true for data scientists and programmers that have become increasingly important in the money management industry, and form the backbone of people at quantitative investment groups such as DE Shaw. Headhunters estimate that a “quant” with merely five years of experience could expect pay packages of at least $300,000 a year, up from about $250,000 a few years ago, while more senior analysts and portfolio managers can expect at least $500,000 and probably well over $1m.","19.04.2019"
"World Bank arm launches ‘impact investment’ standards ","Nine principles will bring greater transparency, comparability and rigour to $500bn market","A coalition of 60 asset managers and institutional investors has signed up to new standards designed to accelerate the growth of so-called “impact” investments that aim to deliver positive benefits to society.  An absence of globally accepted definitions has hindered efforts to encourage greater investor interest in impact investing projects that marry social or environmental goals with attractive financial returns.  The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, has created a new framework of nine principles designed to bring greater transparency, comparability and rigour to the impact investing market.  The initiative, which was announced in Washington on Friday, has drawn support from UBS, Amundi, Axa Investment Managers, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse as well as insurers including Prudential Financial and Zurich. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Development Bank of Latin America have also signed up.  Philippe Le Houérou, IFC chief executive, said the impact investment market could reach $26tn if it could be brought into the mainstream. About $502bn in assets is currently dedicated to impact investing, according to the Global Impact Investing Network, an industry body, “We want much more money managed for impact because there is no time to lose to protect our planet and communities around the world,” said Mr Le Houérou.  The IFC’s framework requires asset managers to document the expected and actual impact of investment projects. It also suggests that asset managers should consider the achievement of impact investment targets along with financial performance metrics when awarding incentive payments to staff.  The previous lack of uniform standards has led to concerns that unsuitable projects are being promoted as impact investments, an abuse known as “impact washing”.  The IFC said regular independent verification reports should be published to ensure the actions of impact investment managers remained consistent with the new standards.   “Most investors will want to see independent verification from a specialist practitioner. The IFC’s initiative is an important step towards broadening and deepening the impact investment market,” said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management.  The framework devised by the IFC allows managers to employ a variety of approaches, metrics and tools to assess impact investment projects.  Actis, a $15bn London-based private equity manager that specialises in emerging markets, has constructed a new scoring system that demonstrates how the IFC’s framework can be applied in practice. It will measure the contribution of Actis and investee companies in driving improvements across a range of five key metrics to determine a single “impact multiple” that allows comparisons between projects in different sectors and geographies. “Unverified, opaque and incompatible approaches to measurement must be replaced if impact investing is to achieve its potential,” said Shami Nissan, head of responsible investing at Actis.  Actis invested $113m in Integrated Diagnostics, an Egyptian medical group, in 2014. It has since opened 96 new laboratories across Africa, increased the number of patients served by 14 per cent to 6.4m a year and raised the number of tests performed by 3.4m annually to 25.7m.","12.04.2019"

"UBS shareholders revolt after record French tax-evasion fine","Vote to discharge board and top executives from liability falls short of majority needed","UBS’s shareholders have voted against the Swiss bank’s top managers after they made an ill-advised bet to fight rather than settle a French probe into money laundering, which resulted in a record €4.5bn penalty. At the lender’s annual meeting in Basel on Thursday, 42 per cent of investors voted against and 17 per cent abstained from discharging the board and top executives from legal liability in protest at their handling of the French tax case, meaning it fell short of the majority needed to pass. The vote was expected to be close after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services said investors should vote against UBS after a French court found the bank guilty of illegally soliciting ultra-rich clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion in February.  A judge levied a record €3.7bn fine and ordered UBS to pay €800m in damages. The bank is appealing, but that process could take years. The decision is “a reflection of your concern about uncertainty surrounding the court case in France and you want to keep all possible legal options open. I can understand that,” chairman Axel Weber said after the defeat. “It wasn’t possible to reach an acceptable out-of-court settlement,” which meant we had “no choice but to go to court. “We believe this was in the best interests of shareholders” and “will not waver from the chosen path”, he added. We will take this as an opportunity to review carefully our compensation model and adjust it if necessaryAxel Weber, UBS chairman UBS also suffered a protest vote on executive pay. Twenty per cent of shareholders voted against the compensation report of UBS — slightly more than Zurich rival Credit Suisse last week — after another proxy adviser Glass Lewis urged them not to approve it because a small decrease in the 2018 bonus pool did not reflect the sharp fall in the share price last year and the multibillion-euro French penalty. The result is “lower than in recent years, disappointment with the stock performance clearly left its mark on the outcome of this vote, as well as the case in France”, Mr Weber said. “We will take this as an opportunity to review carefully our compensation model and adjust it if necessary.” It has been a tough few weeks for UBS. Last week, it reported a 64 per cent plunge in first-quarter profit at its investment bank and a 21 per cent decline in earnings at its flagship wealth management unit. The poor results piled pressure on long-serving chief executive Sergio Ermotti, who has seen the sheen wiped off his previously lauded turnround of the Swiss lender. Separately, Mr Weber said the bank had found no evidence of “systematic discrimination” against women returning from maternity leave, despite more than a dozen new mothers telling the Financial Times they had suffered long-term cuts to their bonuses when restarting work. Mr Weber said a “very meticulous” review of its maternity policies “has shown that our controls are effective”, dismissing the FT report as “rumours” in response to questions about the issue from shareholders at the annual meeting. “Employees have been encouraged to contact HR if they feel treated unfairly on pay . . . I promise you each and every case is reviewed by experts, if there are exceptions they will be remedied,” the chairman said. 
 In March, top female wealth management staff in Switzerland criticised the lender over its practice of using their maternity leave as a reason for imposing long-term cuts to their bonuses. Some said they had resigned in frustration, while others having begrudgingly continued working for less pay than before they became mothers. UBS has been one of the more vocal banks about gender equality. However, there is only one woman on UBS’s 13-strong group executive board, while the supervisory board has four female directors compared with eight male ones.","02.05.2019"
"Walgreens Boots slashes outlook after ‘most difficult quarter’","Drugstore and chemist group warns on tough industry conditions and continued UK weakness","Walgreens Boots Alliance has slashed its full-year earnings outlook after warning that weak retail sales in both the US and UK had led to the transatlantic pharmacy chain’s “most difficult quarter” since its merger five years ago. Shares in the company, which operates Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the US and Boots in the UK, fell more than 13 per cent in early trading after it forecast that 2019 profits would be flat rather than increasing 7 to 12 per cent. Like other US drugstore chains, Walgreens’ margins are being hit by pressure to cut prescription drug prices as well as cheaper generic drugs. While prescription sales in its US stores rose 9.8 per cent in the second quarter, gross profit fell 3.2 per cent.  Stefano Pessina, chief executive, blamed “consumer market challenges in the US and UK” on the profit warning, admitting the company’s “response was not rapid enough”. Walgreens has added an extra $500m to its $1bn cost-cutting programme. It is already cutting costs in the UK, including announcing in February that it would cut about 20 per cent of its headcount at its Nottingham headquarters, and reviewing its store portfolio to see which might need to be closed. Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore, said drug price inflation had slowed, especially in the drugs sold at pharmacies.  Sales of general products such as toothbrushes and make-up are also under pressure from online rivals such as Amazon. Like-for-like retail sales at its US stores fell 3.8 per cent during the quarter.  Meanwhile, Walgreens said its UK business remained “challenging”. Its international business — mainly its British Boots pharmacy chain — saw sales drop 7.1 per cent year-on-year to $3.1bn as weak revenues were further knocked by the slide in the pound.  Margins for drugs are also under pressure in the UK, where the National Health Service has been cutting how much it reimburses pharmacies, Mr Muken said. Same store pharmacy sales in the UK fell 1.5 per cent because of lower revenues from hospitals and decreased revenue-per-item.  Overall sales rose 4.5 per cent to $34.5bn in the three months to end of February, largely because of the addition of 1,651 Rite Aid stores it bought last year. Net income was 14 per cent lower at $1.1bn. Stripping out one-off charges related to the previous year’s tax gains and restructuring, adjusted earnings were $1.64 per share, below the $1.72 a share the market had expected.   Shares in Walgreens were 13 per cent lower at $55.50. Rival CVS was also knocked lower and was trading down 3.3 per cent. Analysts at Credit Suisse, who reduced their target price from $79 to $70, said they believe the shares may sink further.  ","02.04.2019"

"Bond platform Tradeweb joins IPOs rush","Flotation should provide a windfall for the banks that own stakes","Tradeweb Markets, the US fixed-income and derivatives trading venue, is set to go public this year, providing a windfall for its investment bank backers and fuelling what is expected to be a bumper year of market debuts in the US. The New York group, majority-owned by data provider Refinitiv, is planning to list on Nasdaq, according to a filing with US regulators on Thursday. It is aiming for a market capitalisation of more than $5bn, according to a person familiar with the offering. The move comes just five months after Refinitiv was split out of Thomson Reuters in a $17bn deal, and will provide an opportunity for some of its longtime investors to sell down their stakes. Among them are Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, UBS and RBS. This year could be one of the largest for US listings with some of Silicon Valley’s most hotly anticipated IPOs lining up their deals. Lyft, the ride-sharing service, on Friday unveiled its float, which is expected this month. Uber, the company’s rival, is planning to list later this year. Founded in 1996, Tradeweb has been one of the winners from post-crisis rules such as the US Dodd-Frank act and Mifid II in Europe, which have incentivised more trading on transparent electronic markets. It competes with Bloomberg and MarketAxess, with nearly $550bn a day of government and corporate debt, swaps and mortgages traded on its platform, which connects investment banks with their customers like asset managers, central banks and insurers. Tradeweb will raise an as-yet undisclosed amount, which it will use to purchase the stakes of the shareholders. The 11 investment banks collectively own 46 per cent of the company, and contribute 42 per cent of its revenues. It also disclosed that two senior executives — chief executive and co-founder Lee Olesky and president Billy Hult — were paid $22m and $15m respectively last year, mainly in stock and options awards. Refinitiv, which owns a 55 per cent stake, will retain a controlling interest after listing, the filing said. Last year David Craig, Refinitiv chief executive, told the Financial Times that Tradeweb was “very strategic to us.” Some shareholders have been keen to offload their stakes for several years but have been stymied by Tradeweb’s governance structure under Thomson Reuters. However, the sale of 55 per cent of Refinitiv to a consortium of Blackstone, the private equity group, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and GIC, the Singaporean wealth fund, for $17bn last year has changed the dynamics. Many have also noted the performance of MarketAxess Holdings, a rival fixed-income trading venue. Its value has risen fourfold to nearly $8.8bn in the past five years. Last month Tradeweb saw record trading volumes of US Treasuries, US investment grade credit and European exchange traded funds. Before the IPO Tradeweb expects to make a special payment of $100m to the company’s original shareholders. Tradeweb made gross revenues of $684m in the year to December 31, up from $563m a year earlier. Net income rose 55 per cent to $130m. JPMorgan is the lead banker and joint book-running managers are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.","07.03.2019"
"Fund eyes sale of stake in US child migrant centre contractor","Jefferies leads DC Capital’s search for buyers of ‘politically charged’ holding","A US private equity firm is trying to sell shares in a government contractor that has drawn criticism for its role operating a centre for migrant children separated from their families at the US border. DC Capital is looking to sell a 75 per cent stake in Caliburn International, which has grown rapidly by acquiring and combining several government contractors. The company last month shelved plans for an initial public offering, switching to a private share sale that could raise up to $583m for former Wasserstein Perella banker Thomas Campbell’s DC Capital, according to people familiar with the matter. Documents accompanying the sale warn potential investors that Caliburn operates “in a number of challenging and politically charged environments”, going on to detail the negative press attention around its “work with UACs” — unaccompanied alien children. US investment bank Jefferies is running the share sale, which it aims to wrap up before the end of April. Wall Street banks have faced increasing criticism for helping controversial businesses raise financing, as investors grow more sensitive to the ethical implications of their investments. Some lenders have publicly pulled back from contentious sectors, with JPMorgan Chase last month axing lending to private prison operators, for example. Caliburn’s subsidiary, Comprehensive Health Services, operates the Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children in Florida, a large facility that houses migrant children who arrive at the US-Mexico border without their parents. Last year, Homestead also housed some children separated from their families under US president Donald Trump’s immigration policy. Since then, the site has become the focus of protests against the policy, while the company has also faced criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Ana María Archila, co-executive director of the Center For Popular Democracy, has attacked investment banks for working with companies involved in Mr Trump’s family separation policy, telling the Financial Times that there was “no moral grey area in traumatising children”. “Companies should not be bidding on government deals to put children in cages and financial institutions should not be financing and profiting from this morally bankrupt policy,” she said. The Homestead contract is for $285m, according to the documents, and Forbes reported last month that CHS is the US’s only for-profit youth migrant shelter operator. Caliburn said it was required to accept any unaccompanied minors the US government had submitted to its custody. “The safety and welfare of unaccompanied minors at the Homestead facility is a top priority. We operate in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,” it said.  If successful, Jefferies stands to make $32m through a placement fee and share discount in Caliburn, according to documents seen by the FT. Jefferies declined to comment. Jefferies was also in the spotlight last week for a loan deal arranged for an Israeli cyber security company that has been criticised for allegedly providing spyware to target political dissidents. Herzliya-based NSO Group paid $51m in fees and expenses for its loan sale, according to an investor who has seen the presentation accompanying the deal, which was wrapped up on Tuesday.  Jefferies and fellow underwriter Credit Suisse are set to lose money, however, after most debt investors balked at NSO’s deal owing to corporate governance concerns. Caliburn generates most of its revenue in Iraq, where its subsidiary, Sallyport, helps run the US Air Force’s Balad Air Base. The company is pursuing a defamation claim against two former employees who alleged that the company disregarded wrongdoing at the facility.  The Department of Justice is investigating whether Sallyport’s former management knew about improper payments by a partner on its contracts allegedly to Iraqi government officials.

"HSBC: the bank in need of a ‘superhero’ chief executive","John Flint ousted from top job as the sprawling lender’s challenges multiplied","John Flint spent decades positioning himself as a future chief executive of HSBC. After winning the job, he lasted just 18 months. On Monday, as protests raged on the streets of Hong Kong, HSBC’s most profitable market, the bank’s employees were digesting the news that their 51-year-old boss had been ousted after losing the confidence of the board of directors.  The Asia-focused lender, one of the world’s biggest and most complex banks, offered few concrete reasons for the abrupt move beyond the official line: HSBC needed new leadership to respond to “an increasingly complex and challenging global environment”.  Several executives briefed on the circumstances surrounding Mr Flint’s unceremonious departure said the board had soured on the chief executive several months ago. “It’s simple: they felt he was not up to the job,” said one.  Having determined that Mr Flint had to go, the board decided to wait for an opportune moment. That turned out to be Monday, when the bank reported a relatively solid set of results.  HSBC’s London-listed shares closed down 3 per cent following the announcement of Mr Flint’s departure on a day of steep declines across global stock markets.  Mr Flint, who has worked for the bank for 32 years, had been unhappy for some time, according to several people who worked closely with him. He had always been mild mannered and understated, but recently he had become taciturn and withdrawn.   He complained that he was having trouble sleeping because of a brutal travel schedule that involved regularly shuttling between London, where the bank is headquartered, and Hong Kong.  “He didn’t seem to be enjoying it,” said one executive. “He was tired, worn out and fed up.”  Mr Flint had also started to spar regularly with members of his senior team, who had become frustrated at his reluctance to sign off on their decisions, and with the bank’s board, according to several executives. One colleague described him as “isolated” and unwilling to take advice from anyone apart from one or two trusted associates.  His relationship with the bank’s chairman, Mark Tucker, a gregarious former insurance executive who is mad about football, had become especially fractious, two executives said, and the pair sometimes struggled to present a united front even in public.  “John was making a lot of people unhappy, and Mark was one of them,” said one executive. Another said that Mr Flint would become rude and defensive when Mr Tucker asked probing questions about the bank’s strategy: “They rubbed each other up the wrong way”. Mr Flint did not respond to several requests for comment, although one friend said he was “proud” of his leadership given that the bank’s results beat market expectations. HSBC reported second-quarter net profits of $4.4bn, up 7 per cent compared with the same period last year, on revenues that were 10 per cent higher at $14.9bn.  The former chief executive’s style might not have mattered but for a growing sense of alarm among directors, who felt that he lacked a plan to prepare the bank for falling interest rates or the escalating trade war between the US and China.  In a strategy update in June 2018, the bank confidently predicted that interest rates would normalise and that “HSBC would get back into growth mode”.  But one executive said Mr Flint was slow to react when it became clear that interest rates would fall in most of HSBC’s markets.  The bank’s directors were also concerned about faltering efforts to revive the bank’s US business, according to one person briefed on their concerns. On Monday, the bank ditched its main profitability target for the struggling unit.  Although there was a growing sense of doubt among directors that Mr Flint had the ability to do the job, there was no one mis-step that led to his downfall, according to several people briefed on his departure. Rather, it was a failure to entertain bold moves, such as reallocating capital from low-returning businesses in the US and Europe to high-growth markets such as mainland China, or making acquisitions and disposals.  Mr Tucker had “previously stated that he expects the bank to be more dynamic, more growth focused, with clearer bias to Asia”, said one top-20 shareholder. We “sensed that the chairman felt the need for a cultural change within the leadership of the bank which invariably means CEO succession”. The doubts fuelled a more existential worry over the bank’s future among directors of HSBC, according to one person briefed on their thinking. Although the bank is among a handful of global institutions that did not need government funding during the global financial crash, it has struggled to keep pace with rivals since the crisis ended.  A telling statistic, cited by the chief executive of a rival bank, is the lender’s valuation versus its competitors over the past decade. In 2009, HSBC had a market capitalisation of $199bn — more than JPMorgan ($164bn) and Bank of America ($130bn). But now it is worth $154bn, less than half of JPMorgan and about 60 per cent of BofA. One large shareholder said they were relaxed about the decision to ditch Mr Flint, but questioned the process that led to him being appointed by Mr Tucker in the first place. “He had worked for the bank for three decades,” the investor said. “How could they not have known what he was like?”   Mr Tucker, who is said to bitterly regret his decision to appoint Mr Flint, will not want to make the same mistake twice. He has appointed Noel Quinn, the head of HSBC’s commercial bank, as an interim chief executive, and was keen to tout his credentials on Monday. But few at HSBC expect Mr Quinn to land the job on a permanent basis.  “Noel is a fantastic guy but I don’t think in his wildest dreams he expects to get the job,” said one friend of Mr Quinn. “I’m not sure he even wants to sign up for six years of CEO hell.”  Another executive added: “There’s lots of love for Noel, but the board is determined to go external this time.”  HSBC’s directors expect to take about six months to find a successor. Possible contenders include António Horta-Osório, the chief executive of Lloyds, and Tidjane Thiam, who holds the same position at Credit Suisse, according to one executive. Ewen Stevenson, the bank’s chief financial officer, who recently joined from RBS is also considered a strong “insider/outsider” candidate, the person added.  Perhaps the real question is whether anyone can satisfy the demands of one of the hardest jobs in global banking, according to Ronit Ghose, analyst at Citi, who noted that HSBC is more exposed to geopolitical tumult than its rivals.  “HSBC is straddling so many faultlines between China and the west: its future growth is tied to expansion in Greater China but it has to combine that with being a big dollar bank, with a Hong Kong profit centre and a UK headquarters,” said Mr Ghose.  He added: “You almost need a Marvel superhero to run the bank.” Additional reporting by Attracta Mooney in London

"Stocks to watch: Royal Mail, Babcock, Superdry, Moneysupermarket","Paper stocks surge after Mondi raises prices for the first time in more than a year","Wednesday 13:00 BST What’s happening ● Royal Mail bounced off a record low as details of a recovery plan eclipsed the group’s dividend cut, which had been widely anticipated. Full-year results showing a 27 per cent drop in earnings before transformation costs matched market expectations, as did 2020 guidance for operating profits of between £300m and £340m after costs.  Ahead of a capital markets day, Royal Mail set out a plan to focus on parcels and reduce its reliance on the UK, in part by scaling up its Amsterdam-based General Logistics Systems subsidiary. The plan required £500m of extra investment in parcel hubs and technology. Management also set out targets for the next five years that suggested margins improving to above 5 per cent on annual revenue growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. “Overall, we see the headline numbers as ambitious, as they would imply a significant (greater than 50 per cent) growth in operating profits over the next four years which could make it an attractive investment case should they deliver given recent share price weakness. While we believe that the increased focus in parcels is a welcome development (and should contribute to margin expansion), another key driver of profits will be the productivity growth at the company where there have been some disappointments in the recent past. As such, our first impression is that we believe that the market might want to see the first evidence of the turnround (which could potentially unlock significant value at the company), before giving the company credit for it.”Goldman Sachs ● Marks and Spencer led the FTSE 100 fallers after accompanying in-line annual results with a £600m rights issue to help fund its Ocado joint venture. The retailer said it would expand its share count by a fifth with a cash call at 185p a share, a 28 per cent discount to the 257p theoretical ex-rights price.  M&S explained that it “believes that, given the high operating risk the business faces, it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and cash flow, to provide security and underpin the changes we need to make”. There was little new on the Ocado joint venture other than a comment that it “opens up the possibility of substantially increasing our grocery market share in the medium term”. “Results were broadly as expected given the lack of recent guidance and consensus and impact of the late Easter. However, considering it has a large rights issue coming up and a major transition in the direction of its food business, we had expected a little more feelgood factor in the announcement.”Credit Suisse ● Mondi led the paper and packaging stocks sharply higher after raising containerboard prices for the first time since early 2018. The company told customers overnight that it would be charging €60 a tonne more for testliner, kraftliner and kraft topliner. Smurfit Kappa and DS Smith climbed on expectations they will follow the move.  ● Babcock hit a nine-year low after cutting 2020 guidance by about 5 per cent to reflect a step lower in market conditions.  Full-year results from the industrial services conglomerate were slightly weaker than expected, with underlying revenue down 1.9 per cent and the bid pipeline shrinking slightly to £31bn, while 2020 underlying profit was put on a range of £515m to £535m compared with a £553m consensus. JPMorgan Cazenove and Peel Hunt both downgraded Babcock to “hold” in response. A valuation of less than 7 times 2020 earnings “underlines the markets scepticism towards Babcock at present”, said RBC. “Given the results this morning, there still looks to be much to do in order to convince around the quality of earnings and cash flow in this business.” While there was value to Babcock’s depth of client relationships in markets with high barriers to entry, a record of downgrades underlined management’s struggle to cope with the group’s complexity, RBS said. Sellside stories ● UBS upgraded Moneysupermarket, the price comparison site operator, to “buy” from “neutral” with a 415p target. The market was overly pessimistic on margins, UBS said, because Moneysupermarket’s heavy recent investments should improve customer conversion rates and in the longer term reduce its dependence on search. Between 2015 and 2017 Moneysupermarket sunk £60m into modernising its technology platform and last year the company added £5m to operating costs to expand its product engineering team, UBS said. “2019 and 2020 look to be the years where Moneysupermarket’s efforts start to really pay off in terms of incremental growth and unlocking transactions at a high incremental margin.” UBS forecast Moneysupermarket to deliver more than 7 per cent organic revenue growth in 2020, up from 4.6 per cent last year, on improved margins as the driver moves from search to personalised marketing. A margin recovery back to 2016 levels would deliver double-digit earnings per share growth, it said. ● Liberum upgraded Superdry to “buy” from “hold” with a 600p target price. The broker was encouraged by co-founder Julian Dunkerton’s move to appoint Nick Gresham, formerly of online retailer Wiggle, as interim chief financial officer following his return to the fashion label last month. “It will take time to restore Superdry to being the design-led business we all know it can be, but we are impressed by how swiftly decisions are being made. The appointment of an interim CFO will allow Julian Dunkerton more time to focus on brand and product . . . We believe Superdry offers deep value and while we await more detail [at full-year results due on July 4] around the new strategy, we feel now may be the right time to buy.”Liberum ● In brief: Babcock cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Cie des Alpes downgraded to “hold” at Société Générale; DSV raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Ericsson upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Hastings rated new “sell” at Panmure Gordon; Ryanair cut to “reduce” at HSBC; Sabre Insurance rated new “sell” at Panmure Gordon; Scout24 rated new “underperform” at Merrill Lynch.

"How sale and leaseback deals have unleashed a wave of M&A in casinos","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. “Imagine if The Sacramento Bee bought the Financial Times.” This was the analogy one former executive of Caesars Entertainment offered to describe the $20bn-plus sale of the venerable gaming company last month to Eldorado Resorts, an obscure regional casino outfit out of Reno, Nevada.  This David-buys-Goliath deal had its very own special slingshot: property finance. As Sujeet Indap explains in the FT, borrowing against a property portfolio helped fuel the revolutionary buyout of Harrah’s Entertainment by Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital for $31bn in 2008. That deal relied on an innovative commercial mortgage-backed securities structure that provided almost $7bn of cash. The next innovation in gambling financial engineering was to create standalone companies called real estate investment trusts.  Reits own casinos and adjacent hotels in the trust — known as PropCos — and separate the operating company into another unit, called an OpCo, that runs the day-to-day operations. There are now three gaming Reits with a collective enterprise value of more than $40bn.  In the Eldorado/Caesars deal, Vici Properties — an affiliate of Caesars — is buying a handful of casinos to help the small chain fund the latest deal. It will then rent these properties back to Caesars.  The 2008 buyout famously crashed and burnt over too much debt. The latest deal will leave the new Caesars highly levered again, this time as a tenant. Experts agree that an OpCo bankruptcy would be very complex with a Reit counterparty.  For now, however, the underdog has become the emperor of the Las Vegas Strip. DD’s Sujeet is currently working on a book about Caesars’ bankruptcy saga.

The widening gap between the two houses of Morgan It may be an accepted truth on Wall Street that investment banking fees have already peaked this cycle. Equity and debt underwriting revenues have sputtered for most lenders and competition from boutique merger advisory shops has threatened one of the Street's most lucrative business lines. Oh, and mergers and acquisitions activity has fallen off a cliff in Europe and Asia this year.  So with the second quarter done — and Morgan Stanley finally reporting financial results — we have a better sense of how the slowdown is affecting the bottom line. The midtown Manhattan-based investment bank run by James Gorman suffered a 23 per cent drop in advisory revenues in the first half of the year, pulling in $912m in the period.  It was a far steeper decline than its peers. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase was off 3 per cent and Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all reported gains. The decline at Morgan widened the gap between its advisory business and JPMorgan’s. In the first half of 2018 JPMorgan’s advisory business had generated just $9m more than Morgan Stanley’s. This year the gap stands at $257m in JPMorgan’s favour. Goldman is leading the whole lot: its $1.66bn in revenues is more than 80 per cent ahead of Morgan Stanley’s take and more than 40 per cent above JPMorgan’s haul.  Of course advisory is just one business line; JPMorgan earns far more underwriting debt than Goldman, and Morgan Stanley’s equities franchise remains the biggest on Wall Street. Taken as a whole, JPMorgan generated $17m more in investment banking revenues than Goldman in the first half of 2019.  DD can’t help but wonder if some more-than-temporary shift is under way. The race for advisory mandates between the two houses of Morgan was razor thin in 2018 and 2017, but that’s no longer the case this year.

Mo money, mo (public) deals for private equity What do you do if you find yourself with deep pockets but pricey assets? You hunt for big things to buy elsewhere. Faced with eye-watering multiples for private companies and filled with record amounts of capital, buyout groups are snapping up more public companies now than ever before. The management consulting firm Bain & Company expects an all-time high of 212 so-called take-private transactions in total this year. The previous record of 192 deals was reached in 2007. Almost to prove the point, there have been a spate of deals recently. On Thursday TDR Capital picked up a £3bn bar tab at Ei Group, the UK’s largest pub operator. The private equity firm already owns the Slug and Lettuce chain.  Last month, a consortium led by Blackstone agreed to acquire the leisure group Merlin Entertainments, best known for Legoland Resorts and Madame Tussauds wax museums, in a £6bn deal.  Over in Germany, the private equity groups Bain Capital and The Carlyle Group have agreed to buy the lighting company Osram in a €3.4bn sale. So what’s driving the flurry of deals? Record-low interest rates have helped private equity buyers secure cheap financing for deals.

Mega funds are flush with cash and under pressure to deploy large sums of money in one go. 

Investors see relatively cheap prices in public companies in relation to record high multiples being paid for private companies.

 “Multiples being paid for private companies are at an all-time high and that puts a growing number of publicly traded companies in the scope of what could be potential transactions,” Brenda Rainey at Bain & Company told DD.

"Schroders/family companies: DNA test","Defensive qualities do not make a buy case","You can see the attraction to Schroders of appointing a director experienced in protecting endangered species. Across the UK, tufty-eared local squirrels have been ousted by tough American invaders. Indigenous active managers are suffering an onslaught of their own from US passive fund shops. Leonie Fane, who already sits on the board of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, must surely have knowledge applicable to these other asset gatherers. She owes her appointment to her maiden name of Schroder, however. The Schroders and the Mallinckrodts indirectly control the big UK fund manager. Patriarch Bruno Schroder, Leonie’s father, died recently. The suspicion an era may be ending is deepened by the first year-end decline in assets under management at Schroders since the financial crisis, according to S&P Global data. Fans of cookie-cutter managerial capitalism will decry nepotism. The usual riposte is that family control brings stability and long-term purpose. Shares in groups of this kind have slickly outpaced rivals since 2006, according to Credit Suisse. Schroders, almost half of whose stock is held in trust, has produced investor returns of almost 400 per cent over 10 years. Arguments for and against family-owned companies are equally specious. It is tempting to imagine success results from structure, because the latter is easily observed. We should judge businesses on subtler individual grounds.  After a decade of expansion, the task of Schroders is defensive. Year-end client assets of £421bn will suffer further outflows to low-cost passive managers. Board continuity may come most usefully from Philip Mallinckrodt, another low-profile dynast. He has worked in the company he was once tipped to lead. Schroders has the brands and scale to brake decline harder than rivals, and is thus shorted less by traders. Profits before tax from a wealth management arm that owns the Cazenove brand were £93m, over a tenth of the divisional total. A tie-in with Lloyds should deliver an £80bn boost to assets next year.  Defensive qualities do not make a buy case. Post-tax profits as a percentage of client assets peaked at 15 basis points in 2015. They fell to 12 basis points last year, and will fall further still. Buyers should wait for a market rout to make the shares cheaper. The squirrel-loving Schroders will hold so others do not have to.","07.03.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Galapagos, Sports Direct, Antofagasta, Adecco","Chairman’s £11.6m share sale puts Micro Focus under pressure","Monday 14:30 BST What’s happening ● Galapagos was the Stoxx 600’s biggest gainer after the Belgian drug developer announced an extended collaboration with long-term partner Gilead. The deal broadened Gilead’s access to Galapagos pipeline and small molecule research platform, with the US group taking ex-EU rights to compounds and agreeing to split the funding of late-stage research. In return Gilead agreed to buy 7m Galapagos shares at about a 16 per cent premium to Friday’s price for about $1.1bn, as well as paying $3.95bn upfront in cash and agreeing to up to €1.2bn in milestone payments.  The purchase increased Gilead’s equity stake to 22 per cent, Warrants, if approved, would allow Gilead to lift its ownership to 29.9 per cent with standstill agreement preventing a full takeover for 10 years.  The landmark deal “essentially secures Galapagos’s independence for the next decade and provides funds to accelerate its pipeline,” said Jefferies. “We view the deal and equity premium paid as a welcome endorsement of Galapagos’s pipeline and platform, albeit recognise the 10-year standstill effectively removes any acquisition optionality from the stock.” ● Micro Focus dropped after Kevin Loosemore, the software company’s executive chairman, raised £11.6m by selling more than half his stake. The sale of 650,000 shares followed Micro Focus last week reporting a sharp drop in half-year licence sales. “Until now, all of my assets have been held in Micro Focus shares. Having recently turned 60, it is time for me to diversify a little, although around half my personal wealth remains in the stock,” Mr Loosemore said.  “The optics never look right in that it always seems the wrong time for a company director to sell shares. But in fairness, we are relaxed with the ‘tax purposes’ reason given that Mr Loosemore retains a further circa 640,000 shares. Investors may recall that Mr Loosemore has not sold shares since 2010 when he was financing his house purchase. As investors appreciate, Mr Loosemore is committed to the firm and has said for many years that he will stay as chairman for as long as shareholders would like him too. So yes, the market has gulped at the quantum of the share sale, but we think it is a nice opportunity for someone else to pick up the stock.”Stifel ● Antofagasta rose after the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes awarded $5.84bn in damages to Tethyan Copper Company, its joint venture with Barrick Gold that owns 75 per cent of the Reko Diq copper project in Pakistan. The claim was in relation to arbitration filed against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the unlawful denial of a mining lease. Reko Diq “had fallen away from the markets’ focus in recent years” because of the legal wrangling”, said JP Morgan Cazenove, which said the settlement amount was equivalent to 230p per share or more than a quarter of Antofagasta’s market value.  However, JPMorgan put no value for the settlement in its Antofagasta valuation. It added: “Pakistan’s financial situation is precarious, highlighted by its dependence on an IMF rescue package earlier this year, so its ability to service the award (in full and in a timely manner) is highly questionable. As such, we expect the headline figure should be heavily risked. Furthermore, whilst the award is binding we understand there still remain legal avenues for the government to appeal the procedural process.”  ● Sports Direct was the FTSE 250’s sharpest faller after delaying its annual results. The retailer blamed problems integrating its House of Fraser acquisition and “increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits” including from the Financial Reporting Council. The statement also noted “current uncertainty as to the future trading performance” of House of Fraser.  The audit process still had to address “a number of key areas” that “could materially affect the guidance” given in an interim trading update in December, warned Sports Direct. Peel Hunt called this caution “alarming”.  “Our suspicion is that trading in calendar 2019 has been very poor: weather patterns have been unhelpful and the elevation strategy may have worked for a handful of outlets but the core, untouched store portfolio remains under pressure. It surely has to be the case that group management has taken on too much here. Let’s be clear: we think [chief executive] Mike Ashley is a genius when it comes to sports retail. No doubt about it. However, to make an analogy, he’s trying to coach the England football team whilst running the netball, the tennis and the chess team as well . . . We would consider that an expectations rebase for House of Fraser as not unexpected. For the core to start showing signs of difficulties as well is of major concern.”Peel Hunt Sellside stories ● Jefferies downgraded Swiss staffing company Adecco to “underperform” from “neutral” with a SFr43 target price. Revenue momentum and industrials trends are deteriorating, which has in the past led Adecco to a cyclical trough valuation, Jefferies said.   “Global labour markets struggled in June. China has been impacted by tariff discussions, Benelux data was weak as automotive supply chain issues ripple across Europe, our proprietary Hays job ads data suggest German momentum remained tough into July, French temporary post data softened in June, and (despite the positive overall non-farm payrolls data), there has been no sequential growth in US temp volumes since last autumn.”Jefferies Profit warnings have been a common feature recently among industrials companies, which provide 53 per cent of Adecco’s revenue, said Jefferies. It forecast second-quarter results due on August 8 to show a 3 per cent contraction in organic revenue, a deterioration from earlier in the year, with no improvement expected in the current quarter.  On valuation it said Adecco’s enterprise value was still at 1.9 times net fees, a premium to its cyclical trough of 1.5 times, and lacked the dividend yield support of peers Randstad, Hays and PageGroup. ● In brief: ADO Properties raised to “buy” at HSBC; Cairn Energy cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; Danone cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Ediston Property rated new “buy” at Investec; Elisa cut to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan; P2P Global Investments raised to “hold” at Jefferies; SMCP raised to “buy” at Jefferies; Schroders cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Solvay raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Ubisoft rated new “buy” at Jefferies.

"US bank chiefs veer from financial to political problems","Growth in profits has been accompanied by rising anger among Democrats","Citigroup’s Mike Corbat, left, JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and five other bank chiefs appear before the House financial services committee on Wednesday © AFP The leading US bank chief executives were hauled to Washington this week and mauled before Congress, prompting severe déjà vu. It looked strikingly similar, deliberately so, to a February 2009 hearing before the same House financial services committee during the height of the financial crisis. Then, like now, the top US bankers filed into a gloomy room on Capitol Hill and sat in alphabetical order to answer for their sins during a seven-hour session. Delve beyond the superficial similarities, though, and the dynamics are radically different. In 2009 Democrats held both chambers of Congress. Now, Republicans control the Senate. There is, therefore, little chance of any tougher banking regulations being passed into law. But although the numbers show Congress has shifted to the right, the rhetoric says otherwise.  A decade ago, Democrat Barney Frank was in charge of the hearing. Irascible but witty, sceptical of Wall Street but also wary of wrecking the economy, Mr Frank subsequently helped push through reforms that made the system safer. Now he has retired and the gavel is held by 80-year-old Democratic firebrand Maxine Waters, who excoriated the banks for “chronic lawbreaking” and suggested they should be broken up. The divided Congress means Ms Waters has no chance of legislating — yet. But the items on congressional Democrats’ agenda should be concerning for the banks. In Wednesday’s hearing, Citigroup’s chief executive Mike Corbat was told to “lower your salary or raise the salary of others” to correct a 486:1 ratio between his $24m pay and the average employee’s $49,766. The seven white men were asked “whether your likely successor will be a woman or a person of colour”, and whether their institutions had historically benefited from slavery. They were accused of “duping the American people into believing that you are helping to address climate change” but continuing to provide financing to oil and gas companies. Guns, absent from banking hearings 10 years ago, were mentioned 21 times. Republicans are outraged that the likes of Citigroup and Bank of America have responded to a spate of gun violence by limiting their work with weapons businesses. But JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon was criticised by Democrats for not following suit. For now, ignoring their own past failings, Democratic lawmakers are happy to slam bankers for not changing the country or saving the planet. But if they prevail in the 2020 elections, there are a number of Democratic presidential candidates — led by Senator Elizabeth Warren — who might translate the anti-bank rhetoric and transformative social agenda into action. The considerable consolation for bankers is that the discussion has veered to these topics partly because the banks are obviously healthier. Shortly after the 2009 hearing, Federal Reserve “stress tests” reassured investors that US banks were sound. Since then the S&P 500 is up almost 300 per cent. The returns of all the big banks now exceed their cost of capital, a sharp difference with European banks. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported net income of $9.1bn for the first quarter. That is more than the combined annual profits of Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse. The political storm is still brewing. At least the financial one is clearly over. tom.braithwaite@ft.com

"Euroclear appoints Goldman to assess exits for shareholders","Options for €5.9bn settlement house include listing or private equity sale","One of the world’s biggest securities depositories, Euroclear, has appointed Goldman Sachs to assess options that will allow its shareholders to sell their stakes, according to three people familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs is working with the board of Euroclear to breathe new life into a longstanding plan to create a process for investors to cash out.  That could involve selling Euroclear, which is valued at around €5.9bn, to an industry buyer, to private equity, or via a listing but nothing has been decided, the people said. Goldman and Euroclear declined to comment. Euroclear is a Brussels-based settlement house, a vital part of financial market infrastructure where deals are finalised. It is largely owned by its biggest users and holds more €28tn of assets on behalf of investors. This makes it a huge source of the collateral that is required to back trades. Demand for collateral is expected to rise in coming years as global watchdogs tighten standards. Analysts have long viewed the company as one of the last independent infrastructure operators that could be purchased by an exchange while avoiding competition issues. America’s Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and the London Stock Exchange Group, two of the world’s biggest exchanges, do not have large-scale settlement operations and both have been tipped at potential buyers. However, both have publicly said they would prefer to remain as shareholders. Euroclear’s €5.9bn valuation has been established over the past 18 months as Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse and Société Générale have sold or reduced their stakes in privately-negotiated deals. Many big banks no longer want the regulatory responsibility associated with running systemically-important market infrastructure. ICE and the LSE have bought in, taking holdings of 10 and 5 per cent respectively. Last year, the board of Euroclear’s operating company began exploring more formal ways for other shareholders to cash out, and appointed Moelis to run the process. Goldman is working on behalf of the holding company, and Euroclear disclosed the appointment at an investor day two weeks ago. But the plans are already unpopular with some of Euroclear’s 120 shareholders, which range from JPMorgan and Citigroup to smaller European financial institutions. Some users are wary that Euroclear could raise prices to pay for technology improvements and some European operators fear the process could open the way for US financial institutions to dominate one of the few systemically-important parts of market infrastructure based in the eurozone, according to two people familiar with shareholders’ thinking. Some of the largest private equity groups in Europe have looked at the business but are not willing to buy without a simplification of the ownership structure, two people said. “It’s too big with too many shareholders and too messy for a private equity group to buy,” said an adviser to some of the largest buyout funds in Europe. Euroclear has said they will update shareholders on the process in the second half of the year.","28.03.2019"
"US stocks close at four-month high as investors look to Fed","Market focus trained on any plans for a wind down of Fed balance sheet","Wall Street closed as an over four-month high on Monday as investors awaited the start of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting for fresh insight into US monetary policy. The Fed is expected to rein in predictions for interest rate rises in 2019 at a two-day meeting which begins on Tuesday. Attention will be trained on any plans for a wind down of its balance sheet and central bankers’ economic forecasts.  The S&P 500 overcame a lacklustre start to finish up 0.3 per cent at 2,832.32 — its highest closing level since November 9. The gains were led by bank stocks, which are being boosted by growing speculation that a weak run economic data will not merely ensure the US central bank will keep rates on hold but possibly prompt it to start cutting later this year. Credit Suisse increased its year-end price target on the index to 3,025 from 2,925, pointing to potential upside of around 7 per cent. 
  Expectations for a less hawkish Fed weighed on the dollar, however. The DXY index dipped 0.1 per cent to 96.48 while the yield on 10-year US Treasuries ticked up less than 1 basis point to 2.6015 per cent. It closed under 2.6 per cent on Friday for only the second time since it last regularly traded under that level in January 2018.  The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 closed up 0.1 per cent. London’s FTSE 100 outperformed with a 1 per cent rise. It was helped by fresh sell-off in the pound, which fell as much as 0.7 per cent to $1.3185 after Theresa May’s plan to hold another vote on her Brexit agreement was dealt a severe blow by the Speaker of the House of Commons, who warned that the deal must first undergo substantive changes. China’s CSI 300 stood out, up almost 3 per cent in its biggest single-session gain since early February. There were stubborn hopes that policy moves to boost domestic consumption would come, while the wait for signs of a breakthrough in trade relations with the US continued.  Snapshot

"Wall Street battles for supremacy in volatility market","Asset managers vie to launch replacement for iconic VXX fund","A fight for assets has erupted among volatility funds that allow investors to bet on gyrations in the stock market, as the current market-leading exchange traded product enters its final days. Barclays’ $700m exchange-traded note, known by the ticker VXX, was the first of its kind when it launched in January 2009. The fund buys futures contracts on the Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, which typically rises as equity prices fall. However, unlike more traditional exchange traded funds, ETNs are structured as bonds with a fixed maturity. Barclays is hoping to lure investors to a successor ETN called VXXB when its predecessor dies on January 29, but sharp-elbowed challengers have spotted an opportunity to knock the bank from its pole position. “There is a clash to see who will replace that product,” said Nick Cherney, head of exchange-traded products for Janus Henderson, who was also on the team that first created Barclays’ VXX. “Everybody is competing for that flow.” VelocityShares, an arm of fund manager Janus Henderson, this week clipped fees on a replica product called VIIX to try to lure assets away from Barclays, dropping its “expense ratio” to 70 basis points from 75bp, after cutting the rate from 89bp in June. The move undercuts the 89bp charged on Barclays’ VXX and VXXB products. Barclays is hoping VXX’s size and volume — trading 20 times more frequently than the $161m VIXY, its leading challenger — will encourage investors to migrate to VXXB. Barclays owns the majority of the $184m in assets in its replacement VXXB ETN to boost liquidity and encourage investors to switch from VXX. Yet ProShares, another aggressive ETF provider, is also keen to gather assets for its Vix Short-term Futures ETF, known as VIXY. “It’s a unique opportunity. You have to make hay while the sun shines and right now the sun is shining,” said Ben Fulton, who runs ProShares’ tactical products group. He declined to comment on the prospect of cutting fees for VIXY, which has a 85bp expense ratio. Vix-linked products have became popular with investors in recent years, leading investment groups to launch more than 40 different funds, with VXX and XIV, its mirror-image “short” Vix fund backed by Credit Suisse, by far the most popular. Vix funds that bet on turbulence have seen losses in the years since the crisis as markets have remained largely calm, but that came to an abrupt end in February last year. Exchange traded products that bet on volatility remaining subdued were hit hard, forcing Credit Suisse to shutter XIV. But VXX and similar “long” volatility products saw hefty short-term gains. Indeed, VXX went out with a bang before its scheduled demise, returning almost 68 per cent last year — its only positive year since its birth. A return of market volatility last month has again made attractive the use of Vix-based trading products, said Mr Fulton, raising the stakes for providers jostling to succeed VXX as the primary Vix-linked fund.  “Renewed volatility at the end of the year has accentuated the amount of proprietary trading firms looking at and using it as part of their day-to-day trading,” he said.

"Lyft eyes Nasdaq listing by end of March","Move by US ride-hailing company comes as rival Uber and other tech groups look to go public","Lyft plans to list its shares on Nasdaq as soon as late March in what could be the first of an expected wave of big initial public offerings this year, according to people with knowledge of the plans. The move by the US ride-hailing company comes as the exchanges are locked in a battle to win high-profile tech listings as some of the most prominent and highly valued private Silicon Valley companies line up to list this year. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq was the choice of the biggest companies of previous generations, including Google and Facebook, when they went public, the New York Stock Exchange, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, has boosted its share of marquee tech listings in recent years, winning Spotify, Snap, the owner of Snapchat, as well as Twitter. Lyft’s larger rival Uber is also expected to list as soon as the first half of this year. It is seen as leaning toward Nasdaq’s downtown rival, after hiring Nelson Chai, a former NYSE finance chief, as chief financial officer in August. Lyft, Uber and Nasdaq all declined to comment. The latest crop of tech companies, including Airbnb, Pinterest and Slack, have remained private for longer than earlier start-ups, growing to huge valuations funded by an increasingly deep pool of private capital.  Uber, for example, was valued at $76bn in its most recent private round and is hoping to fetch a public market value of more than $100bn, which would rank it among the biggest US IPOs ever. Both Lyft and Uber filed confidential paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in December. The SEC’s comment and approval process was delayed during the government shutdown at the beginning of the year, but is back on track since the government reopened in late January. Lyft hired JPMorgan Chase as lead underwriter for its IPO with support from Credit Suisse and Jefferies. The company was valued at $15bn in its latest private fundraising. The banks declined to comment or could not be reached. Lyft’s valuation compared with Uber’s reflects its smaller scale: it only operates in the US and Canada, while Uber has a global business and has also pushed into food delivery, freight booking and other business lines. While Lyft holds a lead over Uber in some cities, its national share of the US ride-hailing market was 29 per cent to Uber’s 69 per cent as of December 2018, according to research group Second Measure, which analyses anonymised credit and debit card data. Both companies lose money. Lyft’s net loss reached $373m in the first half of 2018, The Information, a tech website, reported in September. Uber, which discloses some financial information, reported an adjusted loss of $1.8bn for 2018. The timing around Lyft’s IPO was first reported by Reuters.

"Why does Mozambique need to pay its non-odious debt?","In this guest post, Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal of Queen Mary University of London argues that Mozambique policymakers need to act now to clear the country's default.","In this guest post, Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal of Queen Mary University of London argues that Mozambique policymakers need to act now to clear the country's default. The humanitarian tragedy caused by the recent tropical cyclone Idai in Mozambique has exacerbated the country’s economic hardship and made finding a resolution for the country's debt, which has been in arrears for more than two years, even more critical. Before Mozambique can expect to re-enter the international capital markets and access needed financing, Mozambique policymakers must act now to clear this default. Today, two issues need to be addressed: (1) whether any or all of the country's financing arrangements are valid legal obligations; and (2) if eventually they should be repudiated or restructured in the context of negotiations with creditors. In a nutshell, the eurobonds are valid and legally binding obligations of the Republic that need to be honoured. The loans are a different story and a dark cloud of doubt lingers around them. The primary focus should be on the publicly traded eurobonds, because the public market is the most important channel of financing relevant to Mozambique’s economic recovery and it sets a benchmark for the financing needed for the country's LNG projects.  How did we get into this mess? Former president Armando Guebuza and his government established three state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that borrowed $2bn in 2013-14 on the basis that the loans were fully guaranteed by the state. However, only one loan was made public and when the other two were disclosed in 2016, it triggered an economic crisis which brought about a default on all external commercial debt. Since then, evidence of large-scale fraud and bribery has gradually emerged, sparking a lively debate about whether the original loans and guarantees should be repudiated or recognised and restructured.  The original financing arrangements were: (1) a $622m loan to ProIndicus, a state-run security firm, to perform coastal surveillance; (2) a $535m loan to the Mozambique Asset Management Company (MAM) to build and maintain shipyards; and (3) a $850m loan to Ematum, a state-run fishing company, to build a tuna-fishing fleet. All these loans were subject to purported guarantees from Mozambique’s government. The loans were arranged by the banks, VTB and Credit Suisse. Of the three loans, only the one to Ematum was publicly disclosed; later, it was converted into loan participation notes (LPNs), which were traded in open markets. The Ematum LPNs were, in turn, legally extinguished in April 2016 through an exchange for $727m of sovereign eurobonds issued by the Mozambique government — an entirely new legal obligation.  After Mozambique disclosed the existence of these debts, which caused the IMF and bilateral donors to suspend their budgetary support, the local currency depreciated by about 65 per cent within six months and economic growth plummeted to 3.8 per cent in 2016 from 6.6 per cent the year prior.  Worried about the increased levels of debt compared to GDP, the government announced in October 2016 its intention to restructure all of its external commercial debt. In its presentation to creditors, the government noted that while external commercial debt represented only 13 per cent of total external debt, it accounted for over 40 per cent of debt service. But since then, no payments have been made, leading the country's credit profile to be downgraded and the cost of financing to rise.  Making matters even more complicated, the country's administrative auditing court declared the state guarantees of the ProIndicus and MAM loans illegal for violating the constitution and previous budgetary laws. A special commission within the National Assembly arrived at similar findings in November 2016, and about a half a year later, Kroll published its own independent audit report highlighting numerous irregularities in the loan's issuance and use of funds. A New York court followed in December 2018 with several indictments against multiple individuals, including high-level Mozambique officials, for allegedly conspiring to defraud investors through numerous material misrepresentations and omissions. Just a few months later, Mozambique filed a claim in London against Credit Suisse, among others, for its involvement in the ProIndicus financing (domestic indictments were also issued).  The question as to whether to recognise these financing arrangements in whole or in part has been lingering for a while, creating legal uncertainty for current and prospective investors. This uncertainty has constrained the economic recovery (following an incipient partial recovery in 2017), and the provision of needed financing. It is reported that ENH, the state oil and gas company, is contemplating issuing government-guaranteed eurobonds to finance its participation in the LNG project. Until the existing sovereign eurobonds are restructured such an issuance will be impossible at a reasonable cost. Valid legal obligations? While the ProIndicus and MAM loans operated under a cloak of secrecy — as they were used to acquire military equipment for the security services and the Ministry of Defence — the contracting of the Ematum financing was not hidden. The existence of the Ematum LPNs was discussed in various IMF country reports, had been included in the country’s public debt statistics, and these notes were publicly traded and included in JPMorgan’s emerging market bond index. When the LPNs were extinguished and replaced with eurobonds, they were fully disclosed to the Mozambique citizenry and later approved by the National Assembly, counteracting any claims that such publicly listed and publicly traded sovereign eurobonds are ‘tainted’. Another unsupportable argument is that the eurobonds constitute ‘odious debt’ or illegitimate debts. The concept of odious debt has not been upheld in court decisions, and the concept of illegitimate debts has not been conceived as a legal definition but rather encompassing ethical, social, political and economic dimensions. Therefore, it cannot be subject to legal analyses. Consequently, the eurobonds are neither odious nor illegitimate debts. There is no legal basis to question that they are legally binding obligations of the Republic of Mozambique. The situation in Ukraine provides a helpful comparison. Notably, the UK's Court of Appeals recently ruled that Ukraine’s Minister of Finance had the ostensible authority to contract a debt obligation and creditors were not aware of any breach of law, meaning the country was legally bound to repay the issued bonds. Not only were the eurobonds approved by the National Assembly in Mozambique, but investors were not necessarily aware of any previous wrongdoing, undermining any arguments to repudiate the debt. Any theoretical question of awareness could only apply to a now-extinguished obligation. Wasting time with false comparisons  The Mozambican publicly-issued sovereign eurobonds are inappropriately compared with the privately-issued ProIndicus and MAM loans. The former is a completely new obligation with different terms and conditions issued by a new debtor (here, the Republic of Mozambique), which followed due process in their issuance. Moreover, the eurobonds trade in the public bond market. Their legal status is clear.  On the contrary, the latter two loans are still the original obligations, unchanged and with all their initial ‘questionable’ elements still in place. They trade (if at all) in privately non-disclosed sales, making their legal status more complicated. If the alleged offences included in the indictments are confirmed in a court of law, they would constitute a crime under domestic (or international) law, and Mozambique could have a stronger civil case and a recovery action against the relevant counterparts. However, none of this would be relevant to or affect the validity of the eurobonds. If anything, as noted by US indictments, the eurobonds’ prospectus failed to adequately disclose the existence of the ProIndicus and MAM loans or their maturity dates. This amounts to omissions and misrepresentations, which potentially could give raise to a civil claim for damages by the eurobond holders against Mozambique.  Normalising relations with the international bond markets is very much in the interest of Mozambique. An essential step includes the clear recognition of the legality of the eurobonds and some kind of debt restructuring. Indeed, after negotiations between bondholders and the government, an agreement in principle for restructuring the eurobonds was announced in November 2018. This restructuring would normalise relations with the public bond markets, which in turn would support more rapid economic recovery, growth and directly facilitate the financing which the national oil and gas company desperately needs. There is no place for the government now to second-guess its next steps based on unsupported arguments.  Mozambique’s concern should focus on fixing its own economic problems and putting bad practices behind it. Even the aftermath of the tragic cyclone further underscores the need for Mozambique to restore its collaboration with the international donor and finance community. Accountability and transparency are quintessential for any nation. Stemming corruption, strengthening economic management and implementing a feasible economic recovery program should be the focus. The opportunity window for new investments might close, so there is no time to waste. Mozambique has a clear light at the end of the tunnel due to the very large fiscal cash flows expected from its LNG projects. Finalising agreements and implementing policies supporting the country's financing and development should be of paramount importance.","04.04.2019"
"Pressure on Saudi families complicates Aramco IPO","Riyadh’s strong-arming of people into backing oil group’s listing risks undermining its credibility","Saudi Arabia’s decision to pressure wealthy families in the kingdom to back the listing of its state oil giant is the latest sign Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has one underlying message: show me the money.  Even before last weekend’s devastating attack at the heart of the Saudi energy industry, the kingdom was trying to raise cash to fund the transformation of its economy. A stock market listing for Saudi Aramco has long been seen as the centrepiece of Prince Mohammed’s vision, with proceeds to be funnelled into sectors beyond oil that will propel the kingdom’s economy into the future.  The government believes securing the support of the country’s wealthiest families will prop up Saudi Aramco’s valuation to the $2tn figure that Prince Mohammed is said to covet. But such an aggressive approach could ultimately prove counterproductive to its long-term trading performance. Saudi Arabia’s government has denied it is pressuring investors. “Whether we invest all depends on the valuation,” said one regional financier, who regards a valuation of $1.4tn-$1.5tn as fair. “The stock will drop if you sell it expensive — you can never control the stock market.” One person briefed on the transaction said Saudi Arabia will seek to allocate 20 per cent of the listed shares to the local families. A similar level will also be apportioned to state pension funds and international investors. The remainder should be allocated to retail investors, with local bankers saying strong interest is expected as Saudis seek a stake in the kingdom’s main revenue earner. This IPO tactic is all about repatriating wealthSaudi financier “It’s Aramco!” said one banker, riffing on the company’s reputation as the world’s most profitable. “The name is enough to hook retail investors, who will be particularly eager if the biggest local investors are also in on the deal.” International investors may be less keen, even as some of the world’s biggest banks with almost endless rosters of wealthy clients have lobbied their way into roles for the IPO. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are among those expected to start a roadshow soon to drum up interest, but many potential investors have said they are wary. Leaning on wealthy Saudi nationals is unlikely to quell their fears. “I think this all fits into a pattern of behaviour,” said Greg Priddy, a former energy analyst for the US government, who has advised banks and hedge funds for more than a decade. “The issue isn’t the company. Aramco is a well-run professional outfit with great capabilities. The problem is the country it’s in, who rules it, and his whims. There’s clearly huge pressure under way to get to the $2tn valuation he’s asserted, but the strategy boils down to ‘His Royal Highness commands it’.”  As of now, Saudi Aramco is considering a listing of up to 3 per cent of the company on the Tadawul exchange in Riyadh, including the portion allocated to investors such as the wealthy families, raising a potential $60bn for the kingdom. But the listing could still be limited to a 1 per cent sale. Saudi Aramco declined to comment. Wealthy families, including many of the hundreds of royals and business magnates who were brought into the Ritz-Carlton during the crown prince’s anti-corruption probe, are a key element of ensuring a successful, oversubscribed offering, bankers said.   One of those approached to become a key investor is said to be Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the highest profile business magnates detained during the crown prince’s graft purge. Along with other “guests”, the billionaire investor was released from the Ritz after reaching financial settlements that the government said had netted more than $100bn in asset transfers to the state. If international demand is lower than expected, the government is expected to ask the segment of rich Saudis to make up any shortfall, said one banker working on the deal. One person familiar with the process said some families believe they are already overexposed to the energy sector by virtue of living in the Middle East. “These are very big sums of money that they are after,” he said.  Saudi Arabia, which derives its influence from its huge oil reserves, had planned to showcase the world’s most profitable company to the full glare of international investors, confident it could match up to the biggest oil and gas majors. While Saudi Aramco is renowned for its operational prowess and has overhauled its accounts and operations to prepare itself for outside investors, recent events have reaffirmed its position as an arm of the Saudi state.  Despite its reputation for managing the production and refining for the world’s largest crude oil exporter, strong-arming wealthy families into buying the company risks undermines its credibility, said two people close to Saudi Aramco, suggesting some disquiet within the company about the strategy. Suudi officials sought to convince investors of Aramco's durablity and ability to bounce back quickly from the attacks ahead of the IPO © VIDEOS OBTAINED BY REUTERS As part of his scramble for cash Prince Mohammed has sought to accelerate the IPO process and has given greater influence to the Public Investment Fund, his chosen vehicle for executing his economic reforms. The fund’s head Yasir al-Rumayyan is now chairman of Saudi Aramco, replacing industry veteran Khalid al-Falih in a ruthless reshuffle that has alarmed some Saudis and global investors.  One Saudi financier said there was a bigger aim, with the kingdom looking to effectively clawback money into the country that wealthy Saudis might once have invested overseas, in London property or offshore funds.  “This IPO tactic is all about repatriating wealth,” the financier said, pointing out that moving large sums of money out of the country had already become harder after the Ritz-Carlton crackdown. Large remittances and payments have been closely monitored by banks and the state.   Last weekend’s attacks have heightened the sense of urgency. While the kingdom has claimed its finances will not be affected, with Aramco releasing oil in storage to keep sales to customers going, having production offline will ultimately hit its bottom line. Mr Rumayyan and Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman — MBS’s half brother — have gone to great efforts this week to convince investors of Aramco’s durability and ability to bounce back quickly from the attacks ahead of the IPO. Edward Moya, an oil analyst at Oanda, said the kingdom faces an uphill struggle. With Saudi defences breached by what the US have said were Iranian missiles and drones, investors would view the threat of a future attack as “a continued risk to Aramco’s source of revenues”. Saudi Arabia has nevertheless indicated it wants to push ahead. The nine banks appointed as global co-ordinators of the IPO are set to send analysts to Saudi Aramco’s headquarters in the eastern province of Dhahran next week. Company executives are set to present their investment narrative to the bankers who will then write the research reports used to market the stock to institutional clients, as early as next month.  Before the attacks two bankers working on the deal had said that trying to list this year was optimistic. Since last weekend the company has emphasised it will still be within the next 12 months.  Saudi Aramco's IPO challenges explained   Fears exist that the strategy of leaning heavily on wealthy Saudi families could distort how advisers conduct the IPO process.  While the primary focus has become the initial listing on the domestic Tadawul stock exchange, bankers and advisers had been operating on the assumption that the company was keeping the option of an international listing later on, in an established market such as New York, London or Tokyo. That could become more complicated if wealthy investors in the kingdom are seen to have been lent on.  Saudi Aramco opens gates to struck sites Saudi Aramco has revealed the extent of damage to oil sites hit by last weekend’s attacks as the state group seeks to show it is on top of repairs to facilities crucial to the global economy. At the Khurais oilfield 150km north-east of Riyadh, crews in white protective suits cleaned up spillage under the desert sun, with temperatures reaching 40C. Reporters were shown two gas-oil-separation plants, which are essential for stabilising the extracted crude. Both sustained significant damage, with one tall stabilisation column blackened by what Aramco executives say was a direct missile hit. Mohammed al-Suwayegh, head of the production facility at Khurais, described how Aramco fire trucks had raced to the scene in the early hours last Saturday after the missile and drone attacks began. “As they reached the site they saw other rockets hit,” he said. Workers were applying fixes to the structures on Friday, with the company keen to show it can meet the oil ministry’s pledge to restore production quickly. In the world’s largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq, not far from the Gulf coast, five stabilisation columns that separate hydrogen sulphites were damaged.  The site is still being assessed to decide whether to repair or replace the equipment but officials said the plant had been built to survive damage to specific parts.  Spherical steel tanks, which depressurise the crude, have been badly damaged. Aramco is designing plates to repair the damaged sections, to be built by its local contractors. Khalid al-Buraik, head of Aramco operations in the region that includes Abqaiq, pointed to the facility’s “full parking lot” despite heading into a long weekend for Saudi Arabia’s National Day on Monday.  One Aramco official at Khurais, showing off a pipe riddled with shrapnel holes, said the company was “working like a beehive day and night” to restore operations.

"Man Group urges investors to back Jersey move","Holding group in tax haven will free global operations from UK regulatory oversight","Man Group has urged shareholders to sign off its plan to set up a holding company in Jersey, after the alternative investment specialist won regulatory approval for the move. The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to Man’s proposal, which the London-listed group said would free its global operations from British regulatory oversight. Man said it did not expect the arrangement to affect its tax rate as it would still be domiciled in the UK for tax purposes but market-watchers suggested the move would bring advantages.  “This added ‘flexibility’ will make it easier to access potential tax savings structures, such as easier sharing of tax losses between entities, especially in the US,” said David McCann, an analyst at Numis. Man’s chairman, Ian Livingston, wrote to shareholders last week asking them to back the plan at the company’s annual meeting on May 10. Man needs the support of shareholders that own 75 per cent of its stock. This would allow the group to set up the structure later that month. Big shareholders in Man include Franklin Templeton, Silchester, BlackRock and Standard Life Aberdeen. Analysts expect the vote to pass with little resistance. Man would still be listed on the FTSE 250 index. The UK and European businesses would continue to be regulated by the FCA and report into the Jersey holding company, while the US and Asian entities would report directly into the holding company and bypass the UK regulator. “At present, Man’s businesses in the US and Asia are prudentially regulated by the UK authorities as well as local regulators,” Lord Livingston wrote to shareholders. “The proposed structure would result in the group no longer being subject to global consolidated capital requirements and would therefore provide the group with greater flexibility going forward comparable to other such global groups.”  The FCA has taken an increasingly tough stance on the asset management industry after a hard-hitting government investigation two years ago. Last week, for example, the FCA said it would publish profit margins of investment groups and increase its scrutiny of the fees charged by active managers.  Analysts said the reorganisation offered other advantages. “The proposed structure would result in Man Group no longer being subject to global consolidated capital requirements and would thereby provide it with greater flexibility comparable to other such global groups,” wrote Jon Peace, an analyst at Credit Suisse. Man said it was following international best practice. Janus Henderson, the New York and Sydney-listed group, has a similar structure, with a holding company registered in Jersey. Henderson Group set up the Jersey entity in 2008. Janus Henderson is tax-domiciled in the UK. Fidelity International, the sister company of US manager Fidelity Investments, is registered in Bermuda. Fidelity said it paid taxes in all the countries in which it operated and did business. Man said there would be no effect on its London operations, although Robyn Grew, the group’s chief operating officer and general counsel, would relocate to the US as part of the restructure. The company said the impetus for the change was its increased business in North America. “I believe part of the rationale is to make it easier for them the manage the group and in particular acquisitions in the US should they wish to do more in the future,” said Mr McCann. “The other component is to create greater distributable reserves to allow for less disruption to the dividend in event of distributions in excess of statutory profits.”  This month, Man reported a $3.8bn increase in assets under management in its first-quarter results to $112bn thanks to market returns, despite $700m net outflows.","21.04.2019"
"Opening Quote: BA faces £183m fine over the theft of customer data","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.  Pity British Airways (well, almost). Last year, the UK data protection watchdog handed Facebook a £500,000 fine for “serious breaches” linked to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. British Airways now faces a £183m bill from the Information Commissioner's Office over the theft of more than half a million customers' financial details last summer.  Facebook was fined under the old regime, before the EU General Data Protection Regulation came into force last May. Then £500,000 was the maximum penalty the ICO could impose. BA had the misfortune to be hacked when the new rules were in force, and the watchdog is flexing its muscles accordingly. The proposed £183m fine is equal to 1.5 per cent of BA's worldwide turnover for 2017. BA isn't going to accept the fine without a fight. The airline's chair and chief executive, Alex Cruz, says he is “surprised and disappointed”. BA found no evidence of fraud or fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft. Willie Walsh, chief executive of parent company International Airlines Group, says they will “defend the airline's position vigorously”, including through appeals.  Despite the high headline number, it could be worse. The ICO can fine companies up to 4 per cent of global turnover in certain circumstances. Maybe BA should see £183m as not so bad after all.  Briefly  Imperial Brands has dropped a 10 per cent dividend growth target, as it invests in developing “next generation products” such as e-cigarettes. Instead it has committed only to increasing the annual payout through a so-called progressive dividend policy. It will also do a £200m share buyback before the year is out. Imperial Brands has to bring down its net debt/earnings ratio, and cutting dividend growth target will help — but analysts still have questions about how much this latest plan will really do to help.  Photo-Me International, a British company that operates photo kiosks and launderettes, will delay publishing its annual accounts by two weeks because of higher levels of scrutiny required by a new auditor. The group cut ties with its long-term auditor KPMG last year for “commercial reasons”. Today, Photo-Me said its accounts would not be published on July 9, as scheduled, because new auditor Grant Thornton needed more time to “complete its work, together with the recent introduction by the auditor of enhanced internal regulatory scrutiny.” Finally, Metro Bank's controversial chairman is under pressure to set an exit date. Senior executives have been pushing Vernon Hill to outline when he will step down amid fears about potential regulatory actions, according to people close to the bank. But Hill, who co-founded the bank, is reluctant to leave, setting up a potential clash with executives later this year.  Job moves Former Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao has joined private equity house General Atlantic as a special adviser. It's on the hunt for deals in the technology and consumer sector, an area where Colao has plenty of experience after transactions with Verizon Wireless and Liberty Global.  Michael Sherwood, who co-headed Goldman Sachs International, is heading to fintech Revolut. He is expected to be named as a non-executive at the digital bank this week.  Julius Baer
 has named internal candidate Philipp Rickenbacher as its new chief executive, ending a long period of speculation as to who would become the permanent head of the bank. Current chief executive Bernhard Hodler's appointment, made in late 2017, was always meant to be temporary. He took the role when Boris Collardi made the shock move to rival Pictet, and Hodler is now retiring. Rickenbacher takes over on September 1. Amanda Blanc's exit from Zurich Insurance, announced last week, was apparently due to a personality clash with chief executive Mario Greco. She left after just eight months in the job.

"The luxury golf courses catering to the global elite","High-end golf courses are the latest luxury good sold as offering an aura of exclusivity","Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey, US (pictured above), is one of the most expensive places to play the sport in the world. The staff are cagey when asked about membership fees but eventually explain there is a non-refundable initiation fee of between $300,000 and $400,000, plus annual dues of about $30,000. This is a course former US PGA [Professional Golfers’ Association] Tour commissioner Tim Finchem described as “one of the most stunning settings for professional golf there is on the planet”. Even so, $300,000-$400,000 is roughly six times the US median pre-tax income. That said, if you are one of the American ultra-wealthy, the fee is easily affordable. According to the US think-tank the Economic Policy Institute the average annual income of the country’s wealthiest 0.1 per cent was $2.8m in 2017. Liberty is one of the world’s elite golf clubs, along with others such as Wentworth and Beaverbrook in south-east England, Augusta National in the southern US state of Georgia, Loch Lomond in Scotland, and Iwate Hirono in Japan. Their annual fees tend to start around £10,000 a year and come on top of sizeable joining fees — often in six figures. By contrast, the cost of an average full golf club membership in England is £901, according to a 2018 England Golf survey. High-end golf courses are the latest luxury good, offering exclusivity and a place to network. They also host prestigious professional tournaments. Golf, according to the Wealth-X 2019 High Net Worth Handbook, is the sport ultra-wealthy individuals are most interested in. It’s about the experience. Also accessibility: people want to be able to play when they wantMichael Duffy, sales and marketing manager, Centurion Club Exclusivity works in other ways too: a golf course is not like other luxury brands in that it cannot churn out more of its “product” and thus risk devaluing itself in the way a high-end fashion label might. Rather, as long as clubs maintain their standards, limited membership ensures their exclusivity grows. True, a golf club owner can build more courses, but this takes time, as it does for a new course to grow its reputation. A club such as Augusta (host of the US Masters major tournament each spring) did not acquire its mystique overnight, no matter how perfect its greens are. Meanwhile, the new rich from countries such as China and India want the kind of status symbols wealthy westerners have long enjoyed, including high-end golf. Elite golf courses traditionally have been found in locations where golf is popular and wealthy people live, or will visit, in sufficient numbers — countries such as the UK, the US, Ireland and Japan, and a few outliers such as Hong Kong and Singapore. But clubs for the super-rich are springing up in new venues. The first all-grass championship course in the Middle East, the Emirates Golf Club, opened in Dubai in 1988, and the region has become a climatically unlikely golf destination. The Mission Hills resort in Shenzhen, China, was established in 1992 and now has no fewer than 12 courses. Tiers of membership go up to the Chartered Diamond category, costing Rmb2.6m ($384,000). A 2014 KPMG report found the region with the highest average cost of golf course construction was the Middle East and north Africa. This, it suggested, may be because these regions are seeking to attract wealthy golf tourists, although it also noted that “new luxurious facilities have been developed in countries including Russia, Belarus, as well as Poland and Bulgaria”.

Shadow Creek near Las Vegas lets guests of MGM Resorts play — for a $500 fee per round. Visitor numbers are very limited and access is only available from Monday to Thursday. Similarly, Pebble Beach in California calls itself “the no. 1 public golf course in America”, but a round costs from $550 before any extras, with rooms at the resort starting at about $800 per night. In the UK, high-end golf clubs are clustered in two places — in London’s wealthy commuter belt where they are convenient for the capital’s rich, and Scotland. The latter is where the modern game of golf originated — it has been played at St Andrews Links on the east coast for 600 years. In the US, elite clubs tend to be in or near major cities (such as Liberty, which offers views of the Manhattan skyline), although, as in Scotland, many are destinations in their own right. Darren Clarke plays during the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond.  Scotland's reputation as the home of golf bring international attention.  Former US president Barack Obama at St Andrews © Getty But what do the global wealthy get for their money? “It’s more about [the] experience than anything else,” says Michael Duffy, sales and marketing manager of Centurion Club near St Albans, an affluent commuter town north of London. “There’s also accessibility. People want to be able to play when they want to play.” To this end, he explains, the club limits the number of members and only allows members’ guests (as opposed to walk-in visitors). This is a key point: at many mainstream courses, there will be congestion at peak times. At elite courses there may be a long waiting list to join, but the course will not be crowded. “Our members tend to be drawn from a north London demographic. We’ve got a lot of people in [financial] roles — entrepreneurs, hedge fund managers,” Duffy adds. Indeed, having fellow members from the global wealthy is one of the big draws. Many of the world’s most expensive clubs number billionaires, ex-presidents and other luminaries among their members. Tycoons Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are members of Augusta, for example. In fact, it took Gates several years to get in, and the club only began admitting women in 2012, starting with former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and investor and philanthropist Darla Moore. Bubba Watson of the United States plays during the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club on April 13, 2019  The Wisley is another elite club in London’s commuter belt. It is located next to the colourful Royal Horticultural Society gardens in an area densely populated with golf courses. Membership fees are “in the tens of thousands” of pounds a year, according to the club, which has an unusual public-company structure, with its 700 members being shareholders. The fees, says Ian Cox, the Wisely’s development director, go to maintaining “hundreds of acres of turf — the best turf conditions”. He says even the rough — the unmanicured parts of the course — is carefully managed. “The point of it is the pursuit of the finest possible play.” Many of the top clubs take this to extreme lengths. A New Yorker magazine feature on Augusta described “a vast network of pipes and mechanical blowers, which help drain and ventilate the putting greens. When the fans blow one way, they provide air to the densely seeded bent grass of the putting surface. This promotes growth. When the fans are reversed, they create a suction effect, and leach water from the greens. This promotes firmness.” Condoleezza Rice in her Augusta National club jacket © David Cannon/Getty Images Clubs’ amenities, too, stretch far beyond golf. Extras can include excellent restaurants, spas and pools, making them places to entertain business contacts. Many clubs have reciprocal arrangements with similar ones abroad. “Our membership gives you access to clubs in places ranging from Hong Kong to Spain,” says Centurion Club’s Duffy. This level of luxury is reflected in the building and upkeep costs. KPMG’s report said that “in some cases, the cost of a high-end golf course can be as much as five times more than a course of lower quality”. Liberty, according to The New York Times, cost $250m to build. Yet outside the high-end scene, golf is a sport in decline. According to a report by the Pellucid Corp, which provides data on the industry, the number of regular golfers in the US fell from 30m to 20.9m between 2002 and 2016, while in the UK a recent Golf Monthly magazine headline asked: “Why did so many golf clubs close in 2018?” A frequently cited reason is that golfers are an ageing demographic and are not being replaced. There is plenty of concern in the industry that millennials do not play golf. Explanations range from the financial — that twenty- and thirtysomethings are struggling under high levels of debt and therefore cannot afford to take up the sport — to the social: a lack of interest in playing four-hour games. However, if the past 20 years have taught us anything, it is that the struggles of middle and upper-middle earners do not mean there is trouble at the top. Credit Suisse notes that since the 2008 financial crisis, the wealthiest 1 per cent have fared better than the rest. In golf, though, there may be change.

"Too good to be bad: the misplaced focus on recession risks","Risk/reward balance in equities remains tilted towards the latter","Many commentators are extremely suspicious about the foundations that underpin the bull market © AP Many investors are so focused on monitoring potential recession signals that they may overlook evidence to the contrary.  The world economy is not heading towards an imminent recession. It is instead exiting a temporary cyclical slowdown that began in mid-2018. Fiscal stimulus measures in China and more accommodative monetary policy in the US are having a positive impact and helping to steady the global economy. Recent leading economic indicators in both countries confirm this view, pointing to a pick-up in economic activity this quarter.  Even so, many investors remain on the sidelines. Some may still be wary after the hefty sell-off during the fourth quarter of 2018. Others may believe that the subsequent first-quarter rally across all major global indices was too good to be true and that a US recession lies ahead, with the recent inversion of the yield curve providing an apparent warning sign in this regard.  It is arguably not the time to be risk-averse. Valuations have obviously got richer in the past few months. The risk/reward balance in equities remains tilted towards the latter — provided that the global economy does indeed work its way out of the mini cycle slowdown and major central banks keep interest rate hikes on hold.  That being said, one should not expect a return to the boom times of 2017. Any further gains in equity markets in coming months are unlikely to compare to the remarkable Q1 2019 performance.  After all, the global economy is currently in the late stages of an extended economic cycle, and growth is likely to slow from its peak. We expect global economic growth of 2.8 per cent this year compared with 3.2 per cent in 2018.  Recent improvements in manufacturing indices in China and the US are a case in point. In China, the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) advanced to 50.5 in March, crossing the key 50 level back into expansion territory. In contrast, China’s PMI reached 52.4 in September 2017.  In the US, an index of factory activity compiled by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) also improved in March, rising to 55.3, which remains in the growth zone but is clearly lower than the reading of 60.8 achieved in September 2017.  Together, the US and China account for more than half of global economic growth and thus provide a solid indication about the state of the global economy. The good news is we can expect moderate growth for the foreseeable future, and, crucially, tame inflation to go along with it.  A world with central banks on hold provides a very good backdrop for financial markets just as growth starts to pick up once again. Risky assets, especially equities, should continue pushing upwards in the months to come.  A recession will emerge at some point — it is a normal part of the economic cycle. But we see a low probability of a US recession within the next 12 months, not least because household leverage remains moderate.  There are of course risks that should be taken seriously. Global organisations such as the International Monetary Fund continue to scale back their expectations for global growth. Trade remains a key risk as the US and China have yet to resolve their differences and the US-European trade tensions may intensify. In addition, UK-EU relations remain uncertain as the two parties await a Brexit breakthrough. Finally, the recent US yield curve inversion — viewed as a recession bellwether — has unsettled investors.  Despite these uncertainties, it would be premature for investors to declare the end of the cycle.  Michael Strobaek is global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse

"Goldman Sachs has a fix for fixed income trading","Under new chief David Solomon, the bank is overhauling its sputtering profit engine","In the aftermath of the financial crisis, as most trading houses licked their wounds and put safety before sales, Goldman Sachs chose a different path.  “You see Morgan Stanley cutting, European banks . . . who knows what they’re doing? And you think: ‘Let’s go for it!’” recalls one former Goldman partner who worked in its trading division at the time, describing a “deeply rooted” mission to “capitalise on others’ weakness”. A decade on, the trading weakness is most obvious within Goldman’s famous fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) division, once the engine of the most profitable bank on Wall Street.  FICC’s contribution to Goldman’s group-wide revenue peaked at just over 52 per cent — or $23.3bn — in 2009. Last year, FICC generated $5.9bn of revenues, as it fell to just 16.1 per cent of group-wide revenue, its lowest level in at least 20 years. The decline since 2016 is 22 per cent, worse than peers. Facing a crescendo of calls to “fix” FICC, David Solomon, the new chief executive who has no ties to the trading side of the business, is changing course.  The need to replace hedge fund clients Mr Solomon is not suddenly copying the slash-and-burn approach of many rivals — although he has reduced risk-taking and cut some jobs. Instead, true to his background as an investment banker, he is trying to schmooze a broader range of clients.  In place of the hedge funds, who used to be core clients until they suffered their own prolonged slump, Goldman is reaching for alternatives. Asset managers accounted for 28 per cent of Goldman’s FICC revenues in the first half of 2017. Banks and brokers accounted for about 21 per cent of the client base. Non-financial corporations made up 16 per cent of FICC revenue. All these were seen as growth areas, as Goldman looked to diversify. To do this, Mr Solomon is gambling that Goldman can do new things: from adding cash management services typically offered by commercial banks to opening up its technology platform in the same way as Google Maps has done for Lyft, the ride-hailing app. Jim Esposito, co-head of the securities division: ‘We continue to look for places to build scale efficiently while deepening and broadening our client franchise’  “None of this has been a revolutionary change for the firm or the securities division,” said Jim Esposito, co-head of the securities division, of the initiatives Goldman has undertaken in its trading business since Mr Solomon took over this year. “We continue to look for places to build scale efficiently while deepening and broadening our client franchise.”  While lacking the drama of Morgan Stanley’s decision to axe 25 per cent of its fixed income traders in 2015 or UBS’s decision to shut most of its FICC division in 2012, the changes under Mr Solomon nevertheless mark a decisive turning point for Goldman.  So, too, does Mr Solomon’s recent assertion that the bank is alert to the “secular” changes in the FICC market, where revenues across the top 12 players more than halved in the decade since 2009, according to data from industry monitor Coalition. Mr Solomon’s predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein, who entered the firm in 1982 as a manager in its commodities trading brokerage, never budged from the line that the FICC market was in a cyclical dip that would end. Recent personnel changes have gone much deeper than just Mr Blankfein, who ran Goldman for 12 years until his retirement last October. Pablo Salame, a Blankfein confidant regarded as the most powerful of Goldman’s three FICC co-heads, left the bank in May 2018, soon after Mr Solomon was anointed, as did another co-head Isabelle Ealet, who was known as “the commodities queen”. Mr Esposito now shares the role with the surviving co-head Ashok Varadhan, a 21-year Goldman veteran, and Marty Chavez, Goldman’s former chief financial officer.  More significant than the internal changes are Goldman’s external efforts. Several years ago Mr Blankfein began holding “chairman’s forums” where he and senior executives would espouse the importance of a client-focused approach.  At the time, some traders were unconvinced, noting that their bonuses still seemed to move in tandem with their contribution to the profit and loss account. “We all knew that at the end of the year, all that mattered was P&L,” said one. From the customer side, one large asset manager recalls how, as recently as five years ago, “Goldman Sachs would come here every year and they would say that they want to do more business with us and that we were a trusted ‘counterparty’”. It was received badly: “They were missing the boat, there’s a difference between a client and a counterparty.” More recently, the asset manager began to see a difference. Goldman was sharing technology and ideas and expressing an interest in trying to solve his problems. “Of all the sell-side firms, they probably have turned that ship around more than anybody else,” he said. He has significantly increased the business he does with Goldman in the last two years.  Betting on cash management and technology New services are one draw. Most of Goldman’s rivals have divisions that offer cash management and treasury functions. “Those platforms send a bunch of captive revenue into FICC, and we just don't compete,” Mr Solomon said at a Credit Suisse conference in February.  Goldman is building its own cash management division, first for its in-house needs and then for outside clients from 2020. “Good luck to them,” said a senior markets executive at a rival investment bank, noting that such businesses usually take decades to build. Former Goldman chief Lloyd Blankfein never budged from the line that the FICC market was in a cyclical dip that would end © Bloomberg Goldman sees mastery of technology as an accelerant, much as it has quickly built a sizeable retail bank by investing in a clean website and avoiding the bricks-and-mortar branches that encumber rivals. “There are things that clients aren't getting from those big players — the technology and data analytics. With a white sheet of paper we think we can really solve their problem,” Mr Solomon said in February.  Some clients already connect directly with Goldman through its digital trading and risk management platform Marquee, which Mr Esposito describes as “our digital storefront for institutional investors”, with 13,000 monthly active users. “Our ambition is large,” said Mr Esposito. “Longer term we want every existing Goldman Sachs institutional and corporate client to use Marquee and we’re optimistic this platform will attract many new clients too.”  Greater use of technology is supposed to improve efficiency across the business. Ezra Nahum, co-head of Goldman’s securities engineering division, said one of the biggest change since Mr Solomon took over is the “front to back” strategy which requires trading executives to take responsibility for the entire life cycle of a trade, rather than just focusing on bringing in business. Another executive said: “Lloyd wanted the front office to think about revenue. David, he deals with companies [as an investment banker], he has an understanding of the cost of production.” 

 A catastrophic failure of imagination? The cause of the fall in Goldman's FICC business — and the management’s reaction to it — remains a contested topic among current and former Goldman executives. The most popular narrative is that Goldman simply suffered a catastrophic failure of imagination, remaining blindly committed to FICC long after post-crisis regulations made swaths of the business uneconomic. Goldman executives have been at pains to stress, though, that they did not stand still for the past decade. Mr Solomon told investors at the Credit Suisse conference: “We probably haven’t talked about it as much as we should, but we’ve got our risk-weighted assets down meaningfully, we took our expenses in that business down meaningfully. We took the senior headcount in that business down meaningfully.” Some data have dribbled out. A presentation in 2017 showed Goldman cut pay in FICC by 30 per cent from 2012 to 2016, and FICC’s credit and markets “risk-weighted assets” — an indicator of how much capital the division consumes — fell 50 per cent from June 2013 to June 2017.  Still, a recent report from analysts at Citigroup lends weight to the theory that Goldman was behind the curve. Citi’s number crunchers calculated that between 2012, when post-crisis regulations really began to bite, and 2015, Goldman reduced the daily “value at risk” — how much the bank stands to lose in normal market conditions — by just 12 per cent in its FICC business compared with a 39 per cent reduction from a sample of eight of the biggest FICC traders. The moderate risk reduction looks even starker when compared with the 26 per cent reduction in the revenue of the FICC business over the same period, supporting the argument that the returns in Goldman’s FICC business went into freefall because much of the business simply did not make sense in the post-crisis regulatory environment.  Notably, commodities trading, the area that Mr Blankfein worked in earlier in his career, was a traditional Goldman strength but one that was heavily damaged by post-crisis regulation.  Some insiders see the world differently. “The whole regulatory environment change was an excuse, it’s not the reason the business isn’t performing as well as it used to,” said one former FICC executive. He believes the biggest impact of regulation — and the reason for the demise of Goldman’s FICC business — was an “obsession” with return on equity which he dates to about 2015. Another executive, however, defended the approach. “We were covering the downside risk while other banks were winging it,” he said. A Goldman spokesman said it was “focused both on the efficient use of capital and improving the client experience. The two are synergistic, not mutually exclusive.” For his part, Mr Esposito does not see his new boss’s reference to a “secular” decline in FICC as a seminal moment. “We’re a decade into QE [quantitative easing] and its resulting impact on financial markets,” he said. “Of course the debate rages on about how much of a drag are cyclical versus structural forces. We’re simply focused on the things we can control, the rest will be what it will be”.","11.04.2019"
"Asia tech companies fuel $23bn convertible bonds boom","Flood of offerings in first quarter illustrates shift among fast-growing groups","Cash-hungry Asia technology companies are experimenting with new financing tools to raise money, feeding a $23bn boom in the convertible bond market. The flood of offerings this year for the equity-linked products illustrates a shift in how fast-growing tech groups, especially in China, approach initial public offerings and raising capital. The amount of convertible bonds issued by Asian tech companies in the region in the first quarter of 2019 is already more than half of last year’s total, at nearly $3bn, according to data from Dealogic. Convertible bond issuance by Asia companies globally hit an all-time high of more than $23bn in the first three months of this year.  After a spurt of listings in late 2017 and in 2018, including smartphone maker Xiaomi, online video portal iQiyi and ecommerce platform Pinduoduo, a new dynamic has started to emerge across Asia. “Many entities in the previous decade really saw the IPO as the finish line rather than the starting line. Few would return to the market and raise additional proceeds. Today’s growth companies are entrepreneurial and they need a lot of capital,” said Aaron Arth, Goldman Sachs head of financing group in Asia ex-Japan.  “The IPOs in Asia have been very different over the past 18 months,” he added.   A global trend towards higher interest rates has made the equity-linked bonds more popular. Higher rates mean other financing alternatives such as straight bonds tend to be more expensive for companies.  In the latest deal, Chinese video platform Bilibili this week launched a more than $600m convertible bond sale and follow-on share offering combination, one year after listing in the US.  Another factor underpinning record convertible bond issuance is that many Chinese tech groups are still seeking more funds after going public last year but failing to raise their targeted amount. “Some of these companies were not able to raise what they wanted at the time of their IPO. The markets were softer then,” said Saurabh Dinakar, a managing director in Morgan Stanley’s capital markets group. Shanghai-based electric-car maker Nio, for example, priced its IPO towards the low end of its range last year. The company raised $650m in a convertible bond in January, four months after listing.   Tech companies have long favoured convertible bonds. For many of the smaller ones, in particular, raising debt is more difficult because they are losing cash, which means their main avenues of funding are equity and convertible bonds.  Convertibles allow fast-growing tech companies that do not yet have the revenue necessary for issuing debt to tap into a rally for corporate debt in Asia. For their part, investors gain exposure to high-growth companies but with the safety of a bond. “With a convertible, companies are basically issuing shares at a premium at a future date. Compared with straight equity, it is less dilutive,” said Lap Liang, director of Investment Banking & Capital Markets at Credit Suisse.  iQiyi, backed by Baidu, raised $1.1bn in convertible bonds last month to fund growth, one of the largest ever offerings for a US-listed Chinese company.  Even more mature companies are taking part. Lenovo made its debut in Asia’s equity-linked market in January, raising $675m from a convertible bond.","03.04.2019"
"Swiss women go on strike as outrage builds over inequality","Nation has poor record on gender issues such as pay gap in spite of wealth, say critics","Tens of thousands of Swiss women staged a nationwide strike on Friday with a message that one of the world’s richest states is giving half of its population a poor deal. The so-called Frauenstreik draws attention to a patchy record on gender equality in Switzerland, which has lagged behind its EU neighbours in trying to improve women’s rights. Women only gained the vote in 1971 — compared with neighbouring Austria where universal suffrage was granted after the first world war — and until 1985 needed permission from their husbands to work or open a bank account. Paid maternity leave was only put into law in 2005. Switzerland’s first national women’s strike was held in 1991 and was the biggest industrial action in the country’s history, involving 500,000. Veterans of that campaign say too little has changed. Most schools require children to be taken home at lunchtime, the cost of childcare is prohibitive and the gender pay gap one of the worst in the developed world. “A lot of women were quite optimistic that progress was going to come naturally and it was just a matter of time,” said Min Li Marti, a sociologist and social democrat member of Switzerland’s parliament, the federal assembly.  There was a very strong women’s movement in Switzerland at the beginning of the last century . . . Some of the slogans on their flags — we could still use them todaySalome Schaerer “But now a lot of women are realising it’s not just going to happen automatically. You still have to fight for progress. It’s about power. And the people with the power are not just going to give it away.”  Organisation for the strike has been intensifying all week. Last weekend, groups of female climbers lit pyres atop several mountains to signal the beginning of preparations. At midnight in Zurich, fireworks were let off near the Langstrasse, the city’s red light district, to signal the beginning of the strike day. After daybreak, women staged brunches and breakfasts to occupy public spaces across the country — with gatherings in even the most rural of villages in Switzerland’s alpine pastures. “Many people, especially most Swiss, think that because Switzerland is so rich everyone is fine: ‘Here is the best place on earth and everywhere else the situation is worse’,” said Simone Schaerer, a member of the group organising events in Zurich. “Women and men in Switzerland grow up thinking this is the optimum of the optimum and they don’t reflect on just how unequal the situation here actually is until they are really faced with it.”  Switzerland had a strong women’s movement more than a century ago, Ms Schaerer points out, but the political and cultural conservatism in Switzerland is a significant barrier to change. “Some of the slogans on their flags — we could still use them today. Equal pay is the most straightforward one but also child-rearing issues and labour rights — they’re the same problems.” Other members of the Zurich Frauenstreik groups said they had drawn inspiration from protests in Argentina, Spain, the US and Poland in recent months.  According to the International Labour Organization, Swiss gender income inequality is among the developed world’s worst — as high as 20 per cent for professional women. Official government statistics report a narrowing gender pay gap, but these are disputed.  One key group of protesters on Friday will be women from rural farming communities. According to the Swiss Association of Female Farmers and Rural Women, 31,000 women on farms receive little or no social security and pension protection. On average, female farm workers put in 63 hours a week, but only 30 per cent of them are entitled to state social security and pension benefits. Women protesting in Bern as part of a national strike in Switzerland against unequal wages, pressures on part-time workers, the burden of household work and sexual violence  In protests in Zurich nurses, teachers, watchmakers and bankers were all out in force. Many reported employers were lukewarm at best on their attendance, however. Both of the country’s biggest banks, Credit Suisse and UBS, told the FT that staff would have to take leave if they wanted to take part.  The gender pay gap in the Swiss banking sector has worsened in recent years. It is now higher than the national average, at 24 per cent, according to a study published last week by the Swiss Bank Employees’ Union.
 Swiss politicians are mostly in consensus that the country needs to do more to support women. According to the OECD, the government is among the most active in addressing the issue worldwide. Andrea Gmür, a parliamentarian from Lucerne for the centre-right Swiss Christian Democratic Party, the CVP, said: “It should be natural for women to earn as much as men for work of equal value, to be equally treated in social security, for women’s position in the labour market to be improved and for women’s valuable voluntary work, which might be difficult to quantify in monetary terms, to be given greater recognition.”  But many blame Switzerland’s political structure for the slowness of change. The country’s direct democracy is celebrated by many Swiss for its stability and fairness, but the system also gives the country’s lesser-populated, rural, conservative cantons a big say in decision-making.  “The big achievements in women’s history were never achieved through discussing it in parliament,” said Linda Zobrist, an organiser of the protests in Zurich. “They came about through fighting for our rights.” Striking women disrupted traffic and caused minor delays to public transport but for the most part, events across the country were festive and gently provocative. “Town beautification” teams dressed statues of male armour-clad heroes of the Swiss past in pink skirts and tied ribbons around their heads in Schywz. In Uster, two septuagenarian women baked 250 cookies in the shape of the Venus symbol to hand out to male commuters. But interest was far from universal. Parts of Zurich’s well-heeled city medieval centre, and its manicured rows of luxury boutiques, carried on untouched by events, and thronged with the usual crowd of wealthy shoppers winding down for the weekend.","14.06.2019"
"Stocks to watch: MorphoSys, Daimler, BT, Admiral, Bakkavor, RWE","Woodford-backed IP Group needs a cash call and a strategy change, says Jefferies","Monday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● MorphoSys of Germany led the Stoxx 600 gainers after the antibody developer delivered promising headline results of a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of its tafasitamab drug for treating lymphoma. Management was expected to give more detail on the trial, known as L-MIND, at a New York investor meeting scheduled for Tuesday.   The trial, which tested the drug in combination with Celgene’s lenalidomide, showed an improved median overall survival versus previous data and suggested tolerability and safety were at least as good as peer treatments including Roche’s polatuzumab.  Goldman Sachs analysts said they were increasingly comfortable with expectations that the US Food and Drug Administration would approve tafasitamab on the basis of the L-MIND trial alone. It kept a peak sales forecast for the drug of $1bn. ● Daimler was the worst performer among Europe’s auto stocks after a profit warning. The German group said it would book a “high three-digit” million euro provision in the second quarter for diesel-related issues in its vans division, as well as legal costs. For the full year, Daimler guided for earnings before interest and tax “in the magnitude of the previous year”, having previously targeted growth of between 5 and 15 per cent. Daimler’s warning followed press reports over the weekend that Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority had ordered the recall of 60,000 vans because they used so-called emission defeat devices. Sellside stories ● Deutsche Bank downgraded BT Group to “sell” from “hold” with a 175p target.  The broker said it had previously worried about BT’s slow rollout of a fibre network and the less advanced state of convergence in the UK versus other markets, but saw the stock as fairly priced in a cheap European telecoms sector. However, pressure was likely to build over the next few months as alternative fibre-to-the-home providers such as FibreNation and Gigaclear get the backing of Sky and TalkTalk, which have a combined 40 per cent market share of retail broadband, it said. With full-fibre deployment reaching a tipping point within the industry, BT’s Openreach wholesale division will deliver lower revenue with higher capital expenditure than currently expected, Deutsche said. The broker cut its 2022 free cash flow estimate for BT by 12 per cent as well as forecasting a dividend cut from 2021. To avoid continued balance sheet strain, and with lower interest rates suggesting little relief on pensions costs, BT was likely to cut its annual dividend to 10.3p from 2021, Deutsche added. ● Barclays upgraded car insurer Admiral 
to “overweight” from “underweight” with a £23 target price. “Our analysis suggests insurance prices have reached an inflection point in the second quarter 2019, with April-May prices up 4 per cent — a trend that we believe will only be recorded by the wider market when the mainstream quarterly indices are published in the second half of July. We see this turn as a positive for Hastings and Admiral, given their share prices have historically been highly correlated to movements in premiums.”Barclays ● Morgan Stanley upgraded foodmaker Bakkavor to “equal weight” from “underweight”. A 35 per cent drop since flotation in 2017 has priced in “unprecedented” cost inflation and UK trading uncertainty, it said. “A tightening labour market, rapidly rising raw material costs and a weak sterling presented an extremely challenging environment for Bakkavor. As we look ahead to the second half 2019 and 2020, a softer raw material outlook is making us feel less bearish. While the picture hasn’t turned positive for the company, the more predictable risks may be behind us.”Morgan Stanley Brexit remains a risk for Bakkavor given it buys 37 per cent of its raw materials from the continental European Union and EU nationals account for about 50 per cent of its workforce, Morgan Stanley said. The broker also forecast that Bakkavor’s 2019 free cash flow would be insufficient to cover dividends, squeezing net debt to 2.1 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation. However, capital expenditure cuts should help bolster cash in the short term, it said. ● Jefferies cut its target price on IP Group, the Woodford Investment Management-backed technology incubator, to 65p from 79p and repeated “underperform” advice.  Investing at recent rates, IP Group will require more funding in 2020 but the current discount to net asset value suggests significant dilution from any cash call, Jefferies said. It estimated a value on IP’s portfolio of 109p a share, down 5.5 per cent since the 2018 year end and 14 per cent below 2015 peak levels. Oxford Nanopore, the DNA sequencing equipment developer, dwarfs all of IP’s other investments, accounting for 24 per cent of the portfolio, said Jefferies. But with the “premature” flotation of Oxford Nanopore seeming to be off the agenda, cash is dwindling and realisations both in IP’s listed and unlisted portfolios are likely to be difficult, said the broker. It questioned whether IP should switch strategy towards cutting costs and close itself off to new investments, similar to the actions taken by peers Allied Minds and Malin. ● In brief: Aventron cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Boliden upgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Delivery Hero rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Entertainment One rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Julius Baer upgraded to “outperform” at RBC; Kemira cut to “hold” at Danske Bank; Nanoco downgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Natixis cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Melrose rated new “buy” at Citigroup; Partners Group raised to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; RWE cut to “reduce” at HSBC; Recipharm rated new “hold” at Jefferies; Recordati rated new “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; SLM Solutions cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Takeaway raised to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Tod’s downgraded to “underperform” at Credit Suisse.

"Stocks to watch: Thyssenkrupp, Petrofac, Jupiter, Brenntag, Micron","Adidas looks too cheap at a 20% discount to Nike, says Berenberg","Wednesday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Thyssenkrupp led the Stoxx 600 gainers after Platow Brief, the German language financial magazine, reported that Kone was preparing a bid for the steelmaker’s elevator business and has obtained commitments from financing partners. Thyssen said in May that it had scrapped plans to break up and would instead float the highly valued elevator division.  “A sale of Thyssenkrupp’s elevator technology division looks increasingly likely to us . . . There is simply too much strategic value in elevator consolidation for management’s announced single-track IPO plan to be rational.”Barclays ● John Wood gained on the back of a reassuring trading update. The oil services engineer said revenue held steady in the first half and left expectations unchanged for 5 per cent growth by the full year. The other main positive was net debt, said analysts, which was little changed from the full year 2018 at $1.6bn. Slow progress with disposals and fears of a dividend cut meant Wood underperformed peers by 30 per cent in the past six months, so was due a relief rally, analysts said. “Ultimately consistent strong free cash flow generation is what will re-rate the stock. However, this in our view is more a 2020 event (assuming we do get the expected ramp down in exceptional costs and ongoing earnings growth),” said Credit Suisse. ● Petrofac surged on reports that the Serious Fraud Office had dropped a criminal investigation into three businessmen who had been accused of conspiring to make corrupt payments to secure contracts in Iraq. The SFO launched an investigation into Petrofac in May 2017 as part of a wider probe into Unaoil, a Monaco-based oil consultancy. ● Brenntag of Germany slipped after Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the company sold weapons-grade chemicals to a Syrian pharmaceutical group with links to president Bashar Hafez al-Assad’s regime. Prosecutors in Germany and Belgium were looking into the case and considering whether to open a formal investigation, according to broadcaster Deutsche Welle. In response, Brenntag said a Swiss subsidiary had made the deliveries in 2014 “in accordance with applicable law” and that the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) “confirmed compliance with the export procedures”. Last year SECO again “comprehensively examined the case and found no misconduct”, it said. ● RPS hit a 20-year low after the environmental consultancy said full-year results would be materially worse than expectations due largely to problems in Australia, which provides nearly a quarter of group net fee income. A slowdown in economic growth had stalled Australia’s property sector, the recent state elections in Victoria and New South Wales meant a pause in infrastructure spending, and defence projects have been slow to come through after a change of government earlier this year, RPS said.  In response, Liberum cut its profit estimate for RPS’s Asia-Pacific business by 64 per cent to £6m. Smaller downgrades across the group’s other divisions led it to cut a penny off first-half earnings per share, which fell to 5.5p.  ● Micron Technology led the semiconductor stocks higher after its third quarter proved better than expected. The memory chipmaker said revenue last quarter fell 39 per cent year on year but flagged that shipment growth should improve in the second half as customers run down inventories. Micron also said it was able to ship some products to Huawei of China over the past two weeks, in spite of the US export ban. For the fiscal fourth-quarter Micron said to expect revenue in the range of $4.5bn and EPS of around $0.45, which was below the analyst consensus. Nevertheless, the guidance “was better than feared as some investors believed the company would lose money”, said Needham, which upgraded Micron to “buy”. The improving outlook, a stabilising book value and big capital expenditure cuts to come next year suggest “there’s limited downside risk over the next six to 12 months”, it said. Sellside stories ● Berenberg upgraded Adidas to “buy” from “hold” with a €315 target price.  “Adidas is dominantly positioned in the attractive sportswear space. Brand momentum has softened, but this is captured in valuation. We foresee an inflection point in momentum as supply constraints fade and product tailwinds build. The direct-to-consumer channel is driving structurally higher profitability and accelerating market share gains. Against overly conservative consensus forecasts, and with the stock now trading at a 20 per cent discount to Nike, now is the time to buy.”Berenberg ● Peel Hunt upgraded Jupiter Fund Management to “buy” from “hold” with a 480p target price.  Fund factsheets to the end of May suggest fund flows have stabilised in recent months, having suffered material outflows in 2018, Peel Hunt said. It also said that, while individual fund performance remained patchy, the shares were “not particularly expensive” at an enterprise valuation of 10 times 2019 earnings and a 5.7 per cent dividend yield. “It might be slightly early in calling the turn in flows but the balance of risk has definitely shifted to the upside,” it said.

"Stocks to watch: Greggs, HSBC, Weight Watchers, Pandora, Nestlé","Ryanair’s breadth of network reduces Brexit risks, says SocGen","Tuesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● Greggs hit a record high after reporting “exceptional” trading momentum in the year to date, with like-for-like sales up 9.6 per cent in managed shops. The bakery chain said that 2019 underlying profit would be ahead of market expectations thanks largely to “extensive publicity” around its launch of a vegan sausage roll. “The difficult question to answer is where trading levels settle to once the curiosity has died down,” said Canaccord Genuity. It said that at an enterprise value of more than 23 times Greggs’ 2018 operating profit, “the market is entering new territory for valuing this stock. We think this is deserved as the operational performance is improving as well as the trading momentum.” ● HSBC led the FTSE 100 fallers after its fourth-quarter profit missed expectations by a wide margin. The bank posted underlying earnings of $3.39bn, 24 per cent below consensus as revenues, costs and loan impairments all disappointed. Net interest margins (NIM) also weakened during the year in spite of higher interest rates, which led analysts to cut 2019 forecasts to reflect growing pressure on the so-called “jaws ratio” between income growth and expenses. “We came away from the HSBC analyst and earnings call more cautious on the 2019 outlook. The expanding NIM story that helped support the HSBC investment story is now in reverse — and further headwinds on NIM are emerging. Positive ‘jaws’ was missed in 2018 and given the NII [net interest income] headwind will be tough to achieve in 2019 without damaging the franchise which requires ongoing technological and geographic investments.”Citigroup ● Cobham rallied after agreeing to settle a long-running dispute with Boeing over its KC-46 refuelling tanker programme, which had seen the US group withhold payments and claim unquantified damages. The aerospace engineer said it would take a £160m exceptional charge, £86m of which was to cover damages to Boeing. Jefferies said that even though the cost was £100m more than it expected, the news was still “a significant step forward” in rehabilitating Cobham. “Ultimately, we believe it is on issues like improving working capital and signs of operational gearing . . .  that future share price performance hinges. Declaration of a final dividend for the full year 2018 would also send a positive signal. Exactly what the share price does next may even depend on the tone struck by management at the full-year results on March 7; we sense it should be more positive, but are not sure we’d put our shirts on it.”Jefferies Sellside stories ● Société Générale upgraded Ryanair to “buy” with a €14 target price. “Last year was a difficult one for airline stocks. High capacity, air traffic control issues and rising oil prices turned out to be a toxic mix. The outlook for 2019 is better: oil prices have come down and capacity growth probably won’t be excessive (although still high). The stock market seems to be in rebound mood.”SocGen SocGen’s house view was for a mild US recession in 2020 and a marked slowdown of global GDP, which it said favoured “investments with a long-term track record, proven crisis resistance and/or limited Brexit risk”. Ryanair and Lufthansa
 fit the criteria as they operate broad, diversified networks and have outperformed most peers in past crises, said the broker.  As part of the same research, SocGen upgraded Air France-KLM to “hold” based on “some early signs of restructuring success under the new chief executive, but still with significant remaining execution risk”. EasyJet and IAG were retained on “hold” recommendations to reflect Brexit risks, while Wizz Air was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” on valuation grounds.  ● JPMorgan downgraded Weight Watchers International to “underweight” from “neutral” with a $25 target price. It cited evidence that daily active users have continued to drop “in the most important period of the year”. Checks based on website traffic suggest Weight Watchers’ daily average user count has fallen 35 per cent year on year in the quarter to date and app “reviews have become increasingly negative since [autumn] 2018, with users complaining of significant technical issues”, JPMorgan said. Its data also pointed to competitors Noom and Diet Doctor increasing their share of traffic. Given that about 23 per cent of Weight Watchers’ shares are loaned to short sellers, “we believe investors are likely, at least partially, [to be] pricing in negative user data”, said JPMorgan. “However, we believe the gross margin drag implications are still under-appreciated as Weight Watchers’ cost of goods and services are primarily fixed in nature.”  It forecast the company to deliver earnings per share this year of $2.50, compared with a market consensus of $3.49, and argued that there was limited visibility on when management would revive sales. The broker assumed a turnround by 2020 but cautioned that during a 2013 downturn Weight Watchers reported three consecutive years of revenue declines. ● In brief: ALD raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Airbus upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Ashtead rated new “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Asiamet Resources rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Austrian Post cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Balta downgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Cargotec raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; DSM downgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Dotdigital rated new “buy” at Canaccord; Kloeckner raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Lundin Petroleum upgraded to “outperform” at RBC; Nestlé cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Oscar Properties cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Pandora cut to “sell” at SEB; Phoenix rated new “buy” at Panmure Gordon; Rational downgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Temenos rated new “buy” at HSBC; Worldline cut to “neutral” at Citigroup.

"EU accuses eight banks of collusion in sovereign bond market","Brussels charges traders with coordinating strategies on euro-denominated paper","Brussels has accused eight unnamed banks of colluding to game the €7tn market for eurozone government bonds, marking another escalation in the EU’s drive to punish financial institutions for rigging financial markets. EU antitrust authorities have sent a formal charge sheet alleging that traders employed by the eight lenders exchanged information and co-ordinated trading strategies for euro-denominated bonds intermittently between 2007 and 2012. The price rigging was not bank-wide but involved specific traders at various lenders who in some cases moved between institutions during the period, they said. Over time the alleged collusion involved roughly a third of the banks in the primary eurobond market.  The traders mainly used online chat rooms when they “exchanged commercially sensitive information and co-ordinated on trading strategies” to engage in “a collusive scheme that aimed at distorting competition”, the EU authorities said. Thursday’s announcement is part of a campaign by European competition enforcers to uncover rigging of financial benchmarks by traders.  EU antitrust officials unveiled a separate investigation in December that accused Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Crédit Agricole and one other unnamed bank of price rigging in the market for some types of US dollar-denominated government bonds. There is also a probe under way into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates by eight banks — UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Barclays, HSBC and two others. The parties were nearing a settlement in the autumn of 2017, but the investigation is continuing as at least one bank has decided not to settle, according to two people familiar with the matter. Simon Hart, head of financial disputes at law firm RPC, said: “Investment banks may have hoped they had put allegations of market manipulation behind them after Libor and FX, but a new front appears to be opening up.” Since 2013, Brussels has also fined seven banks €1.3bn for manipulating euro benchmark derivatives, six banks were fined €670m for rigging yen interest rate derivatives and three banks were fined €32m for colluding on the Swiss Franc instrument. But the EU’s financial market probes do not always result in fines. In 2015, the EU dropped a four-year investigation into suspected anti-competitive behaviour in the credit default swaps market that involved more than a dozen banks. There are no time limits on the latest investigation and the European Commission’s powerful competition department has the power to fine companies up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover for breaching antitrust rules, which could amount to billions of euros if the largest investment banks are involved. Under EU rules, the banks have the right to examine the commission’s evidence, present comments and also request a hearing on the case before Brussels takes a final decision. The banks can provide information or seek to agree a settlement in exchange for reduced fines, as Deutsche Bank is doing in the case related to US sovereign bonds. There is more than €7tn in euro-denominated government debt outstanding, according to Greenwich Associates, which describes it as “closer in scope and structure to the US municipal bond market” than to the US Treasury market. As each member state issues its own bonds and has a separate credit rating, the market is more fragmented than the $15tn market for US Treasuries.","31.01.2019"
"Opening Quote: Private equity readies to raise billions for deals","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email. Brace yourselves. Europe's biggest private equity groups are rushing to raise new mega funds before a turn in the market, our private equity correspondent reports exclusively this morning.  CVC Capital Partners, which recently acquired a 27 per cent stake in the commercial arm of Premiership Rugby, the top tier of English club rugby, is attempting to raise what would be Europe’s largest ever fund — potentially more than €18bn — as early as next year. Stockholm-based EQT, which is considering a listing later this year, is set to raise a record flagship fund at around €14bn in 2020. And London-based BC Partners is expected to raise a new fund within the next 12 months.  It's not like the firms are short of cash. Funds are getting bigger. CVC has had to amend terms to remove a clause that forced it to have at least 70 per cent of its previous fund invested before raising a new one so that it can get to market with its new fundraising sooner. But the money is there, and PE houses want to grab it before investors get cold feet, or a downturn spooks them.  The question is what having all that extra money competing for assets means for valuations — and returns. Is this 2006 all over again? Hold on tight.  Briefly Old Mutual has sacked its chief executive Peter Moyo after suspending him last month. His suspension came in the wake of a ""material breakdown of trust and confidence"" with the board over a conflict of interest involving a private equity company he founded. Old Mutual wanted to know about dividends paid by the private equity group to Mr Moyo which it said were in breach of its rights as a preference shareholder. The financial services group said it had now given notice to terminate Mr Moyo's contract after failed attempts to engage on the ""terms of separation"". A process to appoint a new chief executive has started; chief operating officer Iain Williamson remains interim CEO in the meantime.  Also reporting today is FTSE 100 equipment rental group Ashtead. It posted a 17 per cent increase in revenues and a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in its full-year results, buoyed by ""strong end markets in North America"".  Heathrow has laid out its masterplan for expansion as a 12-week consultation on its third runway kicks off. The airport said expansion was not ""at any cost"" as it set out the detailed proposals for the new runway and other infrastructure such as terminals and access roads. The latest consultation forms part of Heathrow's application for a development consent order, which ultimately has to be approved by the transport secretary — something not expected until 2021. The UK competition watchdog is to get “judge and jury” powers to impose fines on companies that overcharge or mislead customers under plans announced by Theresa May. The Competition and Markets Authority will be able to hit companies with fines for poor behaviour without having to go to court, as the outgoing prime minister seeks to deliver on a pledge to stop consumer rip-offs.

 Job moves  The UK Serious Fraud Office has added Emir Feisal and Martin Spencer to its board as non-executive directors. Mr Feisal spent most of his career as Associate Managing Editor at the Sunday Times, but also sits on boards including at St Georges Hospital and the Council of the Inns of Court. Mr Spencer has a background in technology consulting and business transformation (which hints at the work the SFO has ahead of it…)  We're looking to feature more job moves.

 Beyond the Square Mile   Sotheby’s has gone under the hammer for $3.7bn, ending three decades of public ownership, after the venerable auction house was sold to Patrick Drahi, the billionaire founder of telecoms group Altice. The new owner has an art collection of his own that includes works by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. The deal is a vindication for Dan Loeb, the activist hedge fund manager whose group Third Point has owned shares in the auction house since 2013, says our M&A newsletter Due Diligence.  Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, which owns stakes in Barclays, Credit Suisse and Porsche, is ramping up its investment plans in North America and Asia, and creating a unit to scour for opportunities in emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and Asia in an effort to snap up stakes in companies directly. KPMG has agreed to pay $50m to settle claims that it went back to alter audits it had already completed. The SEC also found that numerous KPMG audit professionals had cheated on internal training exams by sharing answers and manipulating test results.

"US drugs pricing: jagged little pill","Reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs would lessen public anger towards Big Pharma","Nothing beats pricing power as a measure of a good business. Warren Buffett’s dictum suggests the drugs industry is unwell. In recent days, pharmaceuticals companies such as Novartis, Pfizer and Allergan have all warned investors about their inability to charge more for their drugs. Pricing is not going to be a growth driver now, or in the future, said Pfizer’s boss Albert Bourla.  If true, it would be a dramatic change. US price rises accounted for 80 per cent of the industry’s earnings growth in 2017, says Credit Suisse. Those days are gone, President Donald Trump boasted in the State of the Union address. He said that last year prices fell by the most for 46 years. He promised more to come, including a swipe at “global freeloading”. The drugs industry hates talk of pegging prices to those paid abroad. Scepticism is justified. The measure cited by President Trump, which showed a 0.6 per cent fall in 2018, is flawed. The drugs companies announced large price increases last month. And despite the political rhetoric about price gouging in the US, which accounts for the lion’s share of industry profits, shares have out-performed. Over the past two years, the MSCI US healthcare index has risen 26 per cent, a third more than the S&P 500. A mooted crackdown could actually help the industry. The administration has proposed outlawing the billions of dollars in annual rebates that drugmakers give middlemen known as pharmacy-benefit managers. It would redirect those discounts toward patients. Amid heavy lobbying, there is no certainty the rule will be adopted.  If it goes ahead, it might be good news for the industry. Novartis boss Vas Narasimhan said it would correct a distortion. His company channels almost half its gross revenues into rebates. Reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs would lessen public anger towards Big Pharma. Cutting out the middlemen might allow them to raise net prices unobtrusively. The shake-up could even leave drugs companies better off.  Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers. Wednesday: Lex Letter From London, New York or San Francisco.

"A deep dive into Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One scoop to start: UK supermarket chains Sainsbury’s and Asda are set to concede defeat over a £7bn tie-up, reports the FT’s Jonathan Eley. 
   
  Tom Barrack was barely in his forties when his boss, the oil heir Robert Bass, entrusted him with the assignment that would launch him on the path to power and fortune. Almost by accident, the Texan billionaire had become the owner of an 80-year-old hotel at the south-east corner of Central Park. The Plaza occupied an even more prestigious stretch of the ego-driven imaginations of New York’s tycoon class, and Barrack, whose job was to sell it, managed to fetch $400m — more than anyone had previously paid for a single hotel. The buyer was Donald Trump, who soon had cause to rue the deal. It was the “first time in my life I have knowingly made a deal which was not economic”, Trump conceded, even in the optimistic days before his creditors seized a 49 per cent stake. “I can never justify the price I paid, no matter how successful the Plaza becomes.” Barrack’s enduring friendship with the 45th president is one of the striking features of his career.  In the decades that followed the Plaza sale, the two men frequently announced deals together, although in the end many of them came to nought. Most recently, Barrack’s Colony Capital was slated to provide financing for the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC; in the end, Deutsche Bank provided the money instead. Since Trump turned to politics, Barrack has supported him with public praise and energetic fundraising. Colony even provided office space for a December 2016 meeting between an associate of Vladimir Putin and Jared Kushner, the future US president’s son-in-law, according to the report by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But despite an investment career that set Barrack on a path to influence and fortune, some believe he’s been a poor steward of other people’s capital, according to this deep dive by DD’s Mark Vandevelde.  Data seen by the Financial Times indicate a performance record for Colony funds which has been, at best, mixed.   Nobody puts Occidental in the corner Occidental Petroleum is done playing nice. The US oil and gas company has launched a hostile $55bn bid for Anadarko Petroleum in the hopes of thwarting its planned acquisition by Chevron. The Houston-based company has made a cash-and-shares offer worth $76 per Anadarko share, a premium of roughly 22 per cent over the value of the bid from Chevron. Why the hostility? Anadarko has already rejected two offers from Occidental made earlier this month on the grounds that there was too great a chance that the deal couldn’t be completed. The board opted for Chevron’s lower bid instead and spurned Occidental’s attempts to talk. Occidental was not happy about being ghosted. In a letter to Anadarko’s board, chief executive Vicki Hollub wrote it was “unfortunate” that they had agreed to pay a $1bn break fee in the Chevron deal “without even picking up the phone to speak to us after we made two proposals during the week of April 8”.   
  Both Chevron and Occidental are after Anadarko’s prized assets in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the US shale oil boom. Wednesday’s offer raises the prospect of a bidding war for Anadarko but it’s unlikely that Chevron will up its offer as its board is uncomfortable with taking on further risk, two people close to the company told the FT. As everyone knows, three’s a crowd and in this ménages a trois the market seems to be team Chevron. Occidental’s shares declined 4 per cent to $59.81 soon after the market opened and Paul Sankey, an analyst at Mizuho, wrote in a note: “We think the bid is a very bad idea. So does pretty much absolutely everyone we talk to.” You can read the full piece here and Lex’s analysis here. AstraZeneca boss reflects on five years since Pfizer’s takeover bid Five years ago, Pascal Soriot was preparing for battle with one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The Frenchman, who learned to hold his own growing up in the Parisian banlieues, was resisting an attempt by US drugmaker Pfizer to take over AstraZeneca 18 months into his tenure as head of the Anglo-Swedish drugs company.   
  Soriot was on shaky ground, fending off advances from the transatlantic predator while standing close to a vertiginous patent cliff. He made promises to AstraZeneca’s board that he could breathe new life into the company’s research and development operations to cushion the fall. The aim was for “strong and consistent revenue growth” from a new pipeline of drugs. Since then, the company’s share price was always going to be measured against the £55 offered by Pfizer in 2014. “We kept having to answer that question ‘where is my 55?’ for two or three years,” Soriot told the FT’s Sarah Neville. Last autumn, AstraZeneca’s stock price finally surpassed the offer made by Pfizer, a long-awaited moment of vindication for Soriot. Perhaps too long. Some shareholders weren’t happy about having to wait five years for the company to reach a similar share price to Pfizer’s offer.   
  “I could have taken [£55] five years ago and reinvested it back into the market and the market has gone up by 10 to 15 per cent . . . the jury is out on was it the right thing to do to turn it down,” Joe Walters, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which is a top-20 shareholder, told the FT. However, criticism is tempered by the fact that Soriot has executed an impressive overhaul of AstraZeneca’s R&D operation. Michael Leuchten, a research analyst at UBS, credited Soriot with “giving the organisation its R&D mojo back”. It’s a fair statement — the majority of growth between now and 2023 will come from drugs that have been launched in the past three years. Walters conceded that the impact of patent expiries is expected to diminish after 2019, saying “we are at the bottom of the valley and you can see the sunny uplands at the top”. At peace with his decision to turn down Pfizer’s offer, Soriot is now focused on the future. Wirecard latest For those closely following the FT investigation into Wirecard, there were some significant developments on Wednesday.   
  First, Japan’s SoftBank agreed to invest €900m in Wirecard, the German digital payments company battling an accounting scandal. SoftBank, a technology conglomerate that has become one of the sector’s biggest and most high-profile investors, will buy five-year Wirecard bonds that can convert into an equity stake in the German company. Details here. Later in the day, the FT’s Dan McCrum reported that half of the worldwide revenue and almost all of the reported profits of Wirecard have come from only three opaque partner companies in recent years, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.   Archives: Read the FT’s full coverage of Wirecard here.

"Stocks to watch: Merlin, Wirecard, Evraz, Burberry, Thomas Cook","Aston Martin’s £2.4m supercar can turn its fortunes around, says Bernstein","Monday 15.00 BST Sellside stories ● Bernstein Research upgraded Aston Martin-Lagonda to “outperform” from “neutral” with an unchanged £12 target price.  When starting coverage of Aston in January, Bernstein told clients to “wait until after the profit warning”. Aston “simply wasn’t worth” the £19 price set at flotation in October and unless production, pricing and consistency improves dramatically it probably never will be, said Bernstein.  However, while a warning remains possible, the risk has diminished thanks to Aston’s decision to moderate production in response to a lukewarm reception for its DB11 and Vantage models, it said. The tighter supply has resulted in accelerating retail sales as models sell out. So assuming Aston can get through 2019 largely unscathed, the launch next year of the DBX sport utility vehicle has the potential to transform the company’s financials and the hype around the £2.4m Valkyrie supercar can resurrect the brand, Bernstein argued. That makes Aston’s valuation of 21 times 2021 earnings “still expensive, but no longer insane”, it said. “We may need to put our tin hats and flak jacket [on] to get through the next 12 months. There’s lots that could go wrong — and having an outperform rating on a fragile company may prove quite stressful. The reality is that huge risks remain at Aston. It could still fall short of its volume plan this year, if Vantage’s improved momentum fails to prove sustainable. Valkyrie (which we model as profitable in 2020) could be late. DBX could easily be late to launch (due to factors beyond management’s control — that’s just the way it goes sometimes). US tariffs could cripple the company, given its current financial weakness. If Jeremy Corbyn is the next UK prime minister, Aston sales in the UK (currently 22 per cent of total) will go to approximately zero. In a company with such a fragile balance sheet, the consequences could be ugly. But 2020 could show a dramatic acceleration in Aston’s revenues and 2021 could be significantly profitable.”Bernstein ● HSBC downgraded Merlin Entertainments to “reduce” from “buy” on valuation grounds. It said that the Alton Towers and Legoland owner did not deserve its premium to UK-listed peers such as Carnival or Cineworld, which have a more compelling growth story and deliver similar returns. An “OK” short- and medium-term outlook should allow Merlin to deliver like-for-like revenue growth, which will offset cost pressures and keep earnings steady, HSBC said. However, it saw returns on invested capital as “not especially compelling” against a valuation of 18.6 times earnings, particularly as new developments would take longer to mature than older ones. The newer sites, while potentially more profitable, also involved reduced transparency, it said. “Return on invested capital could rise over time as the business model evolves to become more asset light, but the downside is that this could be at the expense of growth: A new Legoland development on a management contract could only add circa 1-2 per cent to group profits versus the more chunky increments when the group puts its own capital at risk.”HSBC Unless Merlin embarks on acquisitions or can find a new format to roll out aggressively, it may turn from a growth stock to one that returns excess cash to shareholders, HSBC said. “This is not a bad thing but, again, the group is priced for more.” ● Deutsche Bank upgraded Wirecard, the German electronic payments processor, to “buy” from “hold” with a €200 target.  “Wirecard is performing well in a competitive payments industry, successfully expanding its footprint to larger clients while increasingly penetrating its existing merchant/financial institution customer base with value-added services. This should provide further growth and increase the stickiness of its offering . . . This should support earnings growth for Wirecard in the mid-30 per cent area over 2018-21, in line with fast-growing global payments peers, while its shares trade on a 35-40 per cent discount to the sector.”Deutsche Bank On the FT investigation into Wirecard, Deutsche noted that a detailed result of the company’s internal report into suspicious transactions was not made available to the public and authorities in Singapore continue to investigate the allegations. However, “based on Wirecard’s summary of the law firm’s report and the fact that [auditor EY] has signed the 2018 annual report with an unqualified audit opinion — and assuming that the law and accounting firms have had the appropriate access to documents and systems — we think it is reasonable to believe that financials as presented by Wirecard are appropriately stated, for the purpose of forming our investment view . . . If this assumption is misplaced, and Wirecard’s financials are materially restated in the future, the reputational damage to its business could be severe and its share price could again fall sharply.” ● Investec downgraded Metro Bank to “sell” from “hold” with a 620p target price. The cut came in response to Metro’s £375m share issue last week. “To be clear, Metro Bank is well capitalised, has an exemplary credit history, is moderately profitable and is extremely liquid. As such, we saw last week’s destructive rumour-mill as baseless; there should be no ‘customer issues’ whatsoever . . . For us, the key problem is Metro’s moderate levels of profitability and return, and the dampening effect of a slower pace of planned growth.”Investec Slow growth means Metro is unlikely to reach management’s target of low double-digit return on equity by 2023, said Investec. On that basis, a valuation of 0.8 times tangible net asset value over the next four years “now appears a little too rich”, it said. ● Citigroup reiterated a “sell” rating and 0p price target on Thomas Cook, having sounded out investors last week on its view that the tour operator needed a debt-for-equity swap that would wipe out shareholders.  “There was a tight consensus of opinion on the need for a substantial debt-for-equity swap to provide the group with a sound footing for the future. The vast majority of investors agreed with our opinion that such a process would allow the company to continue to trade in the long term but there was likely to be little or no value for the existing equity holders — an important distinction.”Citi Investors have a good understanding of Thomas Cook’s working capital cycle and many believed the company should have no permanent debt, said Citi. “With this in mind, investors think that the group should seek to convert the £1bn of outstanding bonds to equity.” Such a move would save Thomas Cook at least £55m in annual interest, boosting profit after tax to more than £60m from £22m in the current financial year, it forecast. Peer valuations of between 6 and 16 times earnings indicated an equity value to bondholders of £400m to £1bn, or between 40 and 100 per cent of face value, it said. ● In brief: 1&1 Drillisch raised to “neutral” at Citigroup; Adevinta rated new “overweight” at Barclays and JPMorgan; BPER Banca cut to “hold” at HSBC; Bouygues upgraded to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Boohoo cut to “hold” at Shore Capital; Burberry raised to “neutral” at Bryan Garnier; Codemasters rated new “buy” at Shore Capital; Commerzbank cut to “neutral” at UBS; Crédit Agricole cut to “neutral” at UBS; Deutsche Bank cut to “sell” at UBS; EFG International cut to “sell” at UBS; Evraz upgraded to “buy” at VTB Capital; Frontier Developments rated new “buy” at Shore Capital; Hays raised to “outperform” at RBC; HeidelbergCement cut to “sell” at Société Générale; Ipsen raised to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Julius Baer cut to “neutral” at UBS; Land Securities cut to “hold” at Liberum; Maersk Drilling raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Natixis downgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Next upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Sumo rated new “hold” at Shore Capital; Synthomer rated new “buy” at Stifel; Victrex rated new “buy” at Stifel.

"UBS suffers ‘one of the worst’ starts to year in investment banking","Chief executive Sergio Ermotti imposes cost-saving plans after revenues slump","UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti said its investment banking business has had one of its worst starts to the year in recent history, with trading, mergers and capital markets activity all grinding to a halt outside the US. Revenues at the division in the first quarter were down about a third compared with the same period last year, Mr Ermotti said in a conference speech on Wednesday. At the Swiss bank’s core wealth management business, they have fallen 9 per cent. However, the bank was on track to generate positive net new money in the first three months of the year, he added. “Volatility and volumes are muted and it is clear investors have not yet regained confidence, which took a serious hit in the fourth quarter,” Mr Ermotti said. “Persistent uncertainty and political risks reinforce a ‘wait and see’ approach among our clients.” “While clearly not in line with our long-term aspirations, I find it to be an acceptable outcome, if it is a one-off in one of the worst first-quarter environments in recent history,” he said.  UBS shares fell 2.6 per cent after the comments. European rivals such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank also fell. Mr Ermotti said that, in response to market conditions, he had put the bank in “fuel-saving mode”, attempting to save $300m in costs — about 5 per cent of total expenses — by slowing hiring and postponing IT projects. However, “we will not halt our investments into growth-oriented initiatives to improve short-term profit and loss,” he said, without providing details. UBS had already warned in its annual report last week that there had been little improvement in investor sentiment this year after a brutal end to 2018, when wealth and asset management clients withdrew $13bn amid global market turmoil and the investment bank swung to a $47m loss. “Our starting point for the year is different than we had planned, making this year’s journey toward our targets steeper,” Mr Ermotti said on March 15. Analysts noted the lack of commentary about a proposed $1bn share buyback program this year, warning that executives may decide to reduce or cancel it to conserve cash. Another blow landed last month when a French court imposed a €4.5bn penalty on the bank for helping rich clients evade tax, forcing UBS to increase its provisions for the scandal to $516m as it goes through a lengthy appeals process. “Many of you have asked how recent developments may affect capital returns,” Mr Ermotti said, referring to the French case. The “size and pace of future share buybacks” were an “open question,” he said, and the bank would update investors alongside its results next month. UBS was one of the first major European banks to restructure its business away from investment banking to focus on the more steady and profitable wealth management business after the financial crisis.  While this move established it among the top ranks of its peers for profitability and market valuation, UBS shares fell 32 per cent last year even though net profit rose 16 per cent, as investors started to doubt whether it could continue its growth.","20.03.2019"
"Why investors in India are still spooked by the shadows","Non-bank funding crunch has significant consequences for the world’s sixth-largest economy","When Harshil Mehta took the helm of Dewan Housing Finance in January 2015, he seemed to have landed in the right place at the right time. With India’s dominant state-owned banks creaking under a growing pile of bad debt, corporate and retail borrowers were crying out for credit from the shadow banking system, which is full of non-bank financial companies like Dewan. To fund their rapid lending growth, the so-called NBFCs could turn to the increasingly fruitful short-term credit market, fuelled by debt-focused mutual funds enjoying strong inflows. Between then and last August, Mr Mehta presided over a 170 per cent rise in Dewan’s share price, while the company’s assets more than doubled to over Rs1tn ($14bn). But last week he resigned from a company in crisis, which lost four-fifths of its market value in just five months. In doing so, he became the most prominent casualty of a darkening of sentiment across India’s short-term debt market, which has harmed the prospects of the NBFCs who relied on it. The debt market squeeze began in September, after IL&FS — a large infrastructure and finance group which had borrowed heavily in the debt market — began defaulting on debt, despite enjoying a triple-A score from local rating agencies.  Four months on, NBFCs like Dewan are still struggling to raise funding, with Indian money-market funds showing a far more cautious stance after a rash of redemptions by nervous retail investors. Market participants warn that the growth momentum of India’s still small corporate debt market has been checked — with significant consequences for the wider economy, the world’s sixth largest, which had relied heavily on NBFCs to support credit growth in recent years. “For many of these NBFCs, the debt markets are frozen,” says Ashish Gupta, head of India research for Credit Suisse. “The second wave of risk aversion is very much visible now.” Dewan’s share price — already down 63 per cent in the last four months of 2018 — has shed a further 45 per cent so far this year. One factor was a January report by investigative website Cobrapost alleging that Dewan’s controlling shareholders had diverted funds to shell companies — something strongly denied by the company. The broader concerns about Dewan relate to its extensive lending to real estate developers — a sector that has been hit by tight new regulations, and by the fallout from the government’s disruptive banknote “demonetisation” in 2016. Particular scrutiny has fallen on the companies behind aggressive property development in Mumbai, where the number of unsold homes rose 9 per cent year-on-year in the second half of 2018, according to estate agency Knight Frank. Average prices, meanwhile, dropped 7 per cent. Loans to real estate developers account for less than a tenth of total NBFC assets, but they are heavily concentrated in a few lenders including Dewan and Indiabulls Housing Finance, whose share price has halved since August. Many developers borrowed aggressively to create large projects in India’s major cities, notes Anuj Puri, founder of property consultancy Anarock, and now face a self-reinforcing spiral of financial stress, as skittish home buyers steer clear. Homebuyers “have become very discerning — they’re not willing to buy an under-construction property from a brand perceived as weak,” Mr Puri says.  The pain for housing developers and their NBFC backers has been intensified by a similarly discerning attitude from debt mutual fund managers, who have been contending with a stream of outflows. At the end of January, assets under management for Indian money market funds were $13.2bn, or 16 per cent lower than five months before. “The choice among investors has narrowed to a few good quality companies — whereas others are not getting rollovers and are having to downsize their balance sheets,” says Mahendra Jajoo, chief investment officer for India at Mirae Asset Global Investors. Even NBFCs with limited exposure to housing developers are feeling the squeeze and have sharply cut back their growth plans, says Prabodh Agarwal, chief financial officer of IIFL Holdings, one of the sector’s larger companies. “NBFCs are still having to fight for liquidity,” he says. “We can live with that, but it means the entire sector’s rate of growth will have to slow down.” That slowdown could have a significant impact on the wider economy, which had grown to rely on NBFCs to help drive credit growth as banks pulled back to deal with their problem loans. In the financial year ending March 2018, NBFCs accounted for 41 per cent of credit growth in India, according to analysts at Nomura. The squeeze is also creating serious discomfort for some of India’s most prominent tycoons. Anil Ambani, once ranked among the world’s richest people, has been struggling to roll over debt extended to his investment vehicles, which includes a significant portion issued to debt mutual funds. This month shares in the billionaire’s power and infrastructure companies fell by more than 50 per cent after lenders began selling shares that he had pledged as collateral. Such episodes reflect the jitters still affecting investors concerned about thinner liquidity, says Gaurav Narain, head of equities for London-listed India Capital Growth Fund. “There’s so much fickleness in the market today that nobody wants to be caught off guard,” he said. “We’re not over this.”","22.02.2019"
"Glencore’s new guard puts accent on managing, not trading, assets","The exit of the head of oil underlines how mining, not trading, has become the core business","The departure of Glencore’s top oil executive is not simply about a generational shift, but points to a bigger transformation at the company from swashbuckling trader to more prosaic miner. Alex Beard’s retirement later this month comes as the company struggles to extract itself from a US regulatory probe. His exit adds to a string of recent departures from the upper echelons of Glencore, including its copper kingpin Telis Mistakidis, Stuart Cutler, the head of ferroalloys trading and Chris Mahoney, the former Olympic rower who ran its agricultural business. Only four of the senior executives who oversaw Glencore’s $60bn blockbuster initial public offering in 2011 will still be at the company at the end of the month. They are still led by chief executive Ivan Glasenberg, who has said he plans to retire within five years and pass on the baton to the next generation. The break-up of the so-called billionaires boys’ club, which has run the company since a management buyout in 1993, comes as Glencore faces a US Department of Justice investigation into possible corruption and bribery. The probe has hung over the company’s shares, which are down 10 per cent this year and lagging behind those of major rivals. As the full extent of the DoJ investigation has never been revealed, investors remain nervous. Glencore disclosed the investigation last July.   The situation at Glencore does seem to be slowly changing, but they have a lot more to do to regain investors’ trustNatasha Landell-Mills, Sarasin & Partners The US probe into Glencore’s activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Venezuela centre on the copper and oil businesses once run by Mr Beard and Mr Mistakidis. Some view their departures as paving the way for an eventual deal with US regulators, while others say Mr Beard decided to move on after being overlooked as a possible successor to Mr Glasenberg.   Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at Sarasin & Partners, who sold their stake in Glencore last year because of regulatory worries, said the departure of some top executives was just an initial step to reassure investors. “While the removal of key personnel from areas of the company allegedly connected to these investigations is a start, we really want to see much more,” she said, arguing at a minimum Glencore needed to launch an independent investigation of its internal controls. “The situation at Glencore does seem to be slowly changing, but they have a lot more to do to regain investors’ trust,” Ms Landell-Mills said, urging greater transparency from the company “over how value is being created”.  Analysts say the management overhaul will probably accelerate a shift at the $44bn company that was well under way: the shift into managing assets rather than simply trading them. Since Glencore’s 2013 takeover of Xstrata, a major mining house, it has been much more reliant on mining even if the riskier business of trading remains in its DNA. Last year, Glencore’s mining assets generated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $13.2bn. That compares with the $2.5bn generated from trading. When the company listed in 2011, the split was roughly 50:50. When Mr Beard leaves the company his role will be split in two, with Alex Sanna, a 37-year-old Italian, overseeing oil trading. The challenge of running Glencore’s oil production assets in Africa will fall to Peter Freyberg, who has emerged as one of the most powerful executives at the company.  A mining industry veteran who effectively rejoined Glencore through its takeover of Xstrata, Mr Freyberg was handed oversight and responsibility for all of Glencore’s mines late last year. “I think it’s interesting Peter has taken control of all Glencore’s physical assets,” said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They seem to be moving towards a structure that would perhaps be more familiar to a traditional miner, where operations and trading are not held under the same umbrella.” Analysts are hoping that Mr Freyberg can bring some of the technical rigour from the coal business to Glencore’s African copper operations. They were overseen by Mr Mistakidis, who had spent most of his career as a trader rather than a mining engineer. If Glencore is to live up to its ambitions to be the miner best placed to benefit from the electric vehicle revolution, its mines in Zambia and the DRC — and, in particular, Katanga Mining — need to be firing on all cylinders.  After being fined by Canadian regulators for issuing false and misleading statements at the back end of last year, Katanga recently cut guidance and launched a review of its operations. Mr Freyberg has appointed one of his key lieutenants, Jeff Gerard, to run Katanga. “Over the long term we see the potential for Glencore to significantly improve its [African] copper business,” said Credit Suisse analyst Sam Catalano. As more of Glencore’s old guard depart, the question of who will replace Mr Glasenberg, 62, is becoming more clearly defined. Despite his star being in the ascendancy, the 59-year old Mr Freyberg appears to be out of the running.  “When I go, I hope it’ll be a 45-year-old who will take over,” Mr Glasenberg told analysts and investors in December. That suggests Mr Glasenberg’s successor is likely to be one of the new divisional heads. The names to watch include Mr Sanna, Gary Nagle, the South African executive who runs Glencore’s coal mines, and Nico Paraskevas, head of copper trading. Nickel trading boss Kenny Ives cannot be ruled out. Whoever eventually takes the top job, they will be running a different company to the one Mr Beard joined more than 20 years ago.","05.06.2019"
"JPMorgan plan to coin it on the blockchain","‘JPM Coins’ designed to expedite dollar-based payments for companies","JPMorgan Chase has announced a plan to use blockchain technology to expedite dollar-based payments for its corporate banking clients, making it one of the first global banks to incorporate digital coin technology into its core business.  “JPM Coins” will be transferable over a blockchain between the accounts of the bank’s corporate clients, who will purchase and redeem them for dollars at a fixed 1:1 ratio, making them “stablecoins” in the crypto-jargon.  The technology will facilitate near-instantaneous settlement of these money transfers and will, according to the bank, mitigate counterparty risk. The payment technology is a prototype, and JPMorgan plans to roll it out to a small number of clients within a few months. Combining shared databases and cryptography, blockchain technology allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger that cannot be altered.  Having initially been sceptical about the technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, banks have in recent years started to explore its potential uses.  Yet some observers question the value of using blockchain technology for intra-bank payments. Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the UK’s Center for Evidence-Based Management, said that “fundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain . . . there are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.” JPMorgan said there were limits to instantaneous intra-bank cash payments, and it hopes JPM Coin may open the way for other blockchain applications.  “Even in the simplest case of money movement across institutional clients of the same bank, there are cut-offs across borders so not all transactions can be done real time 24/7,” said Umar Farooq, head of digital treasury services and blockchain at the bank.  “In addition, there are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary.” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, called bitcoin a “fraud” a few years ago, threatening to fire employees who traded in it, but he has since expressed regret about the comment and endorsed the potential of the underlying blockchain technology. Gabriel Wang, analyst at Aite Group, said applications of the distributed ledger technology underpinning blockchain systems in areas such as trading might lead to improvements in transparency and record keeping. “I don't think that settlements are the endgame for JPM Coin,” he said. Other banks continue to experiment with blockchain. For example, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street teamed up on a common “utility settlement coin” created by Switzerland’s UBS, designed to be convertible into cash at central banks. The consortium had hoped to launch the coins in late 2018, but the project is yet to go live.  HSBC has used a blockchain technology, dubbed “FX Everywhere” to help settle some 3m foreign-exchange transactions worth $250bn — a small part of its overall FX trading business. The tools serve to simplify internal trade flows by capturing transactions between different parts of the bank on a single ledger. ","14.02.2019"
"Centrica’s £2.4m CEO pay suggests it hasn’t checked the weather","Iain Conn’s 44% rise comes despite the closest thing to a profit warning","British Gas owner Centrica, for all its smart meters and connected home hubs, cannot predict the February weather. But, given all of its historical data, it should know which way the wind is blowing on executive pay. It has now conducted 24 annual votes on bosses’ bonuses since Cedric Brown’s 75 per cent pay rise — to £475,000 a year — inspired protesters to name a pig after him, and bring it to the 1995 shareholder meeting, where it eschewed the in-house catering in favour of a trough of treacle-covered £5 notes. And yet, on Monday, the energy group still expected shareholders to back a 44 per cent pay rise for current boss Iain Conn — to £2.42m for last year — despite serving them the closest thing to a profit warning and saying nothing about their much feared-for dividend. Perhaps the board was emboldened by the demise of the porcine Cedric in a bread-eating accident some years ago. Or insufficiently scared by the GMB union’s evocation of “The Ghost of Cedric The Pig” — a spectre that becomes less terrifying when imagined scoffing a loaf of sliced white. Arguably, Centrica had got its forecast right on pay: this time, only 15 per cent of shareholders voted against Mr Conn’s remuneration. Mr Brown’s was opposed by 17 per cent. Still, how much longer can other investors remain supportive — given the adverse climate the group faces? In its trading update, Centrica warned that falling gas prices, tariff caps and warmer than normal first-quarter weather — including the hottest ever February day — would put “further pressure on the outlook for the full year”. As the first quarter is typically the coldest and most lucrative for its British Gas division, the chances of Centrica making up the lost profit are rather like the chances of Lucifer turning up the thermostat.  Against this, Mr Conn’s £2.42m looks like money for just turning up. His pay was boosted by a £776,000 bonus for achieving growth in areas that were always going to grow — ie, selling Hive home hubs, and helping corporate customers manage their bills — and for cutting expenditure in areas where exposure was going to reduce, ie oil and gas exploration and production. UK customer churn rates look no better — another 234,000 left in the quarter, a similar percentage to last year and more than some analysts had hoped. Pension deficit worries remain — addressing this may hit cash flow as proceeds from disposals look set to be delayed. Full-year cash flow and debt guidance has been maintained but much else in 2019’s performance now depends on achieving more job cuts and cost efficiencies. In fact, with limited growth prospects, and continued pricing pressure, several analysts doubt Centrica’s dividend can be sustainable. RBC’s forecast a 40 per cent cut. Credit Suisse’s assume a 33 per cent reduction. Kepler’s even call for one. And, unlike otherworldly oink of the Ghost of Cedric, this is one demand for lower pay that Centrica might heed. Loss of Dignity Dignity, the funeral business, is distinctly lacking in gravitas, writes Kate Burgess. On Monday, it warned analysts that 2019 profit would be lower than expected. Its shares lurched down again, having halved since 2018. Death has been on a go-slow, the company said. Whatever the reason — an unseasonably warm winter, perhaps — mortalities in the first quarter fell 12 per cent. But Dignity’s operating profit plummeted 42 per cent, pushing analysts to cut full-year pre-nasties earnings forecasts by nearly a tenth. Although market share increased a fraction to about 12 per cent, costs — including marketing — also rose. Declines in mortality make life grim for Dignity on many levels. Aside from the effect on revenues, high fixed costs have to be spread among fewer customers. In the past, Dignity has (more than) protected its 25 per cent margin by hiking prices. But, last year, its main rival slashed prices forcing Dignity to follow suit.  Now the UK regulator is examining whether competition works properly in the sector, or whether funeral directors are gouging vulnerable customers. Cremation and burial costs have risen at more than twice the rate of inflation for a decade and a half. Dignity maintains that the drop in 2019 deaths will normalise to 3 per cent by the year-end. And longer-term, deaths will rise from about 550,000 a year to the 700,000 seen in the 1980s. That is the grim reality, says Dignity. And it really, really hopes it is right.  Metro: antisocial media Does social media encourage antisocial behaviour? It certainly seems to have made some Metro Bank customers miss Sunday lunch. When they read Twitter and WhatsApp posts about queues in branches, they apparently joined them, fearing for the bank’s health. Had they instead read the FT scoop about a capital-boosting sale of loans, they might have enjoyed a more sociable weekend. matthew.vincent@ft.com

Before we start there is news this morning that Thomas Cook is seeking a £750m capital injection from Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate and biggest shareholder in the UK tour operator. Under the terms of the agreement, Fosun would take a controlling stake in Thomas Cook’s core tour operator business and a “significant” holding in the airline.

 On with Friday’s Opening Quote…

 Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam has been the talk of the town again, after Christine Lagarde’s likely departure from the IMF to head the ECB leaves vacant one of the roles that the Franco-Ivorian financier has long been linked with. Mr Thiam has never spoken publicly about his interest in the job. But friends say he would be an ideal choice, enabling the IMF to make a switch to an emerging markets nominee that could still be palatable to France. (French nationals have held the managing director role five out of 11 times since its post-war foundation). Rumours that Mr Thiam has discussed the issue with French president Emmanuel Macron are disputed. But the advice was allegedly to focus on the role next time round, not now. At least that’ll give TT time to boost the CS share price, after years of stagnation. Briefly   US private equity group Bain Capital has agreed to buy a 60 per cent stake in WPP’s market research business Kantar, in a transaction that values the subsidiary at around $4bn. If successful, WPP is expected to generate $3.1bn of proceeds after tax. It will use 60 per cent of the gains to reduce its debt and will hand out the remaining $1.2bn to its shareholders, it said on Friday. Marks and Spencer has lost its fourth clothing chief in a decade as the British retailer struggles to turn round the business and attract younger customers. Jill McDonald, managing director of M&S’s clothing and home arm for just over 18 months, will step down with immediate effect, the company said. It is thought she was asked to leave, say people familiar with the situation. Lloyd’s of London chief executive John Neal said he is prepared to force through his proposed changes to cut costs, including an electronic exchange, even if some of them face opposition. Mr Neal said on Thursday a 10-week consultation process had revealed plenty of support for his ideas. But he added that, once the next steps had been decided, brokers and underwriters, who negotiate the policies, would have to sign up. UK defence group BAE Systems is hopeful it can seal a deal with New Zealand for its advanced warships in a contract that could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. A deal with New Zealand would extend a run of international successes that BAE has achieved with the new Type 26 frigate even before the first vessel of the class is delivered to the UK’s Royal Navy.  Job moves   Julie Sweet has been named chief executive of Accenture, becoming the first female leader of the consulting giant as it expands its focus on technological and digital transformation. Ms Sweet, who currently runs Accenture North America, will succeed David Rowland, who has served as interim chief executive since the company’s popular leader Pierre Nanterme stepped down shortly before his death in January. Amanda Blanc’s departure from Zurich insurance last week left the Association of British Insurers with a headache. Ms Blanc was the chair of the trade body, but had to step down as she was no longer working as a chief exec in the industry. Next into the ABI hotseat is John Dye, head of Allianz’s UK business.

"Private equity consortium to buy Inmarsat in $6bn deal","Group led by Apax and Warburg Pincus swoops for UK satellite communications company","Britain’s largest satellite company Inmarsat will return to private equity ownership almost 15 years after it was floated, in a deal that values the group at about $6bn including debt. Private equity firms led by Apax and Warburg Pincus will pay $7.21 in cash per Inmarsat share — a 27 per cent premium to the closing price of £4.31 on March 18 — the companies said on Monday. Inmarsat, which will continue to be based in the UK, has regularly been linked with a takeover by an industry rival but has struggled to attract investors because of its recent poor performance.  EchoStar, a US company controlled by billionaire Charlie Ergen, bid for the company last year as it sought to acquire Inmarsat’s valuable spectrum holdings in the US — but ditched the takeover attempt after it was deemed too low. Eutelsat, a European rival, also looked at buying the business while SoftBank, which has backed satellite start-up, OneWeb, was also loosely linked with a deal. Inmarsat was founded in the 1970s as a maritime safety company to launch satellites that could locate distress signals from ships. It was originally an inter-governmental organisation but over time became a commercial entity targeting growth from customers that needed satellite communications in remote areas. That included armed forces and aviation businesses.  Apax — alongside Permira — acquired the business in 2003 and led its flotation on the London markets in 2005 but the company’s financial performance has been volatile. It has invested heavily in a new fleet of satellites to deliver mobile broadband services to its maritime and aviation customers but moving its customers off older satellite terminals has been a slow process.  Inmarsat has targeted in-flight connectivity as a potential growth driver but that segment has yet to offset lower legacy revenue. The group of investors, which also includes Canada’s CPPIB and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, said: “The satellite sector is attractive, with unique characteristics, including long lead times and the need for deep technical expertise, while operators in the sector require strategic management and a long investment horizon.” It added that Inmarsat was well placed for growth and that the group was looking to benefit from long-term contracts with governments and others, although returns were “difficult to predict”. Overcapacity has become a significant issue in the sector as established players, many of which carry heavy debt burdens, have launched new satellites at great cost. Meanwhile smaller start-ups including OneWeb have sought to compete with the older companies by launching lower-cost fleets of smaller satellites. It emerged last week that Inmarsat had received a non-binding offer from the consortium. The previous interest from EchoStar and Eutelsat had raised hopes of a counterbid for the London-listed company. However the large cash element of the offer has cooled expectations that a rival offer will be placed. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. If it goes through it would remove another listed company from the UK’s thinning ranks of listed communications businesses. Private equity groups are increasingly looking to take companies private as valuations in private markets have hit an all-time high. JPMorgan Cazenove, PJT Partners and Credit Suisse advised Inmarsat on the potential transaction. UBS advised the bidders. Inmarsat’s share price rose 9 per cent to 551.4p on Monday morning.","25.03.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Vodafone, Intel, Fevertree, Hammerson, Intu, ITV","Commercial property stocks are heading for a fall, says Citigroup","Friday 12:30 GMT What’s happening ● Vodafone retreated after posting a sharper than expected fall in quarterly revenue due largely to problems in South Africa reported yesterday. Full-year guidance was reiterated. On an adjusted basis, Vodafone’s service revenue for the fiscal third quarter was down 0.8 per cent versus a 0.7 per cent decline expected by the consensus. The figure would have been worse had it not been for currency effects, which included inflation in Turkey that turned a revenue decline in euro terms of around 18 per cent into 14.8 per cent growth.  On the conference call, Vodafone management was confident that revenue would pick up from the start of its next financial year in April as commercial performance improves, competition lessens and price cuts in Italy and Spain fall out of year-on-year comparisons.  ● Intel plunged in US pre-market trading after missing expectations with its fourth-quarter results and cutting first-quarter guidance. The company highlighted weakening demand for datacentres, a sales shortfall for modems and pricing pressure on flash memory chips as problem areas. “Management’s expectations for 2019 point to a modest 1 per cent revenue growth rate and a contraction in operating margin, which we view as a significant change in tempo following circa two years of meaningful expansion under CFO and interim CEO Bob Swan.”Goldman Sachs Repeating “sell” advice, Goldman argued that “the bar is particularly high” for Intel in 2019 because competition was increasing and its previous growth drivers, most notably datacentres, were going into reverse. Sellside stories ● Jefferies downgraded Fevertree Drinks, the tonic water maker, to “hold” from “buy”. “Fevertree [is] one of the most attractive growth stories in European beverages given the potential for premium mixers internationally. However, near-term there is risk of a hiatus . . . as growth in the UK core business moderates before the future growth engine, the US, accelerates.”Jefferies A 5 per cent deceleration in the UK would require 20 per cent acceleration in the US to maintain Fevertree’s group growth, Jefferies said, adding: “Whilst we do not rule out faster than expected growth given the company’s historical track record of under-promising and over-delivering, UK Nielsen data will likely continue to point to normalisation of demand in the UK.” Nielsen data for December published today showed Fevertree’s UK sales growth slowing to 26.2 per cent, from 27.3 per cent and 31.8 per cent in the previous two reports. That implied growth in Fevertree’s key market had slowed from 97 per cent in the first quarter 2018 to 28.4 per cent in the fourth, said Jefferies.  ● Goldman Sachs and Citigroup both turned cautious on European real estate investment trusts. Citi cut recommendations on 14 stocks including British Land, Hammerson
 and Land Securities, while Goldman’s downgrades included Intu and Klépierre. Expect an end to the current European office market cycle, said Citi, as rents “are at or near cyclical peaks”. Supply and demand have been favourable but to make investible returns at current book values, yields need to rise in anticipation of declining rents, it said. “The 20 to 30 per cent capital value decline we forecast is not priced into European real estate stocks [including in the UK],” added Citi. On shopping centres, Citi said that the shift “from brick to clicks is in its infancy meaning the outlook for shopping centre rents and values is increasingly risky”. It forecast valuation downgrades to come of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent.  “Once the negativity of a downturn in real estate markets has begun, historically stocks fall further than what was ultimately born out in direct fundamentals. Stock, and real estate, markets rarely stay flat.”Citi Citi’s note moved to “sell” ratings on British Land, Carmila, Coima Res, Colonial, Covivio, Derwent London, Gecina, Great Portland Estates, Hammerson, Icade, Intu Properties, Klépierre, Land Securities and Merlin Properties. Shaftesbury was downgraded to “neutral”. Goldman also argued that commercial real estate markets had peaked, “most obviously in retail but also in offices”. It advised clients to seek out the patches of strength, such as in residential and offices in continental Europe. It moved to “sell” ratings on Castellum, Intu, Mercialys and Merlin Properties, with Alstria and Klépierre cut to “neutral”. However, the broker also upgraded Land Securities to “neutral” and added both Gecina and Grand City to its “buy” list.  ● In brief: AstraZeneca upgraded to “buy” at Shore Capital; Bakkavor cut to “hold” at HSBC; Cranswick rated “hold” at HSBC; Dairy Crest rated “buy” at HSBC; Fresnillo upgraded to “buy” at UBS; Gjensidige cut to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Greencore rated “buy” at HSBC; Hilton Food rated “hold” at HSBC; Iberdrola upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; ITV downgraded to “hold” at Société Générale; NCC upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup; SCA cut to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; SGS downgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Spectris upgraded to “buy” at Investec; Sureserve raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Swatch downgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse.

"Swiss plans for whistleblowers fall short, critics say","Staff who report wrongdoing risk losing their jobs or even criminal prosecution","Swiss government plans to update laws on whistleblowers will fail to provide sufficient protection for employees who reveal corporate wrongdoing, according to anti-corruption campaigners. The role of whistleblowers in uncovering European company scandals has been highlighted this year by Danske Bank, where a former executive helped to reveal a €200bn money-laundering scandal.  Legislative changes proposed by the Swiss government fall short of international best practice on protecting whistleblowers from dismissal and the circumstances in which they can report corruption to law enforcement authorities or the media, said Martin Hilti, executive director in Switzerland of Transparency International, a non-governmental organisation. “Unfortunately, Swiss lawmakers so far have consistently avoided providing adequate whistleblower protection. They seem to have not yet understood its importance for employees, but also the value added for Swiss companies and Switzerland as a business location,” Mr Hilti said.  Switzerland is the world’s largest cross-border wealth manager and relies on its financial sector as a bastion of its economy. Since the global financial crisis its banks have focused increasingly on looking after the assets of the world’s richest. But the country has a mixed reputation on the treatment of whistleblowers. Among the best known is Hervé Falciani, a former HSBC IT specialist who leaked data about thousands of wealthy customers. Falciani argued he was a whistleblower who wanted to expose a banking system which encouraged tax evasion. But Swiss authorities claim he stole and then attempted to sell confidential data and have tried to have him extradited from Spain. A Spanish court rejected the request in September. Swiss companies have a tradition of discretion and protecting privacy, despite a global crackdown on tax evasion. “I am not convinced that whistleblowers like at Danske would have a lot of protection in Switzerland,” said Simone Nadelhofer, partner at the Lalive law firm in Zurich. “On the contrary, experience shows that in Switzerland whistleblowers are regularly convicted by criminal authorities for breach of secrecy obligations.” Mr Hilti said: “If you are a whistleblower [in Switzerland] you have to carefully consider the risks because you are risking an awful lot — losing your job, not getting another one, becoming a social outcast or even criminal prosecution. It’s a high price.” Transparency International argues that robust rules on whistleblowers are in companies’ interest and essential for uncovering white-collar crimes. “Whistleblower protection must be part of the culture from the top down,” said Mr Hilti. The biggest Swiss companies have taken their own action — some 70 per cent have internal or external reporting stations for whistleblowers, according to a survey this year by the University of Applied Sciences in Chur. But just 10 per cent of small and medium-sized business had such systems. Switzerland’s two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have aligned in-house whistleblower schemes to global standards. Credit Suisse told the Financial Times that its provisions went beyond the requirements of Swiss law with systems that included a 24-hour staffed “integrity hotline”.
 Swiss politicians have been arguing for more than a decade about steps to strengthen protections. In the latest draft, published in September, Bern sought to clarify when whistleblowers could turn to law enforcement organisations or go public with information. The plans have yet to be discussed in the Swiss parliament. But Mr Hilti said that even after the revisions, the obstacles would be too great for whistleblowers who wished to escalate reports to law enforcement agencies. Transparency International also argues for much higher compensation payments for employees dismissed after acting in good faith as whistleblowers. In response, the federal justice office in Bern said the government was undertaking a general review of laws on dismissing employees but that politicians had so far failed to agree reforms with employers and trade unions. Meanwhile, the conditions under which whistleblowers could refer complaints to law enforcement authorities or the media had to take into account employees’ duties to their companies. The planned revisions to the Swiss law represented a “reasonable balance”, said an official.","08.01.2019"
"Opening Quote: Ted Baker warns profits will be lower than last year","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email. Ted Baker’s trading report on Tuesday was flagged ahead of time as a “key update for Ted, setting a benchmark for year-to-date performance against subdued market expectations” by analysts at Peel Hunt.  There has been much to subdue expectations. A hugging scandal involving the company’s founder meant a new chief executive, Lindsay Page. It has also repeatedly warned on profits and trading amid a tough period for the high street. The retailer took an extra blow last year from the collapse of House of Fraser.  Still, analysts had hoped for underlying pre-tax profits of around £70m for the year to January 2020. Instead, Ted Baker is on Tuesday warning they will only get £50m-£60m — less than last year.  The company has blamed “difficult and unpredictable trading conditions”, “unseasonable weather” in North America (everyone always blames the weather) and a “highly promotional retail environment”. On top of that it messed up its spring/summer lines. Like-for-like sales for the 19 weeks to June 8 were 1.1 per cent lower. Margins are also down.  This is not exactly the benchmark investors were hoping for. Briefly Saga has unveiled a partnership with Goldman Sachs’ consumer bank Marcus. The over-50s group said it had picked Marcus as its long-term savings partner and would launch new products together from the autumn of this year. Marcus launched in the UK in September last year with an easy-access savings account and has since attracted 250,000 customers. The initiative comes as Saga embarks on a difficult turnround programme. Crest Nicholson, the housebuilder, reported an 11 per cent year-on-year fall in profits in its half-year update, to £64m. Revenues held up better, rising 7 per cent to £502m. The group announced a strategy shift last year to overcome a slowing market in London and the south-east, shifting its business more towards partnerships and joint ventures. That helped lower its risk, but means lower profits. The group is still awaiting new chief executive Peter Truscott, who is set to join from Galliford Try later this year. Elsewhere, the food service group Compass has announced a €475m acquisition (including debt) of a Nordic catering group, Fazer Food Services. It will pay €420m in cash upfront, with the rest dependent on business performance. Housebuilder Bellway has a trading update out for the 4 months to the start of June. The reservation rate was up 4.7 per cent year-on-year, but there has been pressure on margins as house price inflation moderates and wages tick up.  Finally, West End landlord Shaftesbury has been served with legal proceedings in relation to its dispute with shareholder Samuel Tak Lee. He is seeking £10.4m in damages in relation to a placing in December 2017.  Job moves  Sainsbury’s has appointed ex-RBS banker Jim Brown to head up its banking arm. The former chief executive of Williams and Glyn will join as CEO-designate of Sainsbury’s Bank next week. The bank has been a drag on the rest of Sainsbury’s in recent quarters, and after a costly restructuring, Mr Brown’s challenge will be to prove why it’s worthwhile the supermarket having a bank at all. Barclays has made Stephen Dainton’s appointment as interim global head of markets permanent. He joined the bank on 2017 as its global markets boss. Before that, he spent 14 years at Credit Suisse.  Housebuilder MJ Gleeson’s chief executive, Jolyon Harrison, has left abruptly following a disagreement with the board over pay and succession planning. He becomes the second industry boss to leave over pay issues in less than a year.  We’re looking to feature more job moves.

 Beyond the Square Mile   New powers given to Europe’s banking watchdog are not enough to stem the tide of dirty money sweeping through the European Union, José Manuel Campa, the new chief executive of the European Banking Authority, told the FT in his first interview.  Donald Trump has waded into the planned merger of United Technologies and Raytheon, suggesting the deal that would create an aerospace and defence giant could be bad for competition in the sector. But the announcement failed to excite investors — as this analysis explains. Nissan’s chief executive has said that the Japanese carmaker must “make our peace” with Renault after a feud threatened to rip apart the 20-year alliance between the two companies. Staying with the transport sector and Lilium, a Munich-based flying taxi start-up, plans to create “hundreds of high-end software engineering roles” at its new London hub over the next five years. As expectations have increased that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut US interest rates as early as next month, investors have sold bank stocks. The worst performers in the widely followed KBW Bank Index are overwhelmingly rate-sensitive banks, including Bank of America, Silicon Valley Bank and Bank of New York Mellon, all down 7 per cent or more.

"World Cup deals that keep haunting officials linked to foul play","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Footballers are known for their bad behaviour. Their affairs, addictions, and public scrapes are a source of endless tabloid fodder. But bad behaviour seems to be entrenched in the institutions that govern the sport, as well. Take Fifa, international football’s governing body, for example.   
  Four years ago, Swiss authorities descended on the luxury Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich, where officials were gathering for their annual meeting, and livened things up. Many senior figures from football’s governing body were arrested on corruption charges over the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.   The controversial decision to award Qatar the right to host the 2022 World Cup left many spectators dumbfounded. Temperatures in the gas-rich Gulf state can exceed 40C in the summer, not exactly prime conditions for a 90-minute football game, not to mention the desert country’s lack of stadiums and alleged mistreatment of migrant workers. Nine days before Qatar was announced as the winner of the 2022 bid, beating out favourites the US, French football icon Michel Platini (pictured) and then president Nicolas Sarkozy sat down for lunch at the Elysée Palace. Unbeknown to Platini, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, the crown prince of Qatar, would also be attending.    
  The sequence of events has placed the Elysée meeting at the heart of a global corruption investigation. Platini, widely regarded as one of the greatest players to have graced the pitch, has become one of the most high-profile figures to be embroiled in the affair. Investigators brought Platini in for questioning on Tuesday over his involvement in the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. They want to know whether the former French football captain received bribes in exchange for his vote for Qatar, an accusation he denies. In fact, the former Uefa president says he requested the lunch with Sarkozy to tell him of his decision to vote for Qatar. Platini denied having received any direct instructions from Sarkozy. “Sarkozy never asked me to vote for Qatar, but I knew what would be good,” he said in 2015. Before the investigation Platini had planned an attempt to run for the Fifa’s presidency, a role that eventually went to Gianni Infantino, once his subordinate at Uefa, in 2015. Platini had resigned from his post after receiving a multiyear ban from football for ethics violations.  Infantino quite likes a private meeting or two himself. He had several with Switzerland’s federal prosecutor, Michael Lauber, who was leading the investigation into corruption at Fifa and was forced on Tuesday to recuse himself from the probe as a result. While Lauber admitted to the first two meetings, and later a third, both men seem to have had a memory lapse. Lauber can’t remember what was discussed and Infantino can’t even remember the meetings happening. Meanwhile, Sarkozy (pictured below), who played lunch host, has had a healthy relationship with Qatar. During his presidency he played an active role in brokering the purchase by Qatar Sports Investments of Paris Saint-Germain football team from US private equity group Colony Capital.   
  And before he’d reignited hopes of another go at his political career, Sarkozy received a €250m pledge from Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund to start a private equity fund. Sarkozy has his own legal problems to contend with, however. He is to stand trial on accusations of influence peddling in a different investigation.

Nothing to drink: Morningstar suspends rating on H2O fund  When the well is dry, we know the worth of water. It’s a phrase that seemed especially apt to DD after a fund run by H2O Asset Management had its rating suspended by the influential Morningstar rating agency on Wednesday. If you hadn’t heard of H2O before DD reported on the fund on Tuesday, you may very well have heard of its parent: France’s Natixis Investment Managers, which also counts Loomis Sayles among its affiliated asset managers and ranks as one of the largest money managers in the world. It feels like everyone is having a drink out of H2O’s metaphorical cup now. Interest was piqued after DD’s Rob Smith and the FT’s Cynthia O'Murchu reported that H2O’s funds had substantial holdings of illiquid bonds related to controversial German financier Lars Windhorst. Interest in both Windhorst, the flamboyant entrepreneur with a history of legal troubles, and H2O chief executive Bruno Crastes (pictured) has soared.  By Wednesday, in a bid to damp down the excitement, H2O sent a message to clients to reassure them about the liquidity of their investments. That message, DD can reveal, provided detail around H2O’s strategy of investing in what it calls “non-rated, mostly European, corporate credit securities”, explaining that these holdings had been “fully disclosed to our clients and auditors”. “In many instances, H2O funds have been able to trade these bonds with different counterparts despite dire liquidity conditions,” the statement added. But hours after it sent that message on Wednesday, the bomb dropped: Morningstar suspended its bronze rating on H2O’s Allegro Fund, citing concerns over “the liquidity of certain bonds”.

Blackstone boss Stephen Schwarzman has joined the ranks of billionaire benefactors to Oxford university with the largest individual donation in its modern history — £150m.  Schwarzman has bested the likes of Ukrainian-born tycoon Len Blavatnik, after whom the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford is named. DD art aficionados can also find Blavatnik at the Tate Modern, having paid a large sum for the art gallery’s extension. The £150m donation, which will be used for the construction of a new hub and an institute focused on the ethical questions around artificial intelligence, will, of course, earn Schwarzman a namesake building — the Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities. Oxford university has earmarked land near the Blavatnik school of government and the Radcliffe observatory in the city centre for the 23,000 square metre centre, which it intends to complete by 2024. While Schwarzman’s gift to Oxford is the largest in the university’s history, going back as far as the Renaissance, Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, tops the list as the largest single overseas donation to a UK university. He gifted $210m to Cambridge university in 2000. UK universities like Oxford and Cambridge have become increasingly reliant on philanthropic gifts as pressure on revenues from tuition and research grants intensifies. DD readers can also find Schwarzman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he made a $350m contribution last year to the Schwarzman College of Computing and at the Stephen Schwarzman Center at Yale University where he donated $150m. The Blackstone chief also launched a scholarship in Beijing, modelled on Oxford’s Rhodes scholarships.  Sycamore is looking for a sale at Chico’s During the financial crisis, retailers fell into crisis. Unsold inventory was building up and next season’s collections were already on container ships bound for the US. So what did they do? Marked everything down. In doing so, they conditioned consumers to wait for a sale. Why pay full price when you know a discount is around the corner? It appears private equity group Sycamore Partners is stuck in the same mentality. Sycamore disclosed on Wednesday that it had offered $3 a share to buy women’s clothing retailer Chico’s. That’s down from the $3.50 offer it presented in May and $4.30 bid it offered in April. Chico’s has rejected the earlier two offers and the latest bid is likely to antagonise the company further.

"Tencent follows Google into cloud gaming with ‘Start’ pilot","Chinese tech giant is testing new service in Shanghai and Guangdong","Chinese tech giant Tencent is following Google and Microsoft into cloud gaming by quietly testing a new service called “Start”.  Start is available for test use in Shanghai and Guangdong, according to a recently launched website, promising to put high-quality gaming within reach on any device, at any time. With cloud gaming, all of the action happens on servers in data centres, rather than a player’s own hardware, with images streamed to users’ screens.  Tencent is joining a growing number of players, including Sony, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, who are positioning themselves for what some in the games industry have hailed as the biggest disruption since the arrival of the smartphone more than a decade ago.   Last month, Google unveiled a cloud gaming service called Stadia, which will stream games directly from Google’s data centres to televisions, smartphones and computers. The service is expected to launch later this year, alongside Microsoft’s previously announced rival xCloud.  Tencent’s biggest advantage over Google has historically been its online gaming business, which accounted for more than 40 per cent of its overall revenues before the Chinese government imposed a nine-month ban on new computer games last year. Gaming accounted for just over one-third of revenues in the most recent quarter.  While Google is teaming up with chipmaker AMD for the graphics in Stadia, Tencent said last year it planned to work with Intel on its cloud gaming service.  Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS Markit Technology, said cloud was the “new competitive front” in the gaming industry, adding that Tencent may have some advantages over Google when it comes to its games catalogue and market penetration in China.  “Google has a global presence with its cloud services, but no access to China,” Mr Harding-Rolls said. “Tencent has less global presence, but is a gatekeeper to the biggest games market in China.” “Tencent has a much stronger content offering,” he added. “Google may well acquire to overcome this.” In addition to its own gaming capabilities, Tencent also owns 88 per cent of Supercell, the Finnish maker of Clash of Clans and Hay Day, as well as stakes in Fortnite developer Epic Games and Riot Games, maker of League of Legends. Tencent signalled its interest in cloud at its annual results last month.  “It’s something we are naturally very excited about, it’s something we’re looking into, but it will take a few years to fully materialise,” James Mitchell, Tencent’s chief strategy officer, said at the time. Mr Harding-Rolls said any returns from cloud gaming would probably be incremental for the company.  “It may introduce existing gamers to new ways of consuming games — thus increasing engagement and spend — and may also reach a new audience, but probably slowly over time,” he said.  Bao Rencheng, analyst at ICBC International, was ambivalent about Tencent’s latest move, saying Chinese gaming had “entered a mature phase”. “The demographic dividend has been used up,” he said. “Those who play games already play games. It is very difficult now to get new players.” IHS Markit estimates the cloud gaming content subscription market will grow from $234m last year to $1.5bn by 2023, and has flagged Tencent and Microsoft as potential winners in the new market.  Alongside existing services from Sony and chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon is expected to launch its own cloud gaming platform, capitalising on its investments in data centres and connectivity around the world.  Critics, however, have questioned how profitable the market will be.  “Five companies have announced they want to be the Netflix of games,” Owen Mahoney, chief executive and president of South Korean game developer Nexon, said at a Credit Suisse conference in Hong Kong last week.  But he added Netflix’s operating margins were below those of games developers, saying: “No one is getting a head start now.” Additional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing and Tim Bradshaw in London

"Stocks to watch: 888, Boohoo, Provident Financial, Spire, AMS, DIA","Slowing growth and rising costs point to falls for capital goods stocks, says SocGen","Tuesday 13:30 GMT What’s happening ● Online casino operator 888
 led UK gaming stocks lower after the US Department of Justice reversed a previous decision and ruled that online gambling across state borders was illegal. Its opinion related to the Wire Act, which was rolled back in 2011 to include sports betting but not casino games, and was not expected to affect last year’s Supreme Court repeal of a federal ban on sports betting. This shouldn’t have any significant impact on sports betting as the Wire Act is already applied to this market, which is currently managed on a state-by-state basis. The biggest question mark is for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) and online poker as the two take place on an inter-state basisAlphavalue Paddy Power-Betfair, which last year bought a 61 per cent stake in US-based DFS operator FanDuel, was the biggest faller among the traditional bookmakers.  ● Provident Financial led the FTSE 250 fallers after a warning from the doorstep lender that full-year earnings would be at the lower end of market expectations. It blamed higher than expected delinquencies and impairments at its Vanquis banking division, as customers made greater use of payment arrangements when in arrears. ● Spire Healthcare retreated after a weaker than expected full-year trading update.  The UK hospital operator said annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be between £119m and £120m before exceptionals, compared with a range set at its September profit warning of £120m to £125m. However, Spire’s net debt was slightly better than consensus expectations at £457m, which eased worries about a potential breach of lending covenants.  ● Boohoo was under pressure even after the online retailer raised full-year targets, as the new guidance only matched consensus expectations. The online retailer said revenue was up 44 per cent over the past four months of 2018 as sales through its majority-owned PrettyLittleThing brand nearly doubled.  Boohoo combines a highly efficient product design, sourcing and merchandising platform with an opportunity to significantly grow its sales base both in the UK and internationally. However, on an ambitious forecast agenda, Boohoo shares are trading at a significant premium to peers. We see this premium as a limit to upside on a 12 month view and therefore assign a neutral ratingCitigroup Sellside stories ● Société Générale cut Atlas Copco, Kion, GEA, Volvo and Osram to “sell” as part of a downgrade of the European capital goods sector.  The growth outlook has turned decisively weaker, with the sector prone to rising risks to margins and declining earnings momentum led by political uncertainty, trade tensions and the spectre of a recession in 2020. With valuations back at a 7 per cent premium to the market and consensus still bullish, we prefer to be exposed to defensive, self-help and late-cycle names while avoiding early and mid-cycle exposures.SocGen Demand would worsen further in 2019 across key regions, most notably in autos and semiconductors, at the same time as companies needed to push through price rises and supply chain restructuring, SocGen said. The slowdown “makes for a heady cocktail, with sector earnings growth likely to slip to the mid-single digits and risks skewed to the downside,” it said. Schindler was SocGen’s top sector pick based on its self-help capabilities and defensive growth markets. The broker also upgraded Weir and DormaKaba
, the former on its exposure to mining and the latter on valuation grounds, and repeated “buy” advice on ABB. Schneider and IMI were both downgraded to “hold”.  ● In brief: Air France-KLM cut to “sell” at Deutsche Bank; AMS rated “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; BBVA cut to “hold” at HSBC; Cairn Energy downgraded to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; DIA upgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Eiffage upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Faroe Petroleum downgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Ferrari raised to market perform at Bernstein; Fresenius SE cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Geberit downgraded to “sell” at Berenberg; Glanbia rated “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Hapag-Lloyd cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; ING upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Lufthansa downgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Maersk downgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Sanne rated “overweight” at JPMorgan; Soco downgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Swatch downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; Symrise downgraded to “neutral” at Davy; TEN Entertainment cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Vaisala downgraded to “reduce” at Inderes; VZ raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse.

"Nestlé skincare unit attracts private equity interest","Sale is expected to fetch around $7bn","Some of the biggest names in private equity are lining up bids for Nestle’s skin health unit in a deal that is expected to fetch around $7bn, according to people close to the process.  First-round bids for the unit, which makes anti-wrinkle creams and a Botox rival called Dysport, are due on Wednesday in a sale process that is being overseen by bankers at Credit Suisse and Evercore. A number of private equity funds have formed consortiums to pool together funds for a bid. Among those expected to bid are a consortium made of Cinven, Advent International and Singapore’s state fund GIC. Others expected to proceed with offers are KKR, Blackstone, Sweden’s EQT and Switzerland’s Partners Group.  Separately, CVC and Carlyle are also expected to submit bids. People with direct knowledge of the process confirmed the bid interest and warned other buyout groups may also enter the race as the deadline drew nearer. All buyout groups and Nestlé declined to comment. GIC was not immediately available for comment. Nestlé has been more active in dealmaking since the arrival in 2017 of chief executive Mark Schneider, its first outside leader since 1922. To boost sluggish sales growth and improve profitability by 2020, Mr Schneider has been seeking to sell assets, such as Herta cold cuts, which no longer met consumer tastes, or skincare, which Nestlé determined was “outside the group’s strategic scope”.  Investors have backed Nestlé, sending its shares up 21 per cent in the past year, compared to a 1.5 per cent decline in the MSCI Europe consumer staples index. But Nestlé still has an activist investor pressuring it to up the pace of change: Dan Loeb’s Third Point owns a 1.3 per cent stake.  The skin health business was a diversification bet made by Mr Schneider’s predecessors, but it has struggled in recent years. Mr Schneider has worked to improve its results before putting it on the block but few financials are disclosed. The division had sales of SFr2.7bn last year and makes prescription items, anti-wrinkle creams and other consumer healthcare products. Other possible bidders might include strategic buyers for parts of the skin health division, but a carved out unit is mostly attractive to buyout groups which would look to buy it as a whole. A private equity owner would look to grow sales through acquisitions and would look at underperforming parts of the business where it can cut costs. This is not the only unit as part of a large conglomerate for sale in Europe. German drug and chemical conglomerate Bayer is also exploring a potential sale for its animal health division, which is expected to attract interest from private equity groups. Private equity interest for carve outs comes at a time when the sector is raising record sums of capital at their fastest pace as investors seek higher returns in a low interest rates environment.","05.03.2019"
"Bankers: the only sure-fire winners from the IPO boom","Fees for underwriting public offerings such as Uber and Pinterest remain high","Wall Street’s IPO machine is humming. Fresh off the high-profile listings of ride-hailing company Lyft and scrapbooking site Pinterest, Uber is expected to go public next month in what looks like one of the largest US tech IPOs ever. Other smaller and less well-known companies in various sectors are also in the mix. Beyond Meat, a California-based company that makes vegan burgers meant to replicate the look and taste of beef, is set for an IPO next week, while Luckin Coffee, the fast-growing Chinese coffee-selling company that aims to be larger than Starbucks there, has also unveiled plans for US listing. With US stocks hovering near record highs, and the economy doing fine for now, more are likely to follow. But it will take time to know which (if any) of the latest crop of tech IPOs will be winners. Lyft, for example, has struggled and is stalled out well below the offer price. Shares of online scrapbooking site Pinterest, by contrast, are comfortably in the black. But the reverse could easily be true three months or three years from now. Companies, too, can pay a price for public ownership. That includes leaving “too much money on the table” — Wall Street parlance for selling shares too cheaply. There are also new burdens involved in being a public company. The shareholder base, for example, now includes shorter-term investors with a fixation on quarterly results, making the stock price vulnerable to swings. One group, though, has clear early gains: bankers. “There is no question that, in the short run, it is good times for the middle men,” says Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. “It will definitely be a good year for fee income on IPOs.” Wall Street investment banks act as the main go-between for investors and companies in IPOs. Fees for banks that underwrite IPOs are charged as a percentage of the proceeds raised. Over time, these fees have fallen: to below 6 per cent on average so far this year, from 7 per cent and higher in the late 1990s, according to Dealogic. But they vary considerably depending on the size of the offering. Companies that raised more than $1bn have paid an average of 4.42 per cent of proceeds year to date and 3.88 per cent in 2018, compared with 3.55 per cent 20 years ago. Very hot, consumer-facing tech companies are also likely to have banks competing fiercely for the business and may be able to negotiate terms. In 2014, for example, China’s Alibaba paid 1.2 per cent when it raised $25bn in the largest ever IPO. Visa, the payments company, paid 2.8 per cent on a 2008 deal that raised almost $20bn. Facebook’s fees in 2012 were 1.1 per cent for a $16bn IPO. With a rush of large tech “unicorns” — companies valued at least $1bn in private markets — and “decacorns,” valued at $10bn or more, the maths point to a big haul for banks this year. Consider Lyft. The company raised more than $2.5bn, paying underwriters 2.75 per cent, or $70m, including an overallotment option, according to Dealogic. Pinterest, which raised $1.6bn, had a fee of 4 per cent, or $66m. The fee pool is not evenly distributed among the group of underwriters which, in Lyft’s case, included 29 banks. That increases pressure on bankers to land the top spots on the very biggest offerings. The two or three banks that lead the deal are allotted more shares to sell and they work more closely with corporate executives to usher the company through the IPO process, so take more of the pot. For the Lyft deal, lead managers JPMorgan and Credit Suisse took in $23m and $19m, respectively, in total underwriting fees, on Dealogic figures. On Pinterest, top banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Allen & Co made about $21m, $20m and $8m, respectively. Uber is this year’s really mega-deal. The company said on Friday that it plans to raise as much as $8.5bn at the midpoint of its price range of $44 to $50 a share, before the overallotment option. Even a fee of 1.5 per cent would bring in about $128m for a single deal. Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as lead underwriters, should take the lion’s share. As the world waits to see if the next Microsoft or Amazon is among the rush of IPOs this year and next, and newly minted companies turn their attention to delivering on their IPO pitches, Wall Street will not much care. It will have already booked its gains. nicole.bullock@ft.com

"Does capitalism need saving from itself?","Gillian Tett on why bosses are buying into the idea of a purpose beyond profit","© Illustration by Graham Tuckwell Marty Lipton does not have the look of an American revolutionary. At the age of 88, he is seldom seen without a carefully pressed suit and dapper tie.  His resume reeks of Wall Street power. In 1965 he co-founded Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, one of the most prestigious and lucrative American corporate law groups, and he is famous for having invented, in 1982, the “poison pill” — a legal mechanism used by company boards to prevent takeovers. “I believe in capitalism. I believe in our [financial] system,” Lipton tells me over lunch in the Rockefeller Center Club, an elite venue on the 65th floor of the Rockefeller Center, where Manhattan power brokers can dine while peering down on the teeming city below. But it is from elevated perches such as this that Lipton has been waging a decades-long battle with parts of America’s establishment. The reason is a paper he wrote in 1979 called “Takeover Bids in the Target’s Boardroom”, which floated a then-revolutionary idea: that corporate leaders and investors should stop focusing on short-term shareholder returns and instead chase long-term value for “stakeholders” such as employees, clients and communities. In continental Europe or Japan, which have long embraced a more stakeholder-focused model of capitalism, Lipton’s idea might not have seemed so controversial. Yet in the US his paper provoked trenchant attacks from other lawyers, academics and investors. “Nobody wanted to listen,” Lipton chuckles over the Rockefeller silverware. But history can move in unexpected ways. Last month, 181 American chief executives issued a collective “statement on the purpose of a corporation” that abandoned their long adherence to shareholder primacy. Instead, the group — which was organised by the Business Roundtable under the leadership of Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan — pledged “a fundamental commitment to all our stakeholders”. Marty Lipton in his New York law office in 2016. His once controversial views on corporate responsibility are gaining wider acceptance © Sasha Maslov/New York Times/Eyevine That move delighted social and environmental activists. However, it infuriated some economists and investors, who declared that companies would be tossed into legal confusion. Rightwing pundits accused the Business Roundtable of shattering America’s vision of free-market capitalism, while on the left politicians such as Bernie Sanders accused the executives of hypocrisy, given their sky-high levels of pay.  The battle leaves many questions hanging. Why is the American establishment questioning capitalism now? Could Wall Street ever really embrace Lipton’s once-heretical vision? And if it did, what would this mean for growth, and for the current wave of populism? “I put forward my ideas of stakeholders to save capitalism — not destroy it,” Lipton explains. “But if we don’t act now, I don’t think that capitalism will be around in the next 50 years.”  If you want to understand what is at stake in this debate, it pays to ponder the original meaning of the word “company”. Today, this invokes images of balance sheets and profit margins. However, “company” actually arises from the 12-century French word compagnie, a “society, friendship, intimacy; body of soldiers”, which hails from the Late Latin phrase companio: “one who eats bread with you”. Commerce, in other words, was initially synonymous with social ties. That original meaning remained in place for centuries. Thus when Adam Smith, the 18th-century Scottish intellectual, wrote his treatises on the “hidden hand” he saw no contradiction between The Wealth of Nations (about markets) and The Theory of Moral Sentiments (about moral philosophy). In the 20th century, however, the meaning of “company” changed. The reason was a man who has been Lipton’s nemesis: the Nobel Prize-winning economics professor Milton Friedman. In 1962, Friedman published a book, Capitalism and Freedom, which argued that a company had no “social responsibility” to the public or society, but only to its shareholders. Or as he explained in a 1970s essay: “In a free-enterprise, private-property system, a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business . . . his primary responsibility is to them.”  The essay sparked a wider revolution. In politics, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher used advice from Friedman to launch radical free-market policies. In the corporate sphere, US and UK boards stopped assuming that companies should invest revenues into their business (which had been the C-suite mantra in the early 20th century) and started focusing on dividend payments to shareholders. In universities, economists such as Eugene Fama declared that free markets were the only valid engine of growth and value, while law professors such as Lucian Bebchuk insisted corporate boards had no right to ever overrule investors, however short-term their focus.  On Wall Street, a new army of financiers, lawyers and consultants seized on the new paradigm to create booming businesses managing equities, as a new pension and mutual fund sector emerged. Then a wave of hostile company takeovers and raids got under way, as financiers scooped up the shares of weak companies to extract value. These raiders operated under the flag of Friedman — and Smith, who would probably have been turning in his grave.  In January 1979, American Express launched a hostile $880m bid for McGraw Hill, the information conglomerate. Lipton was hired to defend McGraw Hill.  It was a defining moment for Wall Street — and Lipton’s career. He had been born, in Depression-era 1931, into a modest New Jersey family, and when he co-founded his legal practice he seemed poorly placed to shake up Wall Street. But he found a niche advising companies dealing with raiders. That was in part a canny business decision, but Lipton also liked to present himself as the defender of old-fashioned business values: even today Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz hires its staff “on a handshake” and operates from one office with a mere 270-odd lawyers, who always eat lunch together every Tuesday. It has a flat pay structure by Wall Street standards, albeit with remuneration reportedly averaging well over $5m per partner. “Money is not the reason people work here,” Lipton sometimes says. Economics professor Milton Friedman, on the balcony of his San Francisco home in 1986. Friedman argued that executives' primary responsibility was to their shareholders © Getty When Lipton looked at American Express’s hostile bid back in 1979, however, he knew that money did matter. Since the Amex bid offered shareholders a fat, immediate gain, Friedman’s creed implied that shareholders should accept it. But the McGraw Hill board insisted it would smash the long-term value of the company. So was there any way to stop this? Lipton decided his best route was to attack Friedman directly. In “Takeover Bids”, he asked whether “the long-term interests of the nation’s corporate system and economy should be jeopardised in order to benefit speculators interested not in the vitality and continued existence of the business enterprise in which they have bought shares, but only in a quick profit on the sale of those shares?” Amex eventually dropped the bid, and in 1985 the Delaware court — which shapes American corporate finance since so many companies are based in the state — issued rulings on cases involving Unocal and Household International that partly supported Lipton’s stance. But any sense of victory was shortlived. The Delaware court made a ruling linked to Revlon that upheld shareholder primacy, and in 1992 the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced rules that reinforced shareholder activists. More important still, institutional investors started to outsource their voting decisions to specialist proxy services whose only mandate was to maximise shareholder returns. In 1994, pension industry reforms further entrenched the idea of shareholder primacy. Shareholder rights are essential for keeping managers and directors accountableLucian Bebchuk, law professor Thus by the start of the 21st century, the concept of shareholder primacy seemed ever more entrenched. Lipton’s critics dismissed his crusade as just a self-interested marketing stance and insisted that his desire to defend corporate leaders over all matters — even with their sky-high pay — was undemocratic. “Shareholder rights are essential for keeping managers and directors accountable,” insists Bebchuk, who often exchanged bitter words with Lipton. Moreover, the Friedman camp appeared to have history on its side: America’s vision of capitalism had not only triumphed over Soviet socialism, but it had also unleashed much stronger growth than Japan and continental Europe, which respected stakeholders more. Yet as so often in history, the Friedman doctrine’s moment of triumph was when the seeds of doubt were sown. These years saw the eruption of a wild financial boom, driven by cheap credit, deregulation, dealmaking and faith that free markets would solve all problems. The sheer exuberance of the markets left some uneasy, even on Wall Street. Take the story of Jay Coen Gilbert, Bart Houlahan and Andrew Kassoy. In the 1990s, Gilbert co-founded a basketball apparel company called AND1, which was sold for a hefty sum to American Sporting Goods in 2005. It seemed a classic example of American capitalist success. But Gilbert was horrified to see that once the deal was done, the new owners restructured the company to make quick returns, hurting its long-term strategy.  Could this have been prevented, he wondered? Not under Delaware law, it seemed. Gilbert teamed up with Houlahan and Kassoy to float a novel idea: why not create a new legal structure to protect stakeholders? “We wanted to redefine the company,” Kassoy says. In 2006 they launched this new legal structure, dubbed a “Benefit Corporation” — or “B Corp” — with the authorisation of the Delaware courts, creating a legal framework for companies that requires managers to not just chase financial metrics (for shareholders) but environmental and social goals too. It seemed terrible timing. During the credit boom few company executives wanted to change the status quo. And after that bubble burst in 2008, even fewer had the energy to fret about legal structures.  But by 2010 Kassoy was noticing something odd: though relatively few large companies actually turned themselves into B Corps, many started to embrace B Corp metrics to assess their performance around non-monetary factors. “Companies suddenly woke up and looked at how they measured themselves,” Kassoy recalls. Why? One reason was that the 2008 financial crisis had undermined faith in unfettered free markets. Another was that companies and investors were starting to realise that environmental risks could have an impact on their operations and portfolios. However, a third factor was politics: the 2008 crisis had unleashed a popular anger against America’s corporate and political elite. And while most executives initially assumed that this anger would die away when the recession ended, the reverse occurred: even after recovery resumed, resentment grew.   Some of this anger was focused on issues such as immigration and globalisation (later stoked by politicians such as Donald Trump.) However, chief executives could sense that they were vulnerable too. Data were emerging that showed that decades of shareholder primacy had — unsurprisingly — left labour losing out badly to capital (ie investors) and executives. By 2007 chief executive pay was 345.9 times that of the average worker, up from a ratio of 29.7 in 1978 — and labour’s share in the overall economic output in America (ie wages) had fallen steadily over the same period, even as corporate profits boomed. Meanwhile, payouts to investors soared: today dividend payouts and net equity issues at companies are worth almost 100 per cent of after-tax profits; in 1972 these payouts were just 24 per cent, since spare cash was being invested or paid to workers.  Nobody had fretted about this during the boom. But the 2008 crisis had prompted a reappraisal of the American success story: in 2017 a poll suggested that 44 per cent of millennials preferred socialism to capitalism. Wall Street executives and financiers scrambled for ways to defend themselves. Lynn Rothschild, a former telecoms executive married to a scion of the European banking lineage, was a case in point. In 2014 she created a forum called “Inclusive Capitalism”, with a roster of luminaries — ranging from Prince Charles to Steve Schwarzman to Christine Lagarde — to champion a vision of business based around stakeholders. A decade earlier, that title might have seemed like a contradiction in terms. But Rothschild joined forces with Ernst & Young, and won support from asset managers with $30tn behind them. “The people saying the system is broken are not wrong,” Rothschild explains. “If we don’t have [inclusive capitalism], we can surely expect capitalism to be replaced with something far worse.”  Lynn Rothschild, left, talks to Prince Charles and Christine Lagarde before the start of the 'Inclusive Capitalism' conference in London in 2014 © Getty Other initiatives — bearing pious names such as “The CEO Force For Good” — emerged too. Then another factor started change the zeitgeist: it became increasingly clear that climate change could wreak havoc on some company operations, and investor portfolios, in the long term. In January 2018, Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, declared that to “prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society . . . [and] benefit all of their stakeholders”. Leftwing critics cried hypocrisy and some investors pointed out that BlackRock itself had contributed to the crisis of capitalism since it had promoted passive funds (or computer-driven investing). However, the sheer size of BlackRock made it hard for other investors to ignore the trend. “Suddenly everyone was saying capitalism had failed,” recalls one Wall Street chief executive. “We started worrying about pitchforks.”  These days, when Lipton ponders the state of the corporate world, he feels partly vindicated. “The Business Roundtable memo is a real turning point,” he enthuses. What makes him equally excited is the explosion in financial and business activity that supports environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. This idea is certainly not new: socially minded investors (such as nuns or Swedish pension funds) have long used finance to promote social good. But in recent years ESG has moved from being a tiny cottage industry into a mainstream endeavour worth $31tn, according to the broadest definitions. Critics claim that much of this ESG business is so dangerously ill-defined, fragmented and opaque that it conceals a multitude of ethical sins. Optimists retort that these criticisms were found in the early phases of other waves of financial innovation too, until those sectors matured. “The situation with ESG looks similar to what I saw in the early days of leveraged finance,” says Marisa Drew, chief executive officer of the impact advisory and finance department at Credit Suisse. Either way, just as an army of accountants and lawyers once scrambled to turn the Friedman doctrine into a business plan — and fat fees — a race is now on to create a more professional framework for ESG too. “We are finding ways to measure stakeholder issues in accounts,” enthuses Ronald Cohen, a luminary of British venture capital, who is working with Harvard academics to overhaul accounting systems. Suddenly everyone was saying capitalism had failed. We started worrying about pitchforksAnonymous Wall Street chief executive Yet even amid this apparent “success”, Lipton remains worried about a backlash. The Council of Institutional Investors, for example, lambasted the Business Roundtable memo, warning that “accountability to everyone means accountability to no one”. Luigi Zingales, a Chicago economics professor, dismissed it too as “at best misleading marketing, at worst a dangerous power grab” by overconfident chief executives. Moreover, while few in business will publicly criticise the Roundtable, some fear it will lead to more regulation by government. “It’s ridiculous — this is not how capitalism is supposed to work,” one prominent chief executive argues. More worrying still, in Lipton’s eyes, is the risk that leftwing politicians could go much further. In the UK, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn recently proposed an “Inclusive Ownership Fund” to give workers mandatory stakes in big companies. American figures such as Elizabeth Warren are also pushing for a pro-worker corporate overhaul, and for Lipton the lessons are clear. “The failure to recognise the existential threats of inequality and climate change, not only to business corporations but also asset managers, institutional investors and all shareholders, will invariably lead to legislation that will regulate not only corporations but also investors,” Lipton recently wrote to the CII. “Shareholder primacy was ill-conceived in the first place . . . The alternative is state corporatism in the form of legislation such as Senator Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act.” Friedmanites — and the CII — disagree: in their eyes it is Lipton who is undermining capitalism. Meanwhile, critics such as Warren might dismiss the battle as just an inward-looking elite fight that excludes workers. But either way, the one thing that is crystal clear is that there will not be a resolution anytime soon. “I am going to keep fighting for the rest of my life,” Lipton chuckles.

"The painful path to curing Japan of its cash addiction","A switch to electronic payments could save up to $15bn a year, but mistrust is hindering change"," In early July, the 61-year-old chief executive of 7pay appeared on TV to apologise after the launch of one of Japan’s most hotly anticipated mobile payment services had turned into a catastrophe. After struggling to explain why his cashless system — rolled out across the company’s 21,000-strong network of 7-Eleven stores to 1.5m users — had been hacked and defrauded within hours of going live, Tsuyoshi Kobayashi was asked about the standard safeguard of “two-step authentication”.  In response, Mr Kobayashi slowly repeated the phrase in the befuddled tones of someone hearing it for the first time, telling the nation all it needed to know. The incident has become part of a grand parable of modern Japan: a country in a permanent tension between its high-tech image and the realities of ageing consumers and squandered opportunities. Japan invented two of the key cashless technologies that other countries have deployed to leap ahead of it. And while its ambition of turning one of the world’s most cash-obsessed societies into one of the least by June 2027 may be real, so too are the management ineptitudes, extreme market overcrowding, structural obstacles and demographics that stand in their way. A customer swipes a smart card to pay for items at an unmanned cash register at a FamilyMart convenience store in Tokyo © Bloomberg Over the past couple of years, both the Japanese government and its corporations have laid out plans for this revolution — one that could fundamentally reshape and revitalise the world’s third-largest economy and even, say some, help Japan’s decades-long battle with deflation. Foremost among these plans is the government’s “cashless vision” of doubling the ratio of card and e-money transactions from their current low levels within the next eight years, to create a $1tn-plus cashless market. Heading the drive is Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as his government looks to capitalise on an expected surge in tourists ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and a sales tax increase in October that they hope will encourage retailers to replace labour-intensive cash transactions with more efficient digital payment systems. 
 A significant factor behind the push is Japan’s shrinking working-age population — a limited resource that can no longer be wasted on labour intensive processes involved in the handling of cash. Another is raw economics: Nomura Research Institute estimates that it costs the country about $15bn every year to handle the cash it uses: expenditure that could be better deployed elsewhere.  Analysts at UBS, who believe that around 40 per cent of payments in the country will be non-cash by 2026, say Japan is approaching a tipping point. Banks have begun to sharply reduce their networks of ATMs to cut costs. Although seen in other countries, it is a phenomenon more pronounced in Japan, say analysts, due to a chronic labour shortage that is already reverberating through the retail and restaurant sectors. “Digitalisation is spreading at an incredible pace so it’s important that we do not remain satisfied with the status quo and take active steps to address these structural changes,” says Tatsufumi Sakai, chief executive of Mizuho Financial Group, which recently launched a digital currency service and laid out plans to shut about 20 per cent of its 500-branch network. One byproduct, says Hiromichi Shirakawa, a strategist at Credit Suisse, is that greater use of digital settlements should reduce “menu costs” — achieving a long-hoped-for ambition of the Bank of Japan, the central bank, to make prices less rigid and boost inflation.  The ¥1,000 note has anchored the price of lunch deals in Japan for years despite fluctuations in input prices © Getty Mr Shirakawa cites the strange tyranny of the ¥1,000 note which has anchored the price of lunch deals in Japan for years despite fluctuations in input prices. “Increased adoption of cashless settlement technologies should enable retailers to adjust their output prices more frequently . . . rather than remaining ‘constrained’ by the ¥1,000 unit,” wrote Mr Shirakawa. This shift is happening against a backdrop of acute concern over national prestige. When Japan hosted the Olympics in 1964, it wowed the world with its technology; it wants to do the same next year and fears the humiliation of visitors discovering that Japan still has large food retailers, medical clinics, restaurants and hotels that only accept cash.
 “It was my first time so I was very nervous but what a relief that it was so easy,” Mr Abe wrote on Twitter in February with a photo of him awkwardly holding an iPad to scan a QR code to pay for flowers. “We hope to dramatically expand cashless in Japan . . . in preparation for an era with 40m foreign tourists [up from 31m in 2018].” Despite such ambitions, the amount of cash in circulation in Japan has actually risen over the past 20 years. And, according to figures released by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 2018, Japan’s ratio of cashless transactions to total household consumption was far below that of other big economies at 18 per cent. South Korea was close to 90 per cent, the UK was more than 55 per cent and the US more than 45 per cent. Only Germany among the major economies has a lower ratio of cashless transactions at 15 per cent. Missed opportunities: FeliCa
 © AP In 1988, Sony began development of its FeliCa technology, an early form of the near-field communication technology that will later be used by Apple Pay. FeliCa chips were used to create Octopus smart cards in Hong Kong in 1997, but it became mainstream in Japan only after NTT DoCoMo introduced phones dubbed osaifu-keitai, or mobile wallets, running on the FeliCa technology in 2004. Since then, the system has become embedded in daily routines from public transport to unlocking doors.  Japan’s deeply ingrained addiction to cash, say analysts, stems in part from a fundamental mistrust of financial systems. Low crime rates also contribute, meaning people are happy to carry large quantities of money with them. This has stunted the spread of cashless systems that have taken hold elsewhere in the world even though the technology behind them was often pioneered in Japan. When 7pay launched its abortive digital payment system, it joined a long list of cashless systems using the QR code — a technology developed a quarter of a century ago as a means of tracking components in the Toyota supply chain. Other Japanese technologies, including Sony’s FeliCa system of contactless payments, were adopted in places such as Hong Kong for its Octopus travel card years before they became mainstream in Japan. So when PayPay, a joint venture between SoftBank and Yahoo Japan, launched in October, the underlying technology came from India’s biggest mobile payments company, Paytm. “It’s crazy for an Indian company that we can bring [to] Japan what they invented,” says Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Paytm’s founder. “The technology, aggression and resources is the reason for PayPay’s success.” Tsuyoshi Kobayashi, 7pay president, attends a press conference to apologise following the 7pay security breach © Getty The threat from cyber security had already cast a pall over the nascent industry well before the 7pay fiasco. When PayPay launched a generous 20 per cent cashback campaign in December to advertise its new mobile payment service, it quickly received complaints from some users who were charged for purchases they never made. It has since rolled out several measures to prevent credit card fraud. Yet the incentives for business to go cashless are enormous. Nomura Research Institute estimates that the biggest portion of Japan’s $15bn in annual costs of handling cash is due to rising labour costs, while another broader estimate by Mizuho Financial Group that includes one-off costs puts the figure as high as ¥8tn ($74bn). On the positive side, if a store goes cashless, that is estimated to boost the number of customers on average by 2.1 per cent and per-customer sales by 1.6 per cent, according to the think-tank. Encouraged by such numbers, Royal Holdings, which operates Royal Host and Sizzler restaurants in Japan, has been experimenting with a cashless store in central Tokyo since the end of 2017. There has been a drastic reduction in the amount of time store managers spend handling cash. And the store is attracting five times more applications for jobs than other outlets of similar size in Tokyo.  But the company is not closing the door on cash. “Customers should also have the option of using cash,” says a spokeswoman. “So our general direction is to not to get rid of cash, but to reduce labour linked to managing cash.” The dilemma for companies is that whatever the obstacles, none of them want to be left out of the cashless boom. As a result, consumers are left with too many options to choose from. “This is typical of Japan Inc. Whenever there is a boom, everyone enters and as a result, things end up being ramshackle,” says Masanori Kusunoki, a visiting professor and cyber security expert at the International University of Japan.  Technology groups such as Line, the messaging app, Rakuten, the ecommerce group that sponsors Barcelona and Origami, the mobile payment start-up, entered the market for QR code mobile payment services as early as 2014. The past 12 months has seen an influx of bigger traditional players including Japan’s three largest mobile carriers — NTT DoCoMo, SoftBank and KDDI — and retailers such as Seven & I and FamilyMart Uny Holdings. Shinzo Abe visits a shopping arcade in Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward in February as part of a campaign to promote cashless shopping in Japan © Getty So far, there has been no clear winner, although PayPay has been the fastest growing service with more than 8m registered users in less than a year. A February survey by research firm MyVoice Communications, found 20 per cent of the people surveyed said they had used smartphone payment services during the past year. Of those people, 4.9 per cent used Rakuten Pay, followed by 3.8 per cent for PayPay, 3.3 per cent for Apple Pay and 3.1 per cent for Line Pay. Despite the competitive market, industry executives say it is not the flood of rivals — with even global tech giants Apple and Amazon struggling to make significant headway in Japan — but the challenge of dismantling the “cash is king” mentality that poses the biggest obstacle. Hard cash is still the reassuring choice for many Japanese, especially for the 30 per cent of the population expected to be over 65 by 2025. 

 A separate luminance colour camera at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympic games in Tokyo in 1964 © Getty “We’re not really at the stage of worrying about our competitors,” says Shigenobu Kobayashi, executive officer at Rakuten Payment. “Our biggest enemy is cash. Despite the plethora of other payment options out there, cash remains dominant and that’s an endless challenge for us.” To break that addiction, says Youngsu Ko, chief executive of Line Pay, it will not be enough to just prove that mobile payments are safe and convenient. Users also need economic incentives. “Line Pay needs to ensure the security, reliability and familiarity that cash offers, but we also need to offer something [more],” Mr Ko says. “If we want to change the user experience that’s based on cash, we have to continue offering benefits until people feel Line Pay is better than cash.” Similar to campaigns launched by rivals, Line is offering a three-year no-charge campaign to small and medium-sized retailers to reduce the financial stress of switching to a cashless system. Eventually, it hopes to convince store owners that additional costs of transactions through Line Pay, which has 36m registered users in Japan, will be offset by a boost in sales. At Rakuten, Mr Kobayashi says the key to unlocking the cashless potential is Japan’s love for loyalty points, which is estimated to account for roughly 30 per cent of the country’s consumer spending. The group, which also offers online banking, mobile phone and credit card services, wants to create a system where loyalty points from its cashless payment services will help boost spending at more than 3m stores already signed up to use the technologies. Missed opportunities: QR codes
 © Bloomberg A division of Toyota supplier Denso invented the Quick Response (QR) code in 1994 following a request from users of its barcode readers to develop an equivalent that could hold more information. The QR codes were quickly adopted by the Japanese automotive industry to help with tracking vehicles and components during the manufacturing process. But Japan was slower, compared with China, to apply two-dimensional QR bar codes for mobile payments, which became the dominant payment method in Chinese stores from about five years ago.  The government is bolstering these efforts by offering points that can be exchanged for future discounts for those consumers using 
cashless payment systems for nine months after the consumption tax is raised, from 8 to 10 per cent, in October. The incentives, which also include covering part of the costs for retailers to go cashless, will be paid for with a $2.6bn budget. 
 Executives admit temporary cashback and no-fee campaigns can only go so far. Ultimately, consumers and retailers need to be convinced that they are better off, longer-term, going cashless.  Japan is notorious for its technologies falling into the so-called Galápagos trap where the country evolves its own ecosystem, insulated from the rest of the world. “How much the cashless trend will spread to stores and consumers over the next nine months will be critical,” says Daisuke Tanaka, senior consultant at Nomura Research Institute. “There is no doubt Japan will generally shift towards cashless but things will be chaotic for some time.” ","23.07.2019"
"Forget the backdrop, now really is a good time to invest","Be wary of US equities — but China and the UK offer more potential","Valuations are high. The geopolitical situation is volatile. Monetary policy is hitting a multi-decade turning point. Global growth is slowing.  It’s a little bit scary. You’ll get no argument from me on any of that. You will, however, get some on the logical conclusion you might draw from it: that it isn’t a good time to invest. If you are in for the really long term — say, in your twenties now and saving for retirement — any time is a good time to invest. If you are in for the medium or even the short term, while you can’t shove money into the market in the same blanket way as a 25-year-old, there is always value somewhere.  Credit Suisse has just released its Global Investment Returns Yearbook, which contains an insane amount of data. The key takeaway for the investor has to be long-term returns: 6.4 per cent a year for the US, as measured over the past 119 years, and 4.2 per cent on average for the world excluding the US; 6.4 per cent is great, 4.2 per cent is pretty good too.  So if you are thinking about your Isa this week, what should you put in your new wrapper? The first part of the answer lies in the US, which makes up 53 per cent of the global stock market. You have to be wary of US equities, for the simple reason that they are expensive on any measure you use. If the returns you make in the future are a direct function of the price you pay today (they are, no arguing on this one please), that matters.  You will be told over and over that you should never bet against the US — it has always traded at a premium to everywhere else and, thanks to its business-friendly, start-up-supportive environment, good corporate governance, high level of business concentration (plus the high margins that brings) and dedication to property rights, the rule of law and democracy, it always will. I’ll give the cheerleaders the second bit of this: all these things do make the US attractive. It is hard to imagine its stock market being shut down and delivering a 100 per cent loss to its investors, in Chinese or Russian-style, for example. But I can’t give ground on the first part.  The US has not always traded at a huge premium to the rest of the world and it hasn’t always delivered the best returns. Over the 119 years in question, the Credit Suisse yearbook suggests it has been matched by Sweden and beaten by Australia and South Africa.  Since diversification is all, you should have exposure to the US, but do take it carefully. I’d look at the Arbrook/G10 American Equities Fund, which looks beyond basic valuations to find “latency”, or mispriced potential that can be unlocked by the right management in listed companies. The fund was launched at rather a difficult time at the end of 2017 but is still doing fine, up a little more than the S&P 500 since launch and 13.6 per cent so far in 2019. Also of interest is the Blue Whale Growth Fund, seeded by Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of Hargreaves Lansdown, to run some of his not inconsiderable fortune. It’s global, but currently 64 per cent invested in the US and up 22 per cent since its 2017 launch. The MSCI World Index is up 7 per cent. You will also need some emerging markets exposure. Again, this is not straightforward. Of course, you want to hold equities in places where the middle classes are developing and the scope for rapid growth is huge. But, as shown by the dismal year emerging markets had in 2018, there are two issues here. The first is that these markets are heavily influenced by China. When growth falls there, many of them suffer.  The second is that the diversification benefits of the bigger emerging markets aren’t what they were. As the yearbook points out: “Today’s emerging markets are mostly dominated by larger global companies. Much of their revenues and profits come from abroad and their fortunes are closely linked to other global equities.”  This increased “interconnectedness” can also be noted in the fact that the big companies listed in developed markets have major operations in emerging markets. If you are going to diversify, attempting to do so by holding global companies listed in different places isn’t going to do the job for you.  Yet emerging markets are already up 9 per cent on the year. If we see a trade peace deal between the US and China, a stabilisation of China’s growth rate and more mutterings from the Federal Reserve about pulling back from quantitative tightening — the reversal of quantitative easing — they could have a fabulous 2019. As emerging markets are in large part about China anyway, try Fidelity China Special Situations. This brings me to Europe and in particular to the UK, one of the cheaper markets in the world. Brexit aside, this is odd given that Britain has most of the same attributes as the US.  The value effect has been dull of late as the years since 2007 have been all about growth. So have the small-cap effects. But both are showing signs of returningMerryn Somerset Webb The yearbook has a good look at what types of stocks work best for long-term investors. Every year the conclusions are similar: small companies and value stocks do best. In the UK, £1 invested in 1955 in value stocks, defined as the 40 per cent in the market with the lowest book-to-market ratio, would now be worth more than 20 times the amount generated by £1 placed in growth stocks.  The small-cap effect is even more interesting. £1 in large-caps in 1955 would have been worth £1,112 by the end of 2018. £1 in small-caps would have been worth £6,941 and £1 in micro-caps a rather lovely £28,833. Now you’re talking real returns.  The value effect has been dull of late as the years since 2007 have been all about growth. So have the small-cap effects (everyone loves a multinational). But both are showing signs of returning.  With that in mind, have a look at the Aurora Investment Trust, one of my own investments. It’s small, with a market capitalisation of £116m, concentrated, with only 10 to 20 holdings and value orientated, the idea being to buy stocks when they are trading at 50 per cent or more below the manager’s idea of their “intrinsic” value.  On the small-cap side, history suggests you might as well go micro (with a small part of your portfolio): the Miton UK MicroCap Trust is another element in my investment line-up.  The funds mentioned above are not going to make up a fully balanced portfolio. You might want to make that part easier by buying a few all-round multi-asset funds such as — another of my holdings — the Personal Assets Trust, which has a good 10 per cent of its assets in gold. Another worth looking at is the McInroy & Wood Balanced Fund. Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek. Views are personal. merryn@ft.com. Twitter: @MerrynSW

"Stocks to watch: BASF, IP Group, Adecco, Smurfit, Just Eat, Croda","Europe’s slowdown leaves staffing companies exposed, says Goldman Sachs","Tuesday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● BASF hit a three-year low after a profit warning, its second in seven months. The German chemicals maker said full-year earnings would be much lower than expected because of automotive weakness, a weak crop planting season in North America and unresolved US-China trade friction. Hopes of a second-half recovery looked unsupported, it said.  Full-year earnings before tax and one-offs would be as much as 30 per cent below the prior year level, versus previous guidance of a slight increase, BASF warned. Consensus expectations had already anticipated a warning, but were only assuming a 7 per cent year-on-year earnings decline. For the second quarter BASF said core earnings would be just €1bn, down 47 per cent year on year.  The magnitude of deterioration within three months “shows that the BASF business model offers no obvious benefit from being almost everything to everybody in the sector”, said JPMorgan Cazenove, which downgraded the stock to “neutral”.  “We see this as a further argument for the company to seriously consider optimising and simplifying the portfolio. Prior to the warning, we had been of the opinion that one should be a buyer of this expected profit warning. However, given the magnitude of cuts to estimates, our view that there now seems to be no easy way out of this earnings malaise — partly symptomatic of a business model that has failed to inspire confidence in recent times — and the rising dividend sustainability risk are enough reasons for us to rescind our optimism for now.”JPMorgan HSBC, also downgrading BASF to “hold” from “buy”, said management’s credibility was dented by the severity of the reset. “Profits have collapsed, and it’s not even a recession,” it said. A commitment to maintain a progressive dividend was realistic based on cash flow but “offers scant comfort from a valuation standpoint”. “Every conversation that we’ve had with the company over the last few months has centred on the outlook, and there is no question that the assumptions inherent in the guidance were clearly stated and that excuses are readily available — eg trade war resolution, Brexit, weaker-than-expected industrial production growth. However, we think there is a line between financial guidance using optimistic assumptions and guidance that uses aspirational assumptions. The latter has fairly limited utility or credibility, in our view.”HSBC BASF’s chemical sector peers including Covestro and Croda, along with industrial engineers such as Bodycote, Melrose and RHI Magnesita, all traded sharply lower. ● Ocado rallied to the top of the FTSE 100 gainers after leaving underlying earnings guidance unchanged, in spite of increased operating costs to support new business wins. Nevertheless, the grocery delivery specialist more than halved its full-year earnings target by booking £25m of cash-neutral charges, which were to cover a fire at its Andover warehouse and share price strength inflating the cost of employee bonuses.  Ocado’s headline profit for the half year was well below forecasts, due largely to share compensation costs, but was broadly in line with consensus expectations on an underlying basis. Bulls on the stock pointed to Ocado’s success growing licensing fees to explain the stock’s strength. “As it pushes through to becoming The Microsoft of Retail, Ocado’s fees from its deals increased by 36 per cent in the first half 2019 to £123m, with international fees almost doubling. This is the key performance indicator that investors should focus on as Ocado makes the dramatic transformation from a transactional online retailer to a software and deep tech hardware business.”Peel Hunt Traders also suggested short covering. Shares on loan to short sellers had risen to nearly 5 per cent of Ocado’s equity, from just over 1 per cent a month ago, Markit data show.  ● IP Group dropped after a regulatory filing showed cornerstone investor Woodford Investment Management had cut its stake in the intellectual property developer to 13.41 per cent, from 14.08 per cent previously.  Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs downgraded staffing companies Adecco 
and Randstad to “sell” from “buy” with price target of SFr51 and €45 respectively. “While first-quarter results showed a stabilisation of growth trends, recent macro and staffing datapoints have taken a turn for the worse, especially in Europe where Adecco and Randstad generate the majority of their revenues. Hence, we expect organic growth to weaken further and remain in negative territory near term. We lower our estimates for both Adecco and Randstad and expect them to see negative organic growth for the next two quarters before stabilising.”Goldman Europe provided 55 per cent of revenue last year for Adecco and 70 per cent for Randstad and their organic growth historically has been strongly correlated with GDP, said Goldman. Its price targets were based on the last time the companies saw organic revenue turn negative, in 2012, when the stocks were valued at around 11 times forward earnings. ● Berenberg downgraded Just Eat, the takeaway ordering website, to “hold” from “buy” with a 600p target. “The Just Eat equity story is now a far cry from the clean winner takes all narrative it once was. Today, in order to continue to push Just Eat as an investment we must either believe that: a) competitors such as Deliveroo and Uber will be rational; or b) there is an imminent break-up story set to crystallise significant value. Unfortunately, at this time, we are yet to be convinced on either: Uber’s IPO and Amazon’s recent backing of Deliveroo (subject to approval) suggests competition is likely to get tougher rather than easier, and we question whether Just Eat’s board will approve the disposal of its best assets during the investment phase.”Berenberg ● Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Smurfit Kappa to “outperform” from “neutral” and repeated “outperform” advice on Mondi. The cardboard box makers were worth buying ahead of half-year results as containerboard prices look to have stabilised, with room for packaging demand to improve in the second half, it said.

"Opinion today: Why the world economy feels so fragile","Mild slowdown is to be expected given how long the current cyclical upswing has lasted","This article is from today’s FT Opinion email. Sign up to receive a daily digest of the big issues straight to your inbox.

 The momentum of global economic growth slowed significantly in 2018. So how concerned should we be? According to Martin Wolf, a mild slowdown is to be expected given how long the current cyclical upswing has lasted. And, he argues, there is a difference between such a downturn and a full-blown global recession. In normal circumstances, it would be relatively easy to ride it out. But these are not normal circumstances. Long-term structural changes to the global economy have made it more fragile. And these have in turn had profound political effects which make handling even a limited slowdown very tricky. Anne-Marie Slaughter writes that Senator Elizabeth Warren’s declaration as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the US presidency has kick-started a debate among Democrats about the future of American foreign policy. Brooke Masters asks if further trouble is in store for Credit Suisse after three of its former bankers were charged with fraud and bribery in the Mozambican “tuna bonds” scandal. Chloe Cornish finds that Iraqi stockpickers remain optimistic about their country’s future, despite continued violence and political turmoil.

Maybe he is thinking of erecting an “iron curtain”, harking back to Winston Churchill’s use of the terminology when speaking in Fulton, Missouri relating to Stalin’s vision of the separation of communities.
 In response to “We must prepare now for the likelihood of a recession”, ecoview says:  Nobody ‘walks the talk’ on implementing counter cyclical policies. OECD and G20 countries did not start their much needed large infra projects several years ago due to misguided austerity policies.

"Italian family-owned luxury brand Trussardi sells out to fund","Family fashion businesses increasingly offloading stakes amid globalisation pressure","Italian luxury goods brand Trussardi has sold a majority of its shares to QuattroR, an asset management company targeting financially distressed Italian companies for turnround. The sale of Trussardi, which owns a flagship store, restaurant and café on one of Milan’s ritziest areas of real estate, is the latest buyout of an Italian family-owned company. The Trussardi family follows the Versace and Missoni families which last year sold stakes in their closely held businesses. Versace sold a majority stake to Michael Kors group and Missoni a minority stake to Italian private equity company FSi. The families behind Salvatore Ferragamo and Tod’s are being closely watched for signs they may sell their luxury brands as the twin issues of succession and globalisation makes it harder for independent brands to thrive. In Italy too, a worsening political and macro economic environment is also pushing families to sell. The deal, worth €50m, will take place via a NewCo that sees QuattroR taking a stake of about 60 per cent in Trussardi SpA. Tomaso Trussardi, the family scion, will remain chairman, ceding executive powers.  Mr Trussardi said: “I am very pleased that, following the reorganisation of the shareholding structure within my family, an agreement has been finalised today with QuattroR to further enhance the company’s capital structure and business outlook. I am convinced that we have created the best conditions to continue to carry out the project originally developed by my father Nicola”. In a statement, QuattroR, which is run by veteran luxury executive and banker Andrea Morante, formerly of Gucci, Pomellato and Credit Suisse, said it had secured a financial restructuring plan with banks. “QuattroR will provide Trussardi with the economic and financial support needed to implement a new five-year international development plan agreed with Tomaso Trussardi,” it said.  Established in 1911 by Nicolo Trussardi, Trussardi makes around €100m in revenues from its perfumery business and around €150m in revenues from ready to wear and leather goods, according to a person with direct knowledge of the business. It is active in 47 countries through Trussardi, Trussardi Jeans and licensing and has a network of 160 single brand stores in Italy, Europe and Asia, and 1,800 multi brand points of sale. Mr Morante, chairman of QuattroR, said the Trussardi acquisition underlined QuattroR’s mission and vocation to support mid and large Italian corporates in need of financial restructuring.  “The fund’s capital endowment will help support a very interesting and challenging project within an industrial sector of great economic relevance for the country,” he added.","13.02.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Sophos, Tesla, Tiffany, Antofagasta, easyJet, BHP","Cheap credit has left banks comfortably numb to Europe’s slowdown, says Redburn","Friday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● Sophos, the security software maker, slumped after warning of disappointing sales for the second time in three months. Full-year billings were expected to show a “modest decline” at constant currency after third-quarter billings grew just 2 per cent, Sophos warned. That implied billings of around $755m compared with a $791m market consensus, which reflected the previous guidance for modest growth. New customer activity also disappointed with billings sliding in the quarter because of fewer large contracts. With billings forecasts for the 2020 financial year centred at $891m, there is a clear risk of further downgrades, said JPMorgan Cazenove.  ● Tesla dropped after telling employees it would cut its full-time headcount by 7 per cent while increasing production of its Model 3 sedan. Elon Musk, its chief executive, said in a blog post that “the road ahead is very difficult” and that he planned to make “many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months” to allow a price cut for the Model 3 and “still be a viable company”. Mr Musk also flagged that fourth-quarter profit would be “tiny”, which appeared to be in line with a $344m consensus expectation.  “While this news is likely to create more volatility in Tesla shares, when we take a step back and the dust settles, we believe these moves may be viewed as positives to align the business and set up for a more auspicious 2019.”Canaccord Jefferies said the job cuts were not unexpected as Tesla uses productivity improvements to offset a cut to US federal tax credits. “While electric vehicle competition is accelerating, we believe Tesla continues to lead the industry as it moves the Model 3 price point towards $35,000 while most competitors remain engaged in an EV negative-margin sum game at higher price points,” it said. ● Tiffany retreated after reporting flat same-store sales over Christmas at constant currency, which missed market forecasts for 3 per cent growth. The jeweller blamed weaker demand from tourists and local customers, a change from its previous update that only mentioned the former. Management cut the full-year earnings-per-share target “towards the lower end” of its previous range, between $4.65 and $4.80. Initial guidance on 2019 was also cautious with Tiffany edging revenue and earnings expectations lower. JPMorgan estimated that the new targets implied 2019 earnings per share of $4.88 to $4.93 rather than the $5.20 expected by the consensus. Sellside stories ● Redburn upgraded BNP Paribas to “buy” in a sector review that turned positive on the European banks. With lenders seen by investors as leveraged plays on their economies, it may seem counterproductive to turn bullish during a European slowdown, said Redburn. But it added that a flat yield curve is “an anaesthetic to a bank. It dulls the traditional relationship between the industry’s profit cycle and the economic cycle.” Quantitative easing had the side effect of compressing margins “and rendered industry revenues sluggish” during Europe’s 2016 economic acceleration, Redburn said. “But anaesthesia has benefits, and historically cheap debt will shield the sector from the worst of the economic malaise.”  Taking Japan as its example, Redburn forecast European credit growth to prove resilient after decades of reduced supply, while it expected bank impairments to remain at decade lows. With margin side effects starting to abate, a “rare and compelling opportunity has appeared”, it said. “When dividend yields climb above [price-to-earnings] ratios, the market is discounting acute profitability pain. Banks will prove comfortably numb.” Redburn advised buying Crédit Agricole, ING and UniCredit as well as BNP. ● Goldman Sachs downgraded Antofagasta and Norsk Hydro to “sell” in a mining sector review. Though global growth expectations have been tempered over the past year based on slowing demand in China and the US, it is not yet the end of the cycle, particularly as the fall was from a high base and China’s policymakers are taking corrective action to support demand, Goldman said. “Global growth . . . is still sound in absolute terms, ie it implies demand growth that is above supply growth for the majority of commodities. Meanwhile, the lack of tangible capital expenditure on growth projects means that supply growth across the majority of commodities is negligible. As a result, we remain positive on most commodities overall.”Goldman If metals prices fall, mining shares should prove resilient as, compared with previous downturns, their balance sheets are stronger and their returns are higher, said Goldman. It also noted that a US slowdown would weigh on the dollar, which would be positive for commodity producers, and argued that, with the exception of zinc, supply growth remains scarce.  Its top pick in the sector was Anglo American, with the broker also repeating “buy” advice on BHP, Glencore, First Quantum and Lundin. Antofagasta was downgraded on valuation grounds while Norsk was cut to reflect its exposure to aluminium and its problems restarting the Alunorte refinery in Brazil.
 ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded easyJet to “neutral” from “overweight” in a note published ahead of a Ryanair profit warning. The broker argued that while both airlines have similar outlooks and upside potential from depressed valuations, Ryanair’s recent underperformance versus easyJet’s had opened up an opportunity to buy. “Based on its historic and expected financial results we see easyJet as a ‘good’ airline, whereas Ryanair and Wizz Air are ‘very good’. EasyJet currently trades on a [valuation of 10 times 12-month forward earnings], circa 30 per cent discount to its long-term average of circa 14 times. If the UK achieves a soft Brexit (which isn’t guaranteed) then we see meaningful medium-term upside for the shares. However . . . easyJet’s historic valuation discount to Ryanair has largely disappeared, and mean reversion is now likely.”JPMorgan ● In brief: BioPharma Credit cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Boliden raised to “overweight” at Barclays; Ceres Power rated “buy” at Investec; Coats rated “equal-weight” at Barclays; Eni upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; GBL raised to “buy” at Citigroup; Heineken downgraded to “neutral” at Citigroup; Ideagen rated “buy” at Canaccord; Investor AB upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup; K+S raised to “neutral” at Citigroup; Panalpina upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Rexel downgraded to “neutral” at Exane BNP Paribas; RWS Holdings rated “overweight” at Barclays; Sabadell upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Shanta Gold cut to “hold” at Cenkos Securities; Société Générale raised to “neutral” at Citigroup; Sodexo cut to “underperform” at Bernstein.

"Capital raising by US oil companies falls sharply","Exploration and production sector has not had a single bond sale since November","Capital raising by US oil exploration and production companies has fallen sharply following the decline in crude prices that began last October, pointing to cutbacks in capital spending budgets and a continuing slowdown in activity. Companies in the sector have not held a single bond sale since the start of November, according to Dealogic, while share sales have also slowed. The data suggest that after a record-breaking boom in US oil output in 2018, growth will be weaker this year. The government’s Energy Information Administration has forecast that between December 2018 and December 2019, US crude production will rise by about 500,000 barrels a day. That would represent a sharp slowdown from growth of 1.8m b/d over the previous 12 months.  The US shale industry has relied heavily on debt to finance its growth, with exploration and production companies raising about $300bn from bond issuance over the past 10 years.  As crude prices started to slide last October, that source of capital was choked off, with just three bond sales by exploration companies that month, and none at all since November, according to Dealogic.   US benchmark crude dropped from a peak of about $76 a barrel in early October to about $42 at Christmas, before recovering to about $53 this week. Ken Monaghan, co-head of high yield at Amundi Pioneer, the fund management group, said the rise in exploration and production companies’ debt yields had put off potential borrowers, with spreads over US Treasury bonds climbing from 3.9 to 7.5 percentage points at their peak before settling back to about 5.9 percentage points this year. “No one wanted to issue debt unless they had to,” Mr Monaghan said. “At the peak, they would have been looking at yields of about 10.25 per cent. That’s awfully expensive.” Henry Peabody of Eaton Vance, another fund management group, said that for the time being debt and equity investors were aligned in encouraging oil producers to pursue cash generation rather than borrowing more to pursue growth. “No one wants to get caught out over their skis,” he said. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Vicki Hollub, Occidental Petroleum’s chief executive, said US shale oil companies were being forced to react to an investor push for more spending discipline. “Not as much money is going to be pouring into the Permian basin,” she said. John Hess, chief executive of Hess Corporation who was also on the same panel, said shale producers were now contending with a new financial climate. “The investor paradigm is changing.”  Weak share prices have also been a deterrent to capital raising. Share issuance by exploration and production companies has slowed sharply, with just $157m raised from equity sales in the past four months as the S&P oil and gas exploration and production sector index has fallen 29 per cent since October. There has not been an initial public offering of an oil and gas company for more than a year, and companies that were looking at possible flotations are expected to wait for markets to recover. “We have a great IPO backlog, but not much IPO activity,” said Osmar Abib, co-head of energy at Credit Suisse. “We are getting ready, but owners are not going to go out at a substantial discount and give away value.”  With new capital constrained and cash flows squeezed by the weaker crude price, oil production companies are expected to rein in their plans for drilling and completing new wells. The number of rigs drilling oil wells in the US has already dropped by about 8 per cent since November to 889, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. Paal Kibsgaard, chief executive of oilfield services group Schlumberger, told analysts on a call last week that given a steady recovery in US crude prices to last year’s average of about $65 a barrel, it expected investment in onshore exploration and production in the US this year to be “flat to slightly down compared to 2018”. The companies with the greatest access to capital are the big international oil groups, many of which have been building positions in shale oil and projecting steep production growth. Chevron said last month that about a quarter of its planned $20bn capital spending this year would go to the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico and other shale investments.  Merger and acquisition activity in the US exploration and production industry picked up sharply last year, with BP’s $10.5bn purchase of BHP’s shale assets the largest deal, and international oil companies could be buyers again this year, analysts and advisers say. Royal Dutch Shell has been reported to have been looking at buying privately held Endeavor Energy Resources, a leading holder of drilling rights in the Permian Basin. Tim Perry, also of Credit Suisse, said he expected financial pressures to encourage further deals. “Investors want bigger companies, so companies are looking for scale. Larger companies can get their development financed more efficiently,” he said. “There is a general recognition that the industry needs to consolidate.” Additional reporting by Anjli Raval

"Lead investor in Sunrise threatens $6.3bn Swiss telecom deal","Germany’s Freenet owns 25% of Sunrise and opposes funding the deal via a rights issue","Sunrise Communications faces an uphill battle to complete its takeover of Liberty Global’s Swiss network after its largest shareholder said it would oppose a rights issue to fund the $6.3bn takeover.  The Swiss company, which has a market value of SFr3.3bn ($3.3bn), agreed to acquire its rival this week and said it expected to have completed the takeover by the third quarter.  However, the funding mechanism for the deal could prove a high hurdle for it to clear after Freenet, which owns almost a quarter of Sunrise’s shares, said it would not support a SFr4.1bn rights issue to pay for the deal and pay down some existing debt. Sunrise shares slumped to a two-year low after it revealed the deal to buy its rival. The stock closed 9 per cent lower at SFr74.05. Liberty Global opened slightly higher in New York despite the uncertainty around the deal.  Ingo Arnold, chief financial officer of Freenet, said that it was uncomfortable with a sale that required such a vast fundraising but that meant Liberty Global did not share any risk in the execution of the deal.  “A combination of Sunrise and UPC makes a lot of sense to us in principle, as it is supported by compelling industry logic,” he said. “However, the seller does not appear to take on a sufficient share of the risk in the transaction structure recently announced.  “This structure also seems very challenging with regard to the widely announced issue of pre-emptive rights and the voting situation at the required extraordinary general meeting,” he added.  Sunrise needs shareholders representing more than 50 per cent of its stock to back the rights issue.  Mr Arnold said that it could still support a merger of Sunrise and Liberty Global in Switzerland. “It is worth considering whether a merger structure would allow for better risk distribution. Overall, we would be happy to help implement a structure that creates the greatest possible value for all parties. We are not willing to increase our own investment,” he said.  Liberty Global considered acquiring or merging with Sunrise last year but opted instead to sell its own unit.  Freenet, a German company, bought its stake in Sunrise in 2016 but was reported to be looking to sell its holding last year. One person briefed on the situation said that Freenet may support the consolidation of the Swiss telecoms market but it would be unlikely to be able to fund the $1bn needed for it to back the rights issue and retain its stake.  Steve Malcolm, analyst at Redburn, said “This looks a great deal for Liberty shareholders who get cashed out completely from the company’s fast shrinking Swiss unit, but a terrible deal for Sunrise’s shareholders, who end up owning a slower growing, more levered entity at a very high price. “Achieving 50.1 per cent shareholder support to raise 130 per cent of current market cap looks unlikely,” said Mr Malcolm. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by banks, with Deutsche Bank and UBS co-ordinating, and Morgan Stanley is acting as a joint bookrunner. Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and LionTree advised Liberty Global. ","28.02.2019"
"You Wynn some, you lose some","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Wynn Resorts has a lot on its plate right now. Maybe a $7.1bn takeover of Australian billionaire James Packer’s Crown Resorts was too much to handle.  News of Las Vegas-based Wynn’s A$10bn ($7.1bn) bid for the Aussie casino empire leaked early on Tuesday in Sydney. Crown confirmed the story in The Australian Financial Review saying that the two parties were in early talks. Wynn’s offer, comprising half cash and half Wynn stock, would have valued Crown at A$14.75 a share, a premium of 26 per cent over the stock’s closing price on Monday. Crown shares jumped 20 per cent on Tuesday to close at A$14.05. But just as gamblers were waking up in Vegas on Tuesday morning, Wynn called the whole thing off, apparently miffed by the premature disclosure. DD readers might be getting a sense of déjà vu. A potential tie-up between insurance brokers Aon and Willis Towers Watson met a similar fate last month after news emerged that Aon was considering buying its rival. The industry’s number two player was forced to admit it was considering a deal with Willis then changed its mind less than 24 hours later. Analysts might be pleased the Wynn/Crown deal didn’t get too far. Steve Wynn, the billionaire behind the casino brand, is mired in a sexual misconduct investigation in the US that could result in the company being stripped of its gaming licence in Massachusetts, where it plans to launch a $2.6bn hotel and casino near Boston in June, called the Encore Boston Harbor. He resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wynn in February last year following the allegations against him.   
  “There’s too much going on,” said Eunice Lee, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong. The offer probably looked sweeter to Crown shareholders. The Crown business initially flourished and expanded to the US, Macau and elsewhere, but after 19 employees were arrested in China in 2016 and later convicted of “gambling-related crimes”, Packer retreated to Australia and sold most of the group’s overseas assets. Several major casino operators around the world are rolling the dice. Caesars Entertainment, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has held talks about a potential merger with Tilman Fertitta’s Golden Nugget casino chain as well as other suitors. The takeover, if agreed by Crown shareholders, would’ve marked the end of an era for the Packer dynasty, which has played a central role in Australian business for almost a century. But as the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships. Wall Street banks get their fingers burnt in cyber security LBO The record-breaking $100bn of orders that flooded Saudi Aramco’s landmark bond sale on Tuesday has left many observers asking how financial markets professionals have been able to move on so quickly from last year’s killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But elsewhere in the debt markets, Jefferies and Credit Suisse have found out the hard way that there are limits to what investors consider ethical to buy.   
  The two Wall Street banks have got their fingers burnt underwriting the leveraged buyout of a controversial Israeli cyber security company, which is being sued by a Saudi dissident who claims its software was used to spy on Khashoggi. Israel’s NSO Group has said that the suit is “completely unfounded”, denying its software was used to track Khashoggi. It also insists that the company is “committed to the ethical and responsible use of our technology”. The rush of headlines around NSO have meant Jefferies and Credit Suisse have struggled to find buyers for the $510m debt deal, with the two investment banks now set to lose money on the deal backing UK private equity firm Novalpina Capital’s acquisition of the Israeli group. Novalpina’s founder Stephen Peel, a former senior partner at private equity heavyweight TPG, set up the company with the express aim of investing in geographies and sectors where more traditional sponsors fear to tread. The company’s 2018 takeover of Baltic gaming group Olympic Entertainment is a good example. The NSO deal has attracted a lot of heat. Amnesty International wrote an open letter to Novalpina in February raising concerns that NSO’s software was being used to target people “solely as a result of their criticism of governments”. Peel stepped down from the board of international human rights group Global Witness the same day. He then wrote a letter in response to Amnesty last month that outlined the private equity group’s due diligence into NSO, which he said found no evidence to “substantiate the misuse allegations”.

Companies — and their lawyers — pack in every thing that could possibly go wrong to protect against any future legal claim. But the reading may be more interesting when Uber makes its documents public for its upcoming stock market flotation, expected to be one of the biggest in US corporate history. The car-booking company’s history of legal battles and regulatory entanglements casts a long shadow, reports the FT’s Shannon Bond. Securities lawyers and corporate governance experts say investors should prepare for lengthy disclosures about lawsuits and government investigations, including any issues dating back to its hard-charging co-founder and former chief executive, Travis Kalanick.   
  The company has been pushing to clean up its trail of rule-breaking and aggressive tactics for the past 18 months under Mr Kalanick’s successor, Dara Khosrowshahi. But at the top of the mind for prospective shareholders will be the risks at the heart of Uber’s business model. It relies on a workforce that the company doesn’t consider employees — and therefore doesn’t have to meet regulations about pay and benefits. That’s kept labour costs down for Uber and its peers in the gig economy, but has also sparked a backlash from workers and scrutiny from regulators. “I can’t think of a bigger risk to them than the idea that these people will become employees,” said John Coffee, a Columbia University securities law expert. Job moves The Carlyle Group has hired Leigh Farris as a managing director and global head of corporate communications. Farris was previously a managing director and chief executive of communications at Goldman Sachs.

"UBS warns of worsening climate as clients pull $13bn of money","Swiss bank’s ‘very poor’ earnings miss analyst expectations and send shares down","UBS cast a shadow across Europe’s banking sector as Switzerland’s biggest lender blamed an economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions for missing analysts’ profit forecasts and for causing almost $13bn of client outflows.  The disappointing outcome of the first European bank to announce annual results followed a patchy performance from the biggest Wall Street banks last week and triggered a sell-off in shares of UBS and several of its rivals in Europe. UBS’s market-leading wealth management unit was hit by a $7.9bn reduction in assets in the period as ultra-wealthy clients pulled money from plunging stock markets.  Combined with $4.9bn of investor withdrawals at its asset management business, that reduced the amount of net new money it collected last year to $49.5bn — less than half of the amount it collected the previous year. UBS’s pre-tax profit rose just 2 per cent to $862m in the fourth quarter, failing to meet the average analyst estimate of $985m, and its shares dropped more than 4 per cent.  Executives warned the negative environment had spilled over into the first few weeks of this year, but said they had seen some “normalisation” in markets more recently. “These are very poor results, and come as somewhat of a negative surprise so soon after the upbeat investor day” in October, said Citigroup analyst Andrew Coombs. “The investment bank was a sizeable miss” on estimates and “wealth management was hit by large outflows”, he said, adding that “the bank’s targets for 2019 look increasingly difficult to achieve”. We are taking commercial and responsible actions to mitigate the short-term impact of difficult markets . . . and return to our trajectory of growthSergio Ermotti, UBS chief The news added to bearish sentiment about Europe’s already downtrodden banking sector. Shares in Deutsche Bank fell 3.4 per cent, while Switzerland’s Julius Baer dropped 3 per cent and France’s BNP Paribas lost 2 per cent. “Look, it is a very difficult fourth quarter,” Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of rival Credit Suisse, told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Things have gotten better since the beginning of the year.” Credit Suisse shares were down 1.2 per cent. UBS’s investment bank swung to a $47m loss in the fourth quarter from a $46m profit last year due to “challenging conditions” in credit and equities trading, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.  An improvement in foreign exchange and rates trading revenues offset these slightly, but the investment bank’s revenue was still down more than $200m. Its performance in bond trading was similar to the declines reported by Wall Street rivals, but the drop off in its equities trading revenues contrasted with strong growth at US peers. On an annual basis, the bank’s 2018 pre-tax profit increased 19 per cent to $6.4bn driven by increased revenue from wealth management in the first three quarters of the year, as well as reduced restructuring and litigation expenses. Return on equity improved to 10.8 per cent from 2.2 per cent. Referring to the total net new money inflow last year, Sergio Ermotti, UBS chief executive, said: “The overall results for the year are clearly not satisfactory, to meet our goals we need to intensify efforts to attract and retain higher portions of our current and prospective clients’ assets. “We are taking commercial and responsible actions to mitigate the short-term impact of difficult markets . . . and return to our trajectory of growth.” Mr Ermotti characterised these actions as “fuel-saving mode” and said options open to the bank included hiring fewer new staff, replacing those who leave more gradually and implementing IT projects over a longer period to save costs. Since taking over in 2011, Mr Ermotti has restructured UBS to focus on managing the assets of the world’s rich, and has reduced the investment bank to a supporting role. However, the bank has faced pressure to prove it can expand its global wealth management division, which was created last year by merging US and international operations, even in difficult market conditions. The shares fell 29 per cent last year. On a brighter note, the bank said it bought back SFr750m of shares in 2018, exceeding its target by SFr200m, and it planned to repurchase another $1bn this year.  Kian Abouhossein, a JPMorgan analyst, said: “Investor confidence loss leading to higher volatility, declining equity markets and deleveraging of the ultra-wealthy . . . could be felt in the results. We see these results more a market condition issue rather than a UBS issue.” The weak results raised questions over UBS’s ability to hit new financial targets it set in October, aiming for growth in pre-tax profits in wealth management at the upper end of its 10 to 15 per cent target in the three years to the end of 2021. It is also targeting 2-4 per cent net new money growth per year. “We had a substantial number of deals pulled in the fourth quarter, the problem is not the pipeline, it is the environment,” Mr Ermotti. UBS is also wrangling with executive succession after last year losing the high-profile head of its investment bank division, Andrea Orcel, who left to become chief executive of Banco Santander. However, two weeks ago the appointment fell through in a dispute over €50m of deferred pay that he was owed by UBS, which the Spanish bank’s board refused to buy him out of. Axel Weber, the Swiss bank’s chairman, has said he is looking for external candidates to strengthen the bank’s internal roster of chief executive contenders, and has had talks with former Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment banking chief Christian Meissner about joining as a potential future chief executive. “In terms of succession, I find it a little bit entertaining as a storyline, a mix of reading my obituary and being like a mosquito in the middle of the summer — something I get the impression you’d like to get rid of,” said Mr Ermotti. “The truth is anything is many years away, we have a process to look at internal and external candidates.” UBS said the fourth-quarter sell-off in markets would reduce recurring revenues in its wealth management and asset management units.  It added: “Lack of progress in resolving geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism and trade disputes along with increased volatility, which affected investor sentiment and confidence in the second half of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018, would affect client activity in the first quarter of 2019.”","22.01.2019"
"Greece wins €11.8bn of bids for first 10-year bond since crisis","Long-dated debt sale raises €2.5bn after Moody’s upgrade","Greece has sold its first 10-year bond for nine years, in the latest sign of the ‘Goldilocks’ conditions in the eurozone’s sovereign debt market.  The country, which formed the focal point of Europe’s debt crisis from 2009, raised €2.5bn of paper priced at a 3.9 per cent yield; order books topped €11.8bn. This is Greece’s first 10-year bond issue since March 2010, weeks before it was shut out of international capital markets and forced to seek the first of three bailouts from the EU and the International Monetary Fund. A series of blockbuster bond sales since the start of the year has bucked forecasts that demand might suffer after the European Central Bank put an end to its bond-buying programme. The market began to thrive after January’s policy U-turn by the US Federal Reserve, which was followed by a gloomy update from the ECB, confirming to investors that global interest rates were unlikely to rise in coming months.  That is a boon for European governments with debt to sell, as investors are drawn to the additional yield on offer from longer-dated bonds. Greece’s move comes just days after Moody’s applauded progress in repairing the country’s battered finances. Late on Friday the rating agency lifted Greece by two notches to a B1 rating — still among the so-called junk ratings that indicate a higher level of risk, but nonetheless a sign of rehabilitation for a country now aiming to deliver primary budget surpluses every year between 2018 and 2022. The move saw Greek bond yields fall to their lowest levels since before the eurozone debt crisis, indicating a rise in price. On Monday, the thinly-traded Greek 10-year bond yield hit a low of 3.6 per cent.  Greece emerged last August from a €86bn bailout, its third, after enduring the deepest recession on record. By then it had ventured into the international bond markets twice, raising €3bn of five-year money in July 2017 and a further €3bn of seven-year bonds in February last year. But turmoil in the wider international markets forced the postponement of the country’s first post-bailout debt sale until the start of this year, when it raised €2.5bn in five-year debt priced at a yield of 3.6 per cent. Christina Cho, a senior debt markets banker at BNP Paribas who acted for Greece on Tuesday’s deal, said the country’s strategy was “about returning to normality and becoming a normal sovereign issuer in the capital markets again, building incrementally over each successive issue”. Greece was attracting a growing number of investors and more international interest in each successive debt sale, according to Ms Cho. “They don’t have to issue til the early 2020s for financing needs — their cash buffer covers all disbursements — so the point of accessing the capital markets now is as much a confidence exercise as it is a funding exercise,” she said.  Greece’s 2019 budget provides for raising €4bn on capital markets, but the debt management agency hopes to raise as much as €7bn if market conditions allow. BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and JPMorgan acted as joint lead managers on Tuesday’s bond sale.","05.03.2019"

Threefold, said Edison Lee, an analyst at Jefferies, who sees it as possibly disrupting Huawei’s supply chain, delaying China’s 5G roll-out and even stymying last-minute trade talks. On the first point, the precedent is pretty ugly. When smaller rival ZTE was shut out of the US, its smartphone shipments plummeted by about 75 per cent and it blew a Rmb7.8bn ($1.1bn) hole in its bottom line in the first half of last year. With revenues last year of $105bn, Huawei is a lot bigger than ZTE and its greater focus on telecoms infrastructure equipment and high-end phones means the impact of an export ban “would be material”, Credit Suisse analysts said in a report at the end of last year. About 20 to 30 per cent of Huawei’s bill of materials is related to semiconductors, the analysts reckon, equivalent to $15bn worth of chips, or 3.8 per cent of global industry production versus just 0.5 per cent for ZTE. Tech Wash: why Trump’s move against Huawei has scared US businesses The existence of Huawei-owned HiSilicon means it is highly unlikely to have to shut down production — the fate of ZTE for a few tense months — but it would need to look elsewhere to procure key components such as radiofrequency chips, important for high-end 4G products, which Huawei sources mainly from Qorvo and Skyworks. Mark Li, an analyst at Bernstein, said alternative suppliers are limited but would include Murata of Japan. Chips supplied by Intel and field-programmable gate arrays — chips that can be configured after the producer supplies them and that are vital for Huawei’s networking equipment products — could also be a bottleneck. Xilinx is Huawei’s main FPGA supplier. Analysts said Huawei could also run into problems while continuing to use patents from Universal Display for its organic light-emitting diode displays, as well as mobile patents from Qualcomm and Google patents for the Android operating system in Huawei smartphones.  What has Huawei done to protect itself? Huawei has had years to prepare for this, and is more cushioned than ZTE. It has taken steps towards vertical integration; its fabless chip subsidiary HiSilicon designs chipsets — though it still relies on Taiwan’s TSMC to actually make them — and its 70-strong list of major suppliers is largely based in China. Mr Lee reckoned that Huawei began building up inventories at the start of this year following the detention of Meng Wanzhou, its finance chief, initially targeting inventories of six to nine months’ supply, but subsequently raising that to one or even two years. Beyond components such as FPGA and RF chips, some other parts of the supply chain may offer more alternatives. “They buy from Micron but can substitute Korean Hynix/Micron and Invensense with some European sensor suppliers,” said one analyst who asked not to be identified. Will being big help or hinder Huawei? Huawei is the world’s biggest telecoms equipment manufacturer, with 28 per cent of the market, according to research company Dell’Oro, far ahead of its European competitors Ericsson and Nokia, and boasts more global 5G contracts than anyone else.  But as it sells more — it anticipates sales of $120bn this year — the company’s demand for parts is increasing. This means its “dependency on external components is very high”, noted Bernstein’s Mr Li. With the build-up of 5G and concomitant demand for components, it now buys or licenses from Intel, Qualcomm and Qorvo in the US, alternative suppliers in South Korea and Japan might face capacity limitations to act as substitutes, analysts said. How bad is the risk of contagion? Like the trade war, placing Huawei on the Entity List cuts both ways: US manufacturers lose a revenue stream. Qualcomm, in the throes of negotiating a final licence agreement with Huawei, booked $150m of royalties from the Chinese company in its latest quarter as a “minimum non-refundable” royalties payment while discussions continue. While US national carriers have spurned Huawei for years, rural and enterprise networks have proved far less squeamish. Thanks in part to hefty spending on research and development, Huawei produces kit that is seen by users as good quality and cheap.  Gordon Smith, who as chief executive of Sagent works with enterprises on their networks, said equipment in the sector typically has a shelf life of three to five years. If Huawei is not an option, companies will have to turn to the likes of Cisco and Juniper for routers and switches.  How will Beijing respond to the blacklisting? China met Washington’s previous sabre-rattling at Huawei by singing the praises of its national champion at home. It worked. In the first quarter of the year Huawei grew sales in a declining market, shipping just shy of 30m smartphones to grab a 34 per cent market share, according to Canalys. Few if any in China — and not an insignificant number in the US — see Washington’s fight with Huawei as purely concerned with national security but also as part of wider angst about trade with China and its rising tech prowess. When asked about a possible Huawei ban on Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “The US has for a while abused its national strength to maliciously slander and press specific Chinese companies in an unscrupulous manner. This is not only dishonourable but also unjust.”","16.05.2019"
"Investors resist panic as the tariff clock ticks","Mike Mackenzie’s daily analysis of what’s moving global markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email. Financial markets remain captive to the looming tariff deadline set by President Donald Trump. By the end of the week, investors will know whether the US does raise tariffs on Chinese goods and the likely response from Beijing.  The shifts across global markets so far this week, outside of Chinese equities, have been relatively contained, indicating how investors are resisting panic and sticking to the view that it serves the interests of both Washington and Beijing to reach an agreement after more than a year of negotiations. In that vein, so long as the US and China continue talking, market sentiment will lean towards optimism of an eventual trade deal. There was a glimmer of this on Wednesday after Wall Street opened and that suggests the market may also look beyond the expected rise in tariffs on Friday. China’s vice-premier Liu He will arrive in Washington on Thursday for an abbreviated round of talks.   Across equity markets there are varying levels of sensitivity among global benchmarks. China has led the losses with the CSI 300 now back at its mid-March level, indicating how investors think Beijing has more to lose such as jobs and production moving offshore. One point to note is that Chinese equities began falling during the second half of April (call it a healthy correction after their big run) and returned from an extended holiday last week to the news of Tariff Man upping the trade ante. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Europe’s Stoxx 600 have dropped to early-March levels, highlighting that they are next in line for taking a hit from an escalating trade war. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have tested areas seen a month ago. The mood on Wall Street suggests many think Mr Trump is bluffing and could well signal a deal awaits after the latest round of negotiations in Washington this week. Signs of cooler heads prevailing as China and the US continue their trade negotiations would likely spur a rebound in share prices and tighter risk premiums for credit. More importantly from the perspective of emerging markets, the US dollar should ease and government bond yields should rise from near the lower end of their recent range. At this juncture, the Bloomberg Barclays local currency EM debt index has slumped to its early-January level as the JPMorgan EM Currency index has erased its 2019 gains.   In contrast, US equity volatility has not risen much beyond its long-term average reading of 20 this week, although someone is buying insurance against the risk of a bigger jump. Plenty of traders have sold volatility in recent months and option volumes on the CBOE’s Vix are surging, hitting their highest daily amount since February of 2018 on Tuesday according to Credit Suisse, with calls accounting for three-quarters of activity.  So for now jumping on the fear trade is fraught with risk, but that does not mean markets are immune from a shock as trade talks resume.  Sebastien Galy at Nordea Investment Funds lays out the challenge for both sides in their trade spat: “The US would need to back down for China to save face. For that, China would need to reverse its course after backtracking.” He adds: “China overplayed its hand recently and may still overplay it again by assuming the Trump administration is afraid of a market correction. What it is after is to get re-elected and that may well mean widening out the tariffs. The question is therefore whether the Chinese will blink because they value short-term growth more than their stature as the other superpower. The next few days may well be quite volatile.” A danger comes from a breakdown in talks after a prolonged period of false dawns that would open the door towards a genuine bout of risk aversion, primarily led by China and Europe. But global turmoil would ensnare Wall Street’s key sector, technology, along with other US companies that are reliant on global sales as seen late last year when trade tension previously left a mark. As currency strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch point out: “We have been arguing that trade tensions is a key reason for data weakness outside the US, and particularly in the eurozone and China. The global economy took a sharp turn to the worse when the US introduced the 10% tariff rate on half of imports from China last year. A further escalation from the US and a likely retaliation from China would be a full-blown trade war . . . with very negative implications for the global economy.” Now BofA’s base case remains one of compromise, but they do acknowledge how the risk of a nasty breakdown is rising, noting: “In addition, the US-EU trade negotiations have not led to a deal yet and remain a risk for the European economy and markets more broadly.” So while some observers note the lack of a larger and more damaging rout across markets, particularly in the US, this is hardly a surprising development. Still, the clock is ticking and what heightens the tension for markets is that this year’s already robust performance means steep declines may be required before either side backs down. Moreover, the prospect of central banks riding to the rescue only appears likely in the event of a dramatic slide that threatens confidence among consumers and business.  Global equities began May facing a period of sideways trading, reflecting the need for a pause until stronger signs of a resilient economy over the summer would affirm this year’s rally in risk assets. Now the threat of an escalating trade war has returned, competing with the other two big macro issues: whether China stimulus bolsters the global economy and have central banks done enough to support a rebound in activity after their new year policy pivots.    Be ready when the London market opens, with Cat Rutter Pooley’

 Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar Trade war correlations — UBS show, via this table, the equity markets and sectors that are the most and least sensitive to an escalating trade war.  As the banks notes:  “Dax has the highest correlation to the performance of trade-impacted stocks, both in absolute terms and relative to regional benchmarks. At the sector level, we have shown that Metals & Mining are most exposed to the performance of those stocks.” US 10-year note sale — The $27bn issue of 10-year Treasuries was met with lower than usual demand, reflecting the recent drop in yields. Reasons for upping bond exposure — Here’s Oxford Economics on why moving from cash to core government bonds makes sense, while reducing overweight positions in risk assets. “As we expected earlier in the year, the relationship between bond and equity returns has turned asymmetric with bonds gaining a lot when equities falter but losing a lot less when equities rally. This makes a core bonds hedge even more attractive.” Keep up to date with the top M&A stories, sharp analysis and insight on the dealmakers —

"Deutsche slides down European investment bank rankings","German lender falls to fourth place behind US rivals after tumultuous year","Deutsche Bank has lost further ground to US rivals on its home turf, falling to fourth place in Europe in a benchmark ranking of the world’s investment banks and adding to pressure on executives as they consider a merger with Commerzbank. The ranking showed the embattled German lender falling behind Citigroup and Goldman Sachs — number two and three respectively — in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region in the second half of last year, according to the latest data from industry monitor Coalition. In the first six months of 2018, the three were ranked joint second after JPMorgan. Deutsche had another difficult year last year, with high-profile defections, misconduct scandals, thousands more job cuts and withdrawals from some lines of business, which explain in part its declining revenue position. Over the weekend, it embarked on government-mandated merger discussions with domestic rival Commerzbank in a last-ditch attempt to arrest its decline. Offsetting the decline in Europe, in the global ranking Deutsche retained its sixth place on the strength of its US and European fixed-income businesses, whereas equity trading was its weak spot in both regions. It also improved its standing in fast-growing Asia-Pacific markets in the second half of 2018. In 2017, it came a clear second in Emea, above Citi and Goldman. JPMorgan was once again ranked the world’s biggest investment bank by revenue — a title it has held every year since 2010 — and was ranked number one or two in all of the 14 ranking categories, apart from cash equities and municipal finance. Goldman continued its resurgence in the league table, fuelled by revenue growth across the board in the Americas in fixed-income trading, equities and banking. Under new chief executive David Solomon, it also regained the coveted top spot in global M&A from JPMorgan, which occupied the position in the first half of 2018. The performance puts Goldman back on a par with Citi — last year’s global number two by a whisker. Goldman had fallen behind during a bruising 2017 when its bond trading and commodities units had lower client activity and trading losses. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America complete the global top five. Overall, 2018 was one of the toughest years since the crisis for most investment banks, particularly towards the end, as geopolitical tensions, trade war fears, poor economic growth forecasts and Brexit combined to drive clients to the sidelines and reduce trading and M&A volumes. European banks were particularly badly hit, announcing more cuts and reining in their ambitions after an atrocious fourth-quarter where many posted double-digit falls in trading revenue. George Kuznetsov, head of research and analysis at Coalition, said the negative conditions had spilled over into this year. “We expect a challenging 2019 and a really poor first quarter with no significant recovery in fixed-income” or equity trading, Mr Kuznetsov said. He also noted the dominance Wall Street has achieved — with US banks taking the top three positions in the Emea region for the first time in many years. Barclays, which under chief executive Jes Staley is making a big push in trading, came seventh globally and moved up to sixth from eighth in Europe after reporting the strongest revenue growth of any bank last year, Coalition said. Credit Suisse fell one place to eighth, UBS and HSBC were jointly ninth, followed by France’s BNP Paribas and Société Générale, both of which slashed their financial targets and promised to cut a combined €850m of costs from their investment banks after dire performances in trading in the second half of the year.","21.03.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Hermès, Anglo American, Centrica, Superdry, Coty","Watch out for falling diamond prices, says UBS","Friday 14:30 GMT What’s happening ● Hermès led the luxury goods makers higher after reporting 9.6 per cent organic sales growth last quarter, a percentage point better than expected. An acceleration in China compensated for slowing demand in the Americas and stable sales in Europe, with currency effects providing another tailwind. By product category the star performer was leather goods, which account for half of Hermès’ sales. Silk sales suffered due to a reliance on the French market. “Overall, Hermès management’s tone was confident during the fourth-quarter sales call and it looks like 2019 is off to a relatively good start. Hermès’ release follows LVMH’s strong report last week and should prove reassuring to the market regarding the luxury goods industry trends. That being said, we would argue that one cannot fully extrapolate Hermès and LVMH stronger than expected fourth-quarter performance for the rest of the market, as these groups benefited from the polarisation of performance in the market, ie. the largest brands gaining share.”Morgan Stanley ● Coty, the cosmetics maker under brands including Max Factor and Rimmel, rallied sharply after its fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings beat lowered forecasts. The key positive, said analysts, was a 10.8 per cent improvement in same-store sales for Coty’s luxury division thanks largely to its Burberry licence. At the headline Coty posted a 0.7 per cent fall in like-for-like sales and core earnings per share of $0.24, which was two cents above consensus forecasts, though the beat was largely on financial expenses and a lower tax rate. Operating profit guidance for 2019 was cut to imply a fall from the 2018 level but a target of positive cash flow was maintained. Coty was the S&P 500’s worst performer last year, plummeting 65 per cent. “We expect investors to see this print as an inflection and bears to cover their short positions because the news flow will likely be more positive going forward, although the mass beauty category remains out of favour.”JPMorgan ● Rockwool of Denmark was among the Stoxx 600’s sharpest fallers after the insulation maker posted weaker than expected full-year earnings and 2019 guidance. Fourth-quarter revenue matched forecasts at €710m but earnings of €83m missed consensus by about 10 per cent as margins suffered on unhelpful weather across Europe through December, as well as a shortage of construction workers in Germany and legal fees in the US. For 2019 Rockwool guided sales growth of between 4 and 8 per cent, rather than the 9 per cent investors had expected. The company saw positive construction trends but expected more pressure from competitors Knuaf and Paroc in Europe to cap price inflation. It also flagged rising haulage costs and said lower oil prices were likely to be helpful for plastic insulation substitutes. “Rockwool mainly has spot orders and therefore little insight to their guidance potential. Therefore the guidance is likely on the conservative side. We expect estimates and the stock down 10 per cent for the day.”ABG Sundal Collier Sellside stories ● UBS downgraded Anglo American to “sell” from “neutral” with an unchanged £18 target. Anglo had rallied 14 per cent in the year to date on the back of higher commodity prices, the restart of production at its Minas Rio mine in Brazil and a share transfer by Volcan Investments — a family trust of Vedanta founder Anil Agarwal — to Cairn India.  “Anglo is the least attractive of the UK diversified miners as: 1) cash returns to shareholders are materially lower than peers; 2) volume growth is only in line with peers at around 3 per cent per annum (and materially worse on a per-share basis after buybacks); 3) the risk/reward of Anglo’s key commodities is skewed to the downside. Near-term, we see headline risk going into the South African elections and potential for a material disruption at Minas Rio after the Brumadinho tragedy.”UBS In a separate report on diamond miners, UBS said demand looked softer than expected and inventories were elevated in the short term, with advertising underspend and synthetics posing medium-term risks. That led it to trim operating earnings forecasts for Anglo’s De Beers unit by 10 per cent. ● Citigroup downgraded Centrica, the British Gas owner, to “neutral” from “buy”.  “Centrica shares are already fully reflecting the challenging retail market and pricing in a probable dividend cut with its 9 per cent dividend yield. However, unless Centrica is able to revitalise its current strategy by delivering growth in some of its new business lines or to curb the level of churn in retail or to improve the commodity output, we see little reason for investors to own the shares.”Citi With continued customer losses and the two growth divisions Connected Home and Distributed Energy remaining lossmaking, Centrica has struggled to demonstrate the tangible success of its strategy, said Citi. New management may revisit the plan but, in the absence of a major strategic update, operating cash flow will look increasingly fragile, it said. The broker expected Centrica to retain its 12p dividend this year but anticipated investors would look beyond that.  ● Stifel downgraded fashion label Superdry to “sell” from “hold” with a 460p price target. It saw wholesale revenues as a problem for the 2020 financial year as stockists will have an excess to clear, potentially slowing the rehabilitation of the brand, it said. That followed Superdry management saying that inventory would rise by the end of the year because of unsold autumn/winter season clothes.  “Management says product improvements are unlikely until autumn-winter 2019 at the earliest. This looks distant given negative earnings momentum. The stock trades at 8.4 times 2019 earnings on current consensus estimates but we think [with] uncertainty ahead, the time required to turn around the brand and related execution risk require a deeper discount to the sector.”Stifel ● In brief: Alstom cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Assura downgraded to “hold” at Liberum; Bankia upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Citycon cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; DS Smith rated new “buy” at Citigroup; Daimler downgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Enel raised to “hold” at HSBC; GEA cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; HolidayCheck downgraded to “reduce” at HSBC; Neste cut to “neutral” at UBS; Ocean Outdoor rated new “overweight” at Barclays; Rio Tinto downgraded to “hold” at Investec; Sagax downgraded to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Thales upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup; Travis Perkins upgraded to “outperform” at RBC; UniCredit upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup; Unite downgraded to “hold” at Liberum.

"The devil wears sustainable nylon, as Prada heir makes his mark","Lorenzo Bertelli oversees bags made from recycled fabric after joining family group","Former racing driver Lorenzo Bertelli has been marked out as the planned successor to his billionaire parents Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli © FT montage / Getty It is two years since Lorenzo Bertelli, heir to the Prada fashion fortune, switched between the seemingly incongruous worlds of motorsport and luxury fashion by retiring as a racing-car driver to join the family firm. But the 31-year-old eldest son of billionaire Prada owners and co-chief executives Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli says a decade spent on the racetrack is the perfect preparation for the high-paced world of luxury goods. “You learn to fall off and get up. It was a great school of life,” says Mr Bertelli of the years he spent travelling 200 days a year to compete as a professional Formula 2 rally driver — narrowly missing out once on winning a championship. “At the beginning people said ‘you are the son of…’” he recalls in his first face-to-face interview since entering the family business. “But then I won a race in the world championships and I was judged as a driver in my own name.”
 Marked out as the planned successor to his billionaire parents, who are 70 and 73 years old respectively, his role as head of marketing and communications will be pivotal in turning the family business round. His unexpected arrival has staunched speculation that the family could sell to a bigger rival, such as Swiss-listed Richemont.  © Alberto Bernasconi It is also part of a wider generational change in Europe’s luxury goods dynasties. From LVMH to Salvatore Ferragamo and Ermenegildo Zegna, younger, often millennial, offspring are taking on bigger roles at their family companies. Guido Corbetta, professor of family capitalism at Milan’s Bocconi University, says globalisation and technological disruption had forced a change of guard as an older generation had struggled to keep pace. The moves have coincided with a reassessment of the value of family groups amid a widespread collapse of faith in Wall Street-style shareholder capitalism. A recent Credit Suisse report found that family-owned companies had outperformed local peers by almost 5 per cent per year since 2006. “I want to continue the family business,” says Mr Bertelli, who has an easy-going charm that contrasts with his aloof, cerebral mother and combative father.   Joining the family company “was never imposed on me”, he says. He has a younger brother who is a sailor and so far has remained outside the business. “I do not have a problem with taking myself out of the running if I find I am not up to the job,” he adds. His first high-profile step towards taking over the running of Prada, which also owns the Miu Miu, Church’s, Marchesi and Car Shoe brands, was to this week unveil an eye-catching push into sustainability.  By 2021, Prada intends to substitute its entire nylon supply chain of 700,000 linear metres a year with a sustainable version. In the first instance, it is launching six bags in a so-called Re-Nylon collection made using synthetic fabric from recycled ocean plastic, fishing nets and textile industry waste. Wearing a denim jacket from the Prada menswear range and seated in an all-white cube of a Prada office in downtown Milan, he says: “Being a good entrepreneur means considering the social value first.” Images from his mother’s catwalk shows hang on one wall.  Prada’s decision to reboot its nylon sourcing has significance beyond the ecological import. The Milanese fashion house’s elevation of nylon into a luxury good defined its emergence as a cutting edge brand in the 1980s. It has been seeking to reignite that “cool” factor with consumers after several years of falling sales. Mr Bertelli calls the launch of the Re-Nylon products “the start of a new era”, adding: “It takes time to do things well,” in a reference to Prada’s broader business turnround. You need to use data but it is important to make errors, to allow the creative space to createLorenzo Bertelli Hong Kong-listed Prada, which is 80 per cent owned by the family holding company, posted its first annual increase in sales for five years in 2018. But the progress has since been rocky. Slower Chinese spending contributed to an unexpected drop in like-for-like sales in the first quarter of this year.  Thomas Chauvet, analyst at Citi, downgraded Prada to a “sell” rating this month arguing it had “failed to deliver on high hopes of brand rejuvenation”. Nonetheless, he noted that on a full-year 2021 price to earnings basis shares still traded at a 50 per cent premium to the sector on expectations of a rebound in sales and profit margins.  Mr Bertelli’s role will be decisive as to whether the reboot works. With social media upending luxury strategy, communications and marketing has become the crucial department at the point of convergence between the designer, big data and the consumer. Ironically, it was his parents failure to spot the disrupting effect of technology on luxury sales that caused Prada to lose some of its grip on consumers. Sustainability has become a flashpoint in the luxury industry, according to consultants Bain. That is particularly the case with Mr Bertelli’s fellow millennials who are driving industry growth by shopping on their smartphones for the likes of €2,000 Prada Matinee handbags and €950 Prada Block combat-style boots. © Alberto Bernasconi Analysts also put the industry-leading success of brands such as Gucci down to sophisticated processing of big data which gives immediate feedback on what consumers want, be it more sustainable fashion or thick-soled sneakers.  Mr Bertelli is sceptical about being too data driven, arguing that if all the brands follow the same data they end up sheeplike, all producing identical collections. He wants to renew a push to put Ms Prada, his award-winning mother and one of the few remaining founder designers, front and centre. “We need to have the courage to not just make decisions that are marketing driven. You need to use insights and data to avoid big errors, to allow the creative space to create,” he says.  His latest role, he says, is part of a “comprehensive” path through the business agreed with his parents from “valley” to “summit”. Although he declines to give a timeframe for when they plan for him to reach the top.  Before getting his new job, Mr Bertelli took his initial steps at the family business in another new frontier for new luxury: haute food and beverage. Prada bought Milanese coffee and cake shop, Marchesi, in 2014, shortly after LVMH was snapping up another Milanese coffee institution, Cova. Mr Bertelli says Marchesi will open 10 to 15 coffee stores in key cities. Last month, it opened in London’s Mayfair. He says his father has also asked for his advice about Prada’s product lines targeting Generation Z buyers aged 20 to 25 years old: Linea Rossa, a sportswear brand relaunched last year, and the sneakers business. The biggest influence from his parents, he says, came from growing up “in a house where I learnt a love of details and a love of doing things in the right way. A love of beautiful things made well”. It is a quality, he argues, that is as relevant to learning about a race-car engine as to a nylon knapsack made of fishing nets.","25.06.2019"
"Mozambique’s ruling party closes ranks over ‘tuna bond’ scandal","Frelimo largely silent since indictment of ex-finance minister in $2bn hidden loans saga","Mozambique’s ruling party has closed ranks since US officials indicted the southern African nation’s former finance minister and former Credit Suisse bankers over a $2bn hidden loans and bribery scandal.
 Under President Filipe Nyusi, the Frelimo party has been largely silent since Manuel Chang was detained and sought for US extradition over one of Africa’s biggest corruption cases. An indictment this month accused Mr Chang, a sitting Frelimo MP, of approving a scheme for government officials to siphon at least $200m from a series of international borrowings by front companies, including a tuna fishing company, which took advantage of investor enthusiasm for vast offshore gas finds. But it is unlikely that Mr Nyusi will follow the examples of Malaysia, which is trying to claw back billions of dollars from its 1MDB scandal, or Angola, whose president has unexpectedly pursued the former ruling family over allegations of corruption. “I don’t see him cleaning the system like the Malaysians or the Angolans, but rather a survival strategy,” said Adriano Nuvunga, head of ADS, a Mozambican civil society group. “Here we are discussing the survival of Frelimo as a political party and as a government. You have to take that into account.” Analysts and activists see Frelimo, which has governed Mozambique since its independence in 1975, as more likely to maintain an omerta-like system of loyalty and patronage than to punish its own ahead of polls this year. Under pressure over its inaction compared with the US, last week Mozambique’s public prosecutor named individuals it was investigating over the debts. But the list shows why it might not ask too many tough questions. The names include a former central bank governor, intelligence chiefs and civil servants who served under Armando Guebuza, president when the hidden debts were issued. He remains a powerbroker overshadowing Mr Nyusi. Manuel Chang has been accused of approving a scheme for government officials to siphon off at least $200m from a series of international borrowings by front companies © Reuters Only financial penalties are being sought, as opposed to criminal charges. Mozambique is opposing Mr Chang’s extradition in favour of trying him at home — something few believe Frelimo would actually allow. The origins of the scandal point to the opportunities for corruption that were created when a poor country discovered gas in 2009. Just two years later one of the world’s largest shipbuilders, Abu Dhabi-based Privinvest, pitched officials an ambitious project to secure the country’s shores. The plan would eventually span coastal radar and patrol vessels, as well as tuna boats. Mozambique has one of Africa’s longest coastlines — and plentiful tuna. But it also has security forces that are politicised, opaque, and welded to Frelimo patronage by the legacy of the country’s long post-independence civil conflict. The US indictment describes an unnamed official telling Jean Boustani, an agent of Privinvest: “There will be other players whose interest will have to be looked after eg ministry of defence, ministry of interior, air force, etc . . . In democratic countries like ours people come and go, and everyone will want to have his/her share of the deal while in office, because once out of the office it will be difficult.”  Mr Boustani arranged bribes worth $50m for officials, according to the indictment. They were allegedly clumsily concealed as 50m “chickens”. Even this sum was only part of the kickbacks and bribes that were eventually laundered with the help of the Credit Suisse bankers, according to US prosecutors. The $200m is probably an understatement of the level of looting. A forensic report by the risk consultancy Kroll in 2017 could not account for where $500m of the amount raised by the loans had gone. The tuna boats have lain rusting in a harbour in Maputo, the capital, for years. Privinvest has denied overpayment, and is examining the allegations made by the US, its spokesperson said. Mr Boustani denies wrongdoing, his lawyer told a US judge. There has been speculation in Mozambique that Mr Nyusi, a defence minister under Mr Guebuza, must have known of the looting. “There is no way that he can distinguish himself vis-à-vis the people implicated,” Mr Nuvunga said. Mr Nyusi denies wrongdoing. At stake is repairing the economic damage left by the hidden loans. The IMF, a major funder, cut ties when the debt’s full extent was uncovered in 2016. It set off a financial crisis. The debts went into default. The government has made progress on a restructuring programme, seen as crucial to unlocking financing for gas development where international majors such as Exxon and Anadarko are investors. But the US case has revived uncertainty. “No one hinted that this would be a scenario,” said Alex Vines, Africa director at Chatham House. “It’s too soon to say whether this strengthens or weakens the president. Potentially it would strengthen him, but the politics are unpredictable.” While Frelimo is likely to back Mr Nyusi to run again in this year’s poll, analysts say Mr Guebuza retains the loyalty of many of its members in parliament, which ruled the hidden debts were legal in 2017. Outsiders may also have an interest in avoiding a divided Frelimo. Mr Vines added that the US was unlikely to pursue Mr Guebuza directly lest it risk retaliation against the US firms that are increasingly betting on the country’s gas. “Mozambique has become much more strategic to the United States,” he said.","14.01.2019"
"Moral Money special: UN green roof, protesters and what’s ahead","Your guide to the investment and business revolution you can’t afford to ignore","Welcome to Moral Money’s second day of UN climate week coverage.
 Here’s a quick recap of Monday’s action. Greta Thunberg slammed the UN: “We will never forgive you”. Ms Thunberg and her supporters sued five countries for ignoring the risks of global warming for “decades” and worsened the climate crisis. President Emmanuel Macron said France would not pursue new trade negotiations with countries that were not following the Paris climate agreement, adding that doing so would be “deeply hypocritical”.

A sobering survey shows the trade-offs CEOs face This week has seen a series of business-led initiatives to try to accelerate progress towards the UN’s sustainable development goals. But a survey released on Tuesday points to a striking level of unease among chief executives about how effective their efforts have been so far. The 1,000-person poll by the UN Global Compact and Accenture, billed as the world’s largest corporate sustainability study, finds that just one in five corporate leaders around the world believes that business is making a critical contribution to the global goals, and under half are integrating sustainability into their operations. The high point for business commitment on sustainability came, it concludes, in 2016.  As the world takes stock this week of its progress towards the goals, “it is a pretty bleak picture”, says Lise Kingo, chief executive of the UN Global Compact, the corporate sustainability initiative which counts more than 13,500 signatories. “We are not seeing the needle move.” The task now, she says, is for companies to back up their statements on purpose by integrating it into their operations “in a much more ambitious way”. “The global goals are not on track and the Paris climate summit has not delivered the quality of business action that we needed,” says Peter Lacy, senior managing director of Accenture Strategy. More than half of the chiefs polled said they were being held back by trade-offs between long-term investment and short-term cost pressures. Chief executives have also been blown off course by socio-economic, geopolitical and technological uncertainties in the past four years, the report concludes, but there are glimmers of hope. As Kingo notes, two-thirds of CEOs now say that they are personally driving their companies’ sustainability agenda. “That was not how responsible business was seen 10 years ago,” she says. (Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson) Modi unveils a green roof at the UN  Narendra Modi will cut the ribbon to declare 'Gandhi Solar Park' open  © Bloomberg The UN is used to being accused of emitting hot air. From today it will have a new defence to such charges: a sustainable roof combining 11,000 sq ft of solar panels and a similar area of plants that should cool the ambient air by up to 6 degrees.  The project has been funded by India’s mission to the UN, and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi will cut the ribbon to declare “Gandhi Solar Park” open today, chiming with the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth and with India’s renewable energy push.  The roof was installed by Adaptive Green, a four-year-old certified B Corp, at a cost of $500,000 excluding the engineers and architects’ fees. Sulman Usman, the company’s CEO, told Moral Money he had seen the “green roof” market grow by 50 per cent in the past three years and expected further growth now that New York has passed a “green new deal” that will require green, solar or wind power roofs on new developments in the next four years. The UN’s new roof is designed to generate 88,000 kWh of electricity and save another 3,300 kWh each year. It will also absorb about 207,000 gallons of storm water, helping with another problem familiar to UN-goers. As Usman notes: “New York spills an inordinate amount of raw sewage into the East River.” (Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson) Pounding the pavement © Billy Nauman The protests on Monday in front of the offices of BNP Paribas did not look impressive at first glance, but as the launch event for the UN principles of responsible banking started to roll it was clear they had got their anti-greenwashing message across.  As we mentioned yesterday, activists including the Rainforest Action Network, 350.org and BankTrack are concerned that the principles would be used as nothing more than a way for these banks to burnish their public image while abdicating responsibility for fighting climate change and continuing to finance the world’s largest polluters. Speaking to numerous bank executives at the event, it was clear the protesters’ presence had touched a nerve. “Why are they protesting [against] us? Why are they not protesting the banks that did not sign?” one incredulous banker asked. His point is well taken. Of all the big US banks, only Citigroup has signed the accord. However, the activists argue their job is to keep the signatories honest. If the principles become simply a means of greenwashing, it does no service to the banks that are making real change. After a panel moderated by Moral Money’s Billy Nauman, one activist in the crowd stood up to call attention to the fact that only one of the roughly two dozen bank bosses who had taken the stage had mentioned fossil fuels. And the activists were also protesting against non-signatories as well. After the demonstration at the BNP Paribas offices they made their way to JPMorgan Chase.  Banks are not their only target either. On Sunday night they staked out oil executives dining at the Gramercy Park Hotel and tomorrow they head to BlackRock’s headquarters. (Billy Nauman) Tesco calls for disclosure of food waste © Andrew Parsons / i-Images At this year’s UN General Assembly meeting, it is not just finance groups jumping into the fray; the food industry is also scrambling in response to investor pressure. On Tuesday, a group of global retailers, suppliers and agricultural companies known as “12.3” are announcing measures to hit the UN sustainable development goal’s target to cut food waste by half in 2030 (with a dire lack of imagination, 12.3 represents this target’s number on the official UN SDG list). Cutting waste is important to tackle hunger, the group says, given that one in nine people are going hungry today and about a third of all food is wasted. However — as Dave Lewis, chief executive of UK supermarket chain Tesco and head of 12.3, stresses — the other issue is greenhouse gases.  “If food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet,” he said. So the 12.3 group wants 10 leading retailers — including Tesco, Walmart and Ahold — to slash food waste in their own operations and those of 20 of their biggest suppliers by 2030. It will be interesting to see whether this target can be reached (not least because one interesting detail about this plan is that it has a high proportion of participation from American suppliers and retailers). Lewis thinks that mandatory reporting will be needed in a country such as the UK to hit these targets. “The government has indicated it will introduce mandatory reporting and we call on them to do this urgently,” he said. However, the UK is not the only place where there is much work to do: the group says that at present out “of the world’s 50 largest food companies, more than two-thirds have set targets in line with SDG 12.3, more than 40 per cent are measuring their food loss and waste, and just one-third are pursuing actions at scale to reduce waste in their own operations”. Shareholders flex their muscles Some of the world’s largest asset owners have come together to set an ambitious target for the companies they own: net zero carbon by 2050.  The coalition includes Calpers, the largest US pension fund, the insurer Allianz, France’s Caisse des Dépôts Group and nine other asset owners with a total of $2.4tn under management. Its members, which have teamed up with the UN Economic Programme, insist this isn’t just another toothless initiative. They plan to use their monetary heft to create “real world impact”, says Günther Thallinger, a member of Allianz’s board and its head of environmental, social and governance investing. As part of the pledge, the group is committing to set out a list of intermediary milestones to hit before 2050, and publicly disclose their progress. Calpers has already identified 100 companies out of the 11,000 that it owns a share of that are responsible for almost three-quarters of their overall emissions, said director of board governance Anne Simpson. And getting those companies to reduce their carbon output is a matter of fiduciary duty, she said. However, this group knows it cannot go it alone. Part of their initiative is to recruit other big investors to their cause and to try to influence public policy. The members of the alliance are not just “wagging our finger and waiting for the government to act”, said Ms Simpson. “It’s a sack race and we’re all in the same sack.” (Billy Nauman)
 On the radar It’s hard to keep up with all the announcements coming out. Here are a few more that we spotted today: The maritime shipping industry is pushing to reduce its total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent of 2008 levels by 2050. The “Getting to Zero Coalition”, an association of shipping groups, is committed to getting commercially viable deep-sea, zero-emission vessels on the seas by 2030.
Credit Suisse and the Climate Bonds Initiative, a not-for-profit, are partnering on a sustainable transition bond market. The aim of the partnership is to broaden the green bond market to include sustainable development bonds for companies that might be looking to finance a transition away from single-use plastic packaging, among other things.
BNP Paribas is upping its efforts to preserve the oceans. The French banking giant said it was committing €1bn by 2025 to finance the ecological transition of ships, such as dual-fuel liquefied natural gas propulsion projects.

"Will US company results neutralise ‘earnings recession’ fears?","The key questions for investors in the week ahead","Will US company results neutralise ‘earnings recession’ fears?
 An “earnings recession” could be looming for the US stock market. Analysts estimate that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 index of blue-chip stocks contracted 4.6 per cent in the first three months of the year, and they forecast that they will shrink another 0.4 per cent in the second quarter. If these estimates prove true it would technically constitute what some analysts term an earnings recession. However, the initial spate of first-quarter results from US companies indicate that these fears may not come to pass. The large US banks that typically lead earnings season have outperformed estimates. JPMorgan even delivered the best quarterly profit on record for a US bank, hauling $9.1bn in profits, comfortably beating Wall Street’s predictions.  Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse said the convention of companies downplaying anticipated results to soften analyst estimates before comfortably beating them further reduces the likelihood of an earnings recession. “Assuming historical heads, earnings per share should actually expand 2.5 per cent in the first quarter,” Mr Golub said. Given the strong stock market recovery of 2019, a scenario where corporate earnings remain robust would constitute a major fillip to investors. But if the coming week of results disappoint, then markets could prove vulnerable to a setback. Richard Henderson
 What does hotpot stock say about Chinese stimulus measures?
 When looking for a standout success story in Chinese retail, you could do worse than Haidilao Hotpot, a Chinese restaurant group, whose stock is up 68 per cent since its October float in Hong Kong.  The rise is not just down to the restaurant’s mouth-watering morsels. Chinese retail more broadly is experiencing an uplift, with the Hang Seng Consumer Goods & Services Index rising 23 per cent this year so far. The reason why has a lot to do with Beijing’s latest raft of measures to stimulate the economy. Previous rounds of stimulus in 2008 and 2015 were focused on China’s old-growth, state-owned enterprises and infrastructure projects. This time Beijing has won praise for focusing much more on the private sector with measures like a Rmb2tn (almost $300bn) in value added tax cut to help corporations and smaller businesses cut costs and invest more. The goal is to boost consumption, which now accounts for more than half of gross domestic product. Ben Luk, senior multi-asset strategist for global markets at State Street, said that was good news for stocks that were consumer and technology orientated — “all things geared toward the domestic demand story”. The downside for the rest of Asia, Mr Luk said, is less stimulus will spill over to industries in other countries linked to Chinese infrastructure spending and real estate, which got a boost from earlier stimulus packages. The likes of Korean shipbuilders and Australian iron ore miners, for instance, will have to look elsewhere for a pick-me-up. But for Haidilao and other consumer-focused companies, the stimulus means more Chinese consumers with pocketbooks thick enough to feel comfortable dining out, rather than fretting over every cent spent. Hudson Lockett
 Can oily currencies keep on rising?
 A rebound in oil prices has provided a boost to currencies of commodity-exporting countries, with the Russian rouble notching up more than 8 per cent gains against the dollar so far this year. The Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone have been relative laggards despite a 43 per cent rise in oil prices this year.  The underperformance of the krone, which has so far picked up only 1.4 per cent against the dollar and 3 per cent against the euro, makes the Nordic currency the most likely to benefit from further strength in oil. The krone is also set to benefit from the Norwegian’s central bank’s hawkish stance, as policymakers raised rates at their March meeting to 1 per cent and said that another rise in the second part of the year is still pencilled in. “[The Norges Bank is] one of few hawkish central bank stories we can talk about in the G10,” said Jordan Rochester, an FX strategist at Nomura. “It’s an oil play, we can’t deny that, but at least has central bank pricing to support it too.” The Canadian dollar also appears to be heading for further gains, albeit potentially more modest than the krone as it lacks the support from a hawkish central bank. The Bank of Canada is teetering on the edge of cutting its key rate of 1.75 per cent in the coming months with the next meeting scheduled for April 24.  “Overall, we judge that there is potentially more catch-up strength ahead for the Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone from the higher price of oil,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at Japanese bank MUFG. Eva Szalay

"Risk temperature at boiling point","Mike Mackenzie’s daily analysis of what’s moving global markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email. As talks over trade between the US and China begin in Washington, the temperature has risen to a critical level. China’s message of retaliating with “necessary countermeasures” should the US raise tariffs on Friday, has duly heightened anxiety among traders and investors.    A more alarming market reaction to date has only been prevented by the binary outcome of either bad news or some light at the end of the tunnel dawning on Friday. In other words, risk aversion either boils over or starts cooling off. Equities and sectors exposed to global trade (US technology, materials and industrials along with eurozone carmakers and miners) have certainly suffered this week, but the scale of the selling has been restrained by the risk of a positive development that cools the temperature and sparks a classic “relief” trade. There was a taste of this on Thursday as Wall Street bounced from its lows as Mr Trump spoke at the White House and said a deal was still possible, while adding: “I have no idea what’s going to happen. We’re going to find out about China tonight.” Currencies are usually in the vanguard of big market shifts and it’s worth keeping an eye on China’s renminbi and the Japanese yen in particular. China’s onshore currency on Thursday weakened to Rmb6.8071, its lowest level against the US dollar since January.  Last year when trade tension was notably driving the anxiety factor, the Rmb headed towards the 7 area, long seen as a line in the sand for markets. Not since 2008 has the currency been that weak versus the US dollar and holding this level has been seen as desirable in terms of preventing capital flight from China and sparking a damaging wave of currency devaluations that would ripple across emerging markets. Understandably, concern within foreign exchange circles is building that higher US tariffs will propel the Rmb towards that marker and beyond. If we see that, things will get very messy in the markets.  The concern over the Rmb’s near-term direction is illustrated by a stunning rise in implied volatility alongside a surge in demand for hedging against the risk of a much weaker currency.  Mandy Xu at Credit Suisse points out that currency volatility for the Rmb versus the US dollar was trading at its lowest in a year last week, only to “have since surged to a near 1-year high”. Another eye-catching shift has taken place in one-month currency risk reversals, an area that until the recent six month delay over Brexit was dominated by the UK pound. In very short time, the demand for options that become profitable from a much weaker Rmb over the next month in both the onshore and offshore markets has risen above their respective 2018 peaks. The offshore risk reversal shown below loiters near its February 2018 peak of 1.43 after US tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels and washing machines were introduced. At a current level of 1.375, a test of the 2016 peak above 4 remains well out of bounds at this stage.    This is one market to definitely watch over the coming hours and Mandy highlights the scale of uncertainty facing the market: “While we think risk is still tilted to the downside ahead of tomorrow’s tariff deadline, the situation is fast moving and we could be one tweet away from a major reversal.” Hardly reassuring is the point raised by Deutsche Bank’s George Saravelos that shifts between the USD and Rmb “have been fairly consistently in line with the weighted average tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports”. As the bank shows via this table: “The new 25% tariff on $200bn of goods will bring average tariffs to 12% — commensurate with USD/CNH above 7 to offset the impact.”  In turn, DB also highlight how the Rmb is among the most expensive currencies in their view, while the Japanese yen sits at the other end of the spectrum as shown here:  So one likely reaction from a trade impasse and the imposition of higher tariffs would involve selling the Rmb versus the yen. The fallout would also extend to China growth proxies, the Australian dollar and the Korean won, two currencies that this week have touched multiyear lows and sit on the expensive side of the DB valuation wheel. In terms of protecting investment portfolios from the gathering storm between the US and China over trade, holding exposure to the yen is a popular call.  As UBS write: “The undervaluation of the Japanese yen, along with its tendency to appreciate when global risk aversion increases, makes the yen an attractive countercyclical position.” And from Market Forces yesterday, that extends to owning top-tier government bonds, which leaves Italy off the list. The 10-year BTP yield is 7 basis points higher on Thursday, while the 10-year German Bund sits at minus 0.05 per cent. In the US, the 10-year Treasury yield briefly dropped below that of the three-month T-bill, the first inversion since March and another sign of fragile sentiment.  Be ready when the London market opens, with Cat Rutter Pooley’s Opening Quote report. Sign up here

 Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar One sliver of light on trade — Here’s an interesting line from the FT’s coverage of the trade showdown and one that may provide some breathing room for markets. Higher US tariffs would apply to products exported from China starting on Friday and not goods that are already in transit. As the FT writes:  “The clarification offers US and Chinese negotiators a window of two to four weeks to reach a deal before the bulk of the pain from the higher tariffs hits US consumers and businesses, based on shipping times between the countries.” Investors debate who holds the trade war cards — President Trump, some argue, can push for higher tariffs with the ensuing hit to markets and the US economy offset by the likelihood of the Federal Reserve and other central banks cutting rates. The argument favouring China playing a longer game from here is that they can wait until the 2020 US presidential election for starters, while they have already begun the process of diversifying away from the US towards other trading partners. A popular view remains that for all the political posturing, it serves the interests of both the US and China not to prompt a major bout of market turmoil that in turn weighs on broader economic activity. Others take comfort that so long as the US and China keep talking, irrespective of tariffs rising on Friday, the path is open towards an eventual agreement. Analysts at Citi sum up the consensus thinking:  “Trump’s renewed tariff threat is likely being used as part of a strategy to cement concessions from China. Citi’s base case remains for a trade deal in 2Q.” That raises the question of just what kind of agreement is feasible and more importantly will it stand up over time. Mr Trump and US trade hawks have plenty of company and heading into the 2020 election cycle, getting tough with China is a vote winner. The president’s approval rating via Gallup has climbed to its highest level for his presidency at 46 per cent. And beyond China, the US has yet to apply the pressure on Germany and the eurozone. The fallout from higher US tariffs beyond China — Société Générale believes the pain will resonate in Taiwan and Korea, while India looks a better place to build equity exposure. “According to our economists, 17% and 14% of this tranche of China exports ($267bn) consist of mobile phones and laptops respectively. And Taiwan and Korea are among the two countries with the highest value-added contribution to Chinese exports to the US (respectively 2.2% and 1.3% of GDP). In that environment, India equities would be the Asia outperformer.” US small-caps are no port in the storm — The two main US benchmarks for smaller listed companies, the S&P 600 and Russell 2000 both sit 10 per cent below their record peaks of late August 2018, but they have slightly outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. One view is that small-caps are insulated from global headwinds due to their domestic focus. But broad market stress that results in wider credit spreads or higher borrowing costs matters for small-caps and as DataTrek point out: “The spreads for BB-or-worse US corporate debt over Treasuries are currently 3.89 percentage points. That is higher than any point in 2018, even if it is lower than late December 2018’s +5.00 percentage points.” Buying small-caps as a defensive strategy in the event that larger more globally orientated larger US companies suffer from escalating trade tension runs the risk of backfiring as greater macro stress likely results in wider credit spreads.  Keep up to date with the top M&A stories, sharp analysis and insight on the dealmakers —

"Stocks to watch: Bunzl, Mediclinic, Burberry, Moncler, AJ Bell, SSE","Jewellery makers look the best value among luxury goods stocks, says Bernstein","Wednesday 11:00 BST What’s happening ● Bunzl, the disposables distributor, was the FTSE 100’s sharpest faller on a weaker than expected first-quarter trading update. Organic growth totalled just 1.5 per cent, from 4.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter, which management blamed on “mixed macroeconomic and market conditions”. North America was the biggest problem, with organic growth of just 1 per cent due to lower volumes to the grocery and retail sectors as well as a lack of product price inflation. “While we expected lower organic growth for the full year 2019 compared to 2018 following softer macro trends and tougher [year-on-year comparisons] in the first quarter in the US owing to a previous business win, the slowdown is bigger than expected. We also note that the lower growth could pose a moderate downside risk to our margin assumptions in North America following negative operational leverage.Goldman Sachs ● Mediclinic rallied in response to a reassuring trading update. The private hospital operator said earnings per share for its full year to end-March would be “around 27p”, slightly above the 26.5p consensus. Another source of reassurance came with news that lenders had agreed to loosen the covenants on Mediclinic’s Swiss business to reflect the impact of regulatory moves, with no change to interest rates on the debt. Margins at the Swiss business, which contributes about half of Mediclinic’s operating earnings and had been the focus of recent investor concerns, were slightly better than hoped at 16 per cent. “Guidance for South Africa and the Middle East was weaker than expected and will likely require cuts to earnings [forecasts], but we would expect the positive news on Switzerland to outweigh the negatives elsewhere . . . We still think conditions will be tough in Switzerland in coming periods, but the doomsday scenario would now appear less likely.”JPMorgan Cazenove Sellside stories ● Bernstein Research started coverage of Burberry with an “underperform” rating and £17.25 target price in a global sector review. Luca Solca, consistently the sector’s top-rated analyst while at Exane BNP Paribas, argued that the market was justified in pricing in a favourable outcome both for Chinese consumer confidence and US-China trade talks. But brands were polarising between those that could attract young consumers who seek novelty and those that sold through “cookie cutter retail networks” and print media and fashion shows that were “a relic of the past”, he said. Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Moncler have “had the courage to innovate” and are thriving, while Ferragamo and Tod’s were struggling having failed to do so, Bernstein said. “In between, there are a number of brands that are trying hard to catch up with the first group, but have so far fallen short of this task — Prada and Burberry.” Bernstein also argued that the need for tight marketing and retailing strategies was favouring the mega brands over their smaller, autocratically managed rivals.  “This increasingly complicated competitive landscape rewards larger groups, with well-structured senior management organisations — able to win when it comes to recruit, promote and retain top talent — with pockets deep enough to fund adequate resources on all of these fronts . . .  LVMH and Kering stand out in this respect — with more traditional, family dependent companies at the opposite end of the spectrum.bernstein The broker saw jewellery makers and “hard luxury” companies as the best value so advised buying Richemont, EssilorLuxottica and Tiffany. LVMH and Hermes were the sector’s high quality plays while Moncler and Gucci owner Kering were most attractive in terms of trading momentum, but valuations had already risen close to the long-term average so “market perform” ratings were appropriate, Bernstein said. It also rated Prada “market perform” on valuation grounds, even though like Burberry its attempts at reinvention “still seem far off the mark”. Farfetch, the US online retailer, was rated “underperform” on expectations that suppliers will increasingly want to control their own sales portals. “It is clearly not in the long-term interest of major brands to favour the growth of a winner takes all platform,” Bernstein said. ● In brief: AJ Bell rated new “neutral” at Macquarie; Ackermans upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Alcon rated new “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Altice Europe rated new “neutral” at Citigroup; Antofagasta cut to “market perform” at Bernstein; Biophytis downgraded to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Brenntag raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Demant upgraded to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; D’Ieteren upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; EDP Renováveis raised to “buy” at Société Générale; GTT cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Heineken upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; IMCD cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Intertrust raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Repsol upgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Rio Tinto downgraded to “hold” at Investec; SSE rated new “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Saint-Gobain rated new “neutral” at Citigroup; Sampo upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Tele Columbus upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays; Valmet downgraded to “sell” at Berenberg.

"Charles Schwab and Fidelity intensify battle for ETF business  ","Groups double the number of funds that can be traded free of commission","The cut-throat price war involving exchange traded funds escalated on Tuesday after Charles Schwab and Fidelity simultaneously announced that they would offer more commission-free ETF trading.  Schwab said it would double the number of ETFs that can be traded without paying a commission on its OneSource platform to more than 500. Boston-based rival Fidelity has a matching offer after expanding its commission-free ETF platform for individual investors and advisers from 265 ETFs to more than 500.  The price cuts by Schwab and Fidelity underline the growing importance of ETF trading for online brokers. Leading ETF managers are ferociously competing for business by reducing annual management fees. The battle has spread into offering ETF trading at zero cost in the hope that clients can be sold other products.   “The more customers [online brokers] can attract, the more commission-free ETFs their clients will buy,” said Martin Small, head of US iShares at BlackRock.  Investors will be able to buy 90 BlackRock iShares ETFs commission-free on Schwab’s platform for the first time from March. Its commission-free line-up includes more ETFs from Invesco, State Street, WisdomTree, Standard Life Aberdeen, Alps Advisors, Direxion, Global X, John Hancock, JPMorgan Asset Management and Pimco.  Schwab views its offer of commission-free ETFs from multiple providers as a way to stimulate investor interest in its own-brand ETFs. Investor inflows into the OneSource platform totalled $22.8bn last year, accounting for half of the total ETF flows at Schwab in 2018. Fidelity’s move follows its decision in 2018 to launch a range of index-tracking mutual funds that carried zero management fees. That initiative represented the group’s most determined response to competition from Vanguard, which has a reputation as the industry’s most aggressive competitor on fund fees.  “The race to zero with equity trading commissions will continue,” said an analyst who asked not to be named.  He said growth in commission-free ETF trading would force rival brokers to focus more on generating profits from managing cash balances held by clients and receiving payment for order flow.   The moves by Schwab and Fidelity are also a response to the launch of a new e-broker service by JPMorgan Asset Management. That service, branded as You Invest, provides clients with 100 free stock or ETF trades in their first year and undercuts competitors by reducing the base equity trading commission rate to $2.95 a trade.  JPMorgan already provides financial services to an army of wealthy US retail investors. Analysts expect the You Invest initiative to strengthen its position against online brokers including E*Trade Financial and TD Ameritrade.  The escalation in price competition has prompted speculation that E*Trade Financial could be vulnerable to a takeover bid.  Credit Suisse analysts said last year that potential buyers, such as Schwab and TD Ameritrade, may offer a lower bid for E*Trade Financial if they believed that the brokers’ price war would drive trading commission rates even lower.

  Sometimes it’s nice to take a step back from the frantic pace of the M&A game and reflect on whether a deal was even worth it.  There are the obvious examples of unbelievable dealmaking — think Google’s acquisition of YouTube or Facebook’s purchase of Instagram. And then there are the obvious trainwrecks. General Electric’s shopping spree over the past decade comes to mind.  And then there are times where it’s a bit more complicated. That is how we like to think about Anheuser-Busch InBev’s $122bn deal to purchase London-listed SABMiller.  The deal, which was agreed in October 2015 and completed a year later, remains endlessly fascinating to DD.  First there’s the fact that it created the world’s most dominant brewer, producing one in four beers globally. Then there was the fact that deal fees touched $2bn.  And behind all of that, you have the shareholders.  On the AB InBev side, the list includes the trio of Brazilian billionaires that founded 3G Capital and some secretive super-rich Belgian families.  For SABMiller, there were Colombia’s billionaire 
Santo Domingo family and US-listed tobacco group Altria, which makes Marlboro smokes.  The latter took unlisted stock in the combined entity with the hopes of getting rich off a deal to create “Megabrew” and reap the benefits of the ruthless synergy chasing ways of AB InBev.  Together, the Brazilians, the Belgians, the Colombians and the tobacco floggers control over 50 per cent of AB InBev. So far, so grand right?  Nope. As we’ve chronicled, things took an ugly turn at AB InBev, with its stock peaking about three years ago.  Since then it has had to deal with a declining share price, huge debt load, weaker demand for beer in the US and a poor run in emerging market currencies that has damped the positive effects of the deal.  Here’s how the company has responded:  Cut its dividend in half after reporting weak profits.

Board shake-up: Martin Barrington, the former chief executive of cigarette maker Altria, was brought in to replace Olivier Goudet as chairman; and 3G’s managing partner Alexandre Behring left the board. 

Pursued asset sales and an ill-fated IPO that may eventually come back. 

 This week AB InBev sold its Australian business to Japan’s Asahi. This prompted us to ask whether the SABMiller deal made sense in the first place. The assets it has sold off from the SABMiller portfolio are the focus of the graphic below.  The legacy of the SABMiller deal is the subject of this piece by DD’s Arash Massoudi and the FT’s Leila Abboud. If you have any thoughts or insights on the deal, email us at due.diligence@ft.com. Wyelands Bank: Growing GFG together One of the more puzzling stories in European corporate finance has been the rise of Sanjeev Gupta — an Indian-born entrepreneur who has transformed himself from a relatively obscure metals trader into one of the UK’s leading industrialists through a string of acquisitions.   
  The rapid expansion of what the charismatic businessman calls the “GFG Alliance” — a collection of loosely associated (mostly) metals businesses that Gupta’s family has invested in — has left many in the City wondering how the entrepreneur is funding the endless flow of deals. A big part of Gupta’s secret sauce has been his close relationship to a financial wizard of Oz called Lex Greensill, an Australian financier and close confidant of former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, whose eponymous firm recently bagged a huge investment from 
SoftBank.  Greensill and Gupta were dragged into the scandal at GAM due to illiquid investments that the Swiss asset manager made in projects linked to the two financiers. The Indian industrialist recently helped GAM close that messy chapter by buying back its remaining positions. The FT has now lifted the lid on another important source of financing for GFG: a UK bank controlled by Gupta that takes retail deposits. Our investigation has revealed that Gupta’s Wyelands Bank — named after the Welsh country estate he owns with his wife — has provided extensive financing to the GFG Alliance.    
  We recommend that you read the full deep dive here to get up to speed, particularly as Gupta’s deal spree shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. Don’t worry Sun, this too shall pass 
Justin Sun had an important date coming up on Thursday.  The 29-year-old founder of the Tron crypto-token and chief executive of BitTorrent (bear with us) was going to sit down with legendary investor Warren Buffett. Yes, really.  Sun paid over $4.5m at an annual charity auction to have lunch with the Oracle of Omaha. He’d been hoping to school Buffett on the wonders of crypto.   The same Buffett, that is, who earlier this year called bitcoin “rat poison squared”. (For the record, DD agrees.) But for now, Buffett has been spared.  Sun can no longer make the highly anticipated lunch because he’s come down with kidney stones. Or, at least, that’s what we were told by Tron’s Twitter feed late on Monday.  The kidney stone excuse didn’t seem to pass muster with the crypto crowd, however. Tron declined by 16 per cent after the announcement was made. Maybe they knew something we didn’t?  Chinese media has reported that Sun has been prevented from leaving China because he’s accused of illegal fundraising and running illegal gambling services. Sun is sticking to the stone story.  What better way to convince a crypto sceptic that cryptocurrencies are legit than being accused by the Chinese government of illegal fundraising?  Alphaville’s Jemima Kelly has the full story.  Job moves FT exclusive: Royal Bank of Scotland has approached the head of HSBC’s UK operations about becoming its next chief executive, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Ian Stuart is among the preferred external candidates to replace Ross McEwan at RBS, which is majority-owned by the UK government, the people said. More here. 

Bank of America and UBS have reshuffled their investment banking teams in a bid to muscle in on fundraising and advisory work for private companies, as fees from initial public offerings come under pressure. The trend is explained here. 

Rothschild & Co has hired two managing directors to join its global advisory business in New York. Markus Pressdee, who was previously a managing director at Aecom Capital, will lead the company’s North America infrastructure, power and renewables business. Steven Berger, a former director in Credit Suisse’s financial institutions group, will cover asset management in Rothschild’s FIG group.

"Stocks to watch: Constellation Brands, Softcat, Axel Springer, Kier","Possibility of US rate cut puts HSBC forecasts at risk, says Barclays","Wednesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● Constellation Brands plunged in US pre-market trading on a profit warning. The maker of Corona lager and Meiomi wine cut full-year earnings-per-share guidance to $9.20-$9.30 from $9.60-$9.75 to reflect a weaker outlook for wine, as well as higher interest expenses linked to its $4bn investment last year in Canopy Growth, the Canadian cannabis grower.  Third-quarter EPS from Constellation of $2.37 beat a $2.06 consensus thanks largely to a lower than expected tax rate, though beer volume growth was also better than analysts had predicted due largely to shipment timings. ● Taylor Wimpey led a rally for the UK housebuilders after a reassuring pre-close update. The group said full-year results would match expectations with completions up 3 per cent and average selling prices holding steady. On the outlook, management said: “Whilst it is clearly too early to give a definitive view on 2019 trading, we continue to see solid forward sales indicators and start the year with a very strong order book.” ● Ted Baker rebounded after reporting improved high street trading over Christmas, with the fashion label growing retail sales by 12.2 per cent over the five weeks to early January. The company kept full-year guidance unchanged and cautioned that margins had suffered as, due to a slow start to the autumn-winter season, it had to clear stock. There was no update on an independent investigation into allegations against Ted Baker chief executive Ray Kelvin, who took a voluntary leave of absence in December. ● Softcat surged to a three-month high after the IT group said in a brief statement that trading had remained strong since its previous update in November, meaning its fiscal first-half was “now materially ahead of where we expected to be at this stage of the year”. “This is clearly very positive, although the lack of specific commentary on full-year expectation highlights the challenges for everyone in knowing how to extrapolate momentum in the current environment . . . January is one of the seasonally strongest trading months of the first half and [year-on-year] comparisons harden in the second half. Consequently, we . . . remain prudent. However, the positive tone to the statement leads us to upgrade 2019 and 2020 EPS by 5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.”Credit Suisse Sellside stories ● Barclays downgraded HSBC to “underweight” from “equal weight” with a 640p price target, cut from 740p. It cited trade tensions and weakening Hong Kong residential property prices, as well as asset pricing risks given that markets have priced a 40 per cent chance of a US rate cut in 2019. The broker also highlighted recent weakness of the renminbi and sterling against the dollar, which it said was not yet in consensus expectations.  “We still like its long-term growth story and recognise HSBC as a relative safe haven in difficult markets with a 6 per cent cash yield and diverse earnings. However, we see downside to consensus earnings on weaker China, an inverted US [yield] curve and foreign exchange movements, and an expensive valuation.”Barclays At 11 times 2020 earnings, HSBC trades at a 35 per cent premium to European peers, its highest valuation since 2011, Barclays added. Its 2019 banking sector outlook repeated “overweight” ratings on Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland based on “depressed valuations and potential for a constructive Brexit outcome”. ● Liberum restarted coverage of Kier, the construction services group, with a “buy” rating and 660p target price.  “Kier has a complicated but robust model. Its combination of businesses should result in stable earnings and a resilient balance sheet. Hedge funds have sowed doubts over accounting and the post-Carillion world has proved fertile ground. However, we estimate crude cash conversion of 102 per cent over eight years, which is all the assurance we need.”Liberum ● UBS upgraded German publisher Axel Springer to “buy” from “neutral” on valuation grounds.  Axel has derated from 21 times current-year earnings in early 2018 to just 16 times earnings on concern about cyclicality and margin pressure at its classifieds business, said UBS. The broker said those concerns were valid and expected profit growth to be muted, however it argued that Axel’s underlying discount of 50 per cent to peers was too much. The broker also argued that Axel would unlock €2 of value per share if its Business Insider website hit long-term margin targets.  ● In brief: AMS downgraded to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; ADO Properties upgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Auto Trader rated “hold” at Jefferies; BHP downgraded to “sell” at Deutsche Bank; Abcam upgraded to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Eni upgraded to “buy” at Berenberg; Essity raised to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Fraport upgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Fresenius SE raised to “neutral” at UBS; LafargeHolcim upgraded to “neutral” at Davy; MedicX cut to “sell” at Stifel; Medios rated “buy” at Berenberg; Prudential downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; Saint-Gobain downgraded to “neutral” at Davy; SSE upgraded to “outperform” at Bernstein; Scout24 raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Serco upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup and Shore Capital; Zurich Airport upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays; Zurich Insurance upgraded to “hold” at SocGen.

"Son of Mozambique ex-president arrested in loans scandal","Loans financed tuna fishing fleet but funds diverted to kickback, say US prosecutors","The son of former Mozambique president Armando Guebuza has been arrested in connection with the Southern African country’s $2bn hidden loans scandal that led last month to US corruption charges. Ndambi Guebuza, the eldest son of the former leader who stepped down in 2015, was detained in Maputo, the capital, on Saturday, according to local media. During Mr Guebuza’s presidency, Mozambique sold debts on international markets that were concealed from its parliament and the IMF.  The loans ostensibly financed a state tuna fishing fleet and maritime security projects but funds were diverted to kickbacks for government officials, according to US prosecutors who unveiled charges last month. The arrest of Ndambi Guebuza, a businessman, is the most high-profile under the rule of President Filipe Nyusi. The US case has exposed his government’s failure to prosecute anyone over one of Africa’s biggest corruption cases in recent times.
 The scandal plunged Mozambique into an economic crisis when the discovery of the loans prompted the IMF and donors to cut financial ties. It is still trying to restructure the defaulted debts. Last month’s US indictment accused Mr Guebuza’s former finance minister, Manuel Chang, of a conspiracy to siphon at least $200m in kickbacks for officials from the loans, which went to dubious companies owned by the intelligence service. Three former Credit Suisse bankers were also accused of fraud, bribery and money-laundering in connection with the loans, as was an agent of Privinvest, the Abu Dhabi-based shipbuilder which equipped the projects. Neither the Swiss bank nor Privinvest were charged. According to US prosecutors, an unnamed relative of a senior Mozambican official also received at least $9.7m in bribes.  Neither Mr Guebuza nor his son could be reached for comment. Mr Chang was arrested at Johannesburg’s international airport in December after a US request to South African authorities. He was denied bail last week by a South African judge who said that he had hidden a full picture of his finances from the court. Mozambique is opposing Mr Chang’s extradition to the US. Officially, the government has argued that he should be returned home to face other corruption cases.  There is a widespread suspicion, however, that as a loyal ally of Mr Guebuza within Frelimo, Mozambique’s ruling party, Mr Chang will be released in Mozambique soon after any return from South Africa, and that arrests of other individuals tied to the case are a figleaf to justify South Africa handing him over. Last week, Mozambique also detained the former chief of the intelligence service, the head of state companies linked to the loans and other officials who served Mr Guebuza — indicating how far the scandal reaches into the heart of the ruling Frelimo party. The arrests “will never go to trial”, said Joseph Hanlon, a Mozambique expert at the Open University. “They’re making arrests to show in a South African court that people can be detained,” he added. With national elections due in October, Mozambican authorities have otherwise shown little tolerance for criticism of the ruling party in the light of the US case.  Last month, police blocked public demonstrations against paying back the debt and called demands for justice an “attempt to agitate the people”.","17.02.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Activision, AB InBev, Taylor Wimpey, Sage, UDG","Reliable dividends make the UK housebuilders look cheap, says Merrill Lynch","Friday 13:30 GMT What’s happening ● Activision Blizzard dropped in US pre-market trading after announcing that Bungie, its privately owned partner, would assume full publishing rights and responsibilities for the Destiny video game franchise. Activision, which had flagged in a recent earnings call that management was unhappy with the franchise, said to expect no material revenue or operating income from the games in the future. Merrill Lynch estimated that losing the Destiny titles would be a $400m headwind for Activision revenues this year, reducing earnings per share to $2.48 from $2.73. With the loss, 2019 is “looking more like an earnings reset year”, it said. But Macquarie argued that investors should be looking at 2020 for the benefits of Activision’s strategy to concentrate on owned intellectual property. While Destiny was never particularly meaningful to Activision because Bungie was taking a reported 20-35 per cent of operating profits plus bonuses, its loss leaves the group with Call of Duty as its one meaningful franchise and raises the possibility for a significant acquisition, the broker said. ● Stobart Group was the FTSE 250’s biggest gainer after the operator of Southend Airport agreed to rescue Flybe, its main customer. Stobart and Virgin Atlantic said they had reached an agreement with Flybe management to buy the regional airline at just 1p per share, a 93 per cent discount to Thursday’s closing price. ● AB InBev gained on reports that the brewer was considering floating its Asia-Pacific operations to cut debt by about $5bn. Bernstein argued that the spin-off would warrant a higher valuation multiple to peers, given that about a third of its $3bn in operating profits came from China and other emerging markets last year. Though a mooted valuation of $70bn looks optimistic, any partial float would be likely to make the rest of InBev look even more attractively valued, it said. The broker also argued that InBev would benefit from having a new avenue to raise cash and shore up its balance sheet in case of another Latin American currency crisis. Sellside stories ● Merrill Lynch upgraded Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon to “buy” from “underperform”, as well as moving to a “neutral” stance on the UK housebuilding sector.  Valuations are low, having already priced in a 10 per cent fall in house prices, and dividends look robust, Merrill said. It estimated that allowing for underlying assets and land banks, the sector was trading about equal to its true net asset value, a 20 per cent to 25 per cent discount to historical levels. Merrill forecast that Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey can continue to pay dividends at current levels even in the event of a sharp downturn. The broker also upgraded Barratt Developments and Bellway to “neutral”.  ● UBS downgraded accountancy software maker Sage to “sell” from “neutral”, with a 520p target price. It cited competitive pressures and the need to invest in research and development beyond the £40m one-off cost Sage announced with 2018 full-year results. The broker also questioned Sage’s decision to classify around a fifth of its sales as legacy business as it sought to move customers to cloud-based services. “While the entry-level market generates a small proportion of sales, it makes up the majority of customers. As Sage Accounting slows . . . Sage is potentially storing up trouble in terms of future new customer acquisition as the entry-level historically has been the source of many mid-market migrations”UBS ● Jefferies downgraded UDG Healthcare, the services group for the drugs industry, to “hold” from “buy”.  Second-half problems at Ashfield, UDG’s contract sales outsourcing division, and the poor performance of acquisitions have overshadowed a recovery at its Sharp packaging business, said Jefferies. “Two-thirds of the business now seems to be facing pressures with the only immediate relief likely from potential M&A,” the broker added. Jefferies estimated that UDG has $400m-$500m to spend on acquisitions. But a cost-cutting programme will probably hold back organic profit growth this year, and a decision by management to release deferred considerations for three recent purchases suggest the market should put a higher discount on acquisition spending than in the past, said the broker. “With a potential rate-rise environment we believe investors are less bullish on roll ups,” added Jefferies.  ● In brief: Aker BP upgraded to “buy” at Stifel; Antofagasta cut to “add” at Peel Hunt; Cairn Energy upgraded to “outperform” at BMO; Carclo cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; Coloplast upgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Eco Atlantic rated “buy” at Berenberg; Ferrovial upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Georgia Healthcare cut to “hold” at Jefferies; Hermes International raised to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Hunting upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Ion Beam cut to “hold” at Jefferies; LafargeHolcim upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Orion downgraded to “underperform” at Jefferies; Raiffeisen downgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Pirelli raised to “buy” at UBS; Saipem upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Salvatore Ferragamo cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Soco downgraded to “underperform” at BMO; Straumann upgraded to “buy” at Jefferies; Suez cut to “sell” at Société Générale; Suedzucker upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Telia downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; Valeo cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Veolia cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Virbac upgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; William Demant upgraded to “hold” at Jefferies Read more

"Investors must keep up pressure on runaway banker pay","Executive remuneration is rising even as bank share prices tumble","Banker pay — across executive ranks and among investment bankers — has not fallen in line with declining profitability and share prices over the past decade  As Brexit gloom descends on Britain and across the EU, even the most hardened Brexiters have stopped talking about sunny uplands. With supermarkets warning that food will run out within days of a “no-deal” and drug supplies uncertain, optimism is scarce, too. So it is nice to see a banker benefiting from Brexit. Deutsche Bank (share price fall over the past 12 months: 36 per cent) has doubled to €6m the salary of investment bank boss Garth Ritchie. The grounds? He now has “additional responsibility in connection with the implications of Brexit”. Most people do: few have seen their pay double. Understandably Mr Ritchie’s €3m “functional allowance”, as part of an €8.6m total package, has not gone down well with shareholders. As an equities banker overseeing a predominantly fixed-income operation, he was already under pressure over Deutsche’s poor performance. Several big shareholders had called for his removal in recent months and sniped again on Friday when news of his pay emerged. Chief executive Christian Sewing’s pay also doubled, to €7m, as a bonus waiver the previous year was reversed. Both men’s awards were tone-deaf. This is a bank whose share price decline and strategic astigmatism have forced it to consider a merger with weak domestic rival Commerzbank, itself 15 per cent owned by the German government. The only way to eke success out of such a combination will be to cut tens of thousands of jobs. Doubling your own pay in the same breath makes that politically incendiary. Germany’s biggest bank is not the only European lender to institute what might be termed a mirror-image pay policy — where pay rises in inverse proportion to a declining share price. Last week Credit Suisse, whose stock tumbled 38 per cent last year, reported that chief executive Tidjane Thiam had received total pay of SFr12.7m for 2018, up 30 per cent, as a return to profit triggered an end to bonus waivers. In the UK, banks are also running into trouble with shareholders. After several years of trying to reduce overall levels of remuneration, particularly through limiting the generosity of runaway long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), investors are now focused on senior executives’ pensions. Whereas an average worker in a generous retirement scheme might secure a pension contribution of 10 or 15 per cent of salary, bank CEOs have routinely been given 30 or 40 per cent or more. Investors scored a victory 10 days ago when HSBC announced it would reduce pension contributions for executive directors from 30 per cent of salary to 10 per cent. Although tweaks have been made at some other banks, contributions at Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds remain above 30 per cent. Shareholders are rightly agitating for reductions. Banker pay — across executive ranks and among investment bankers — has not fallen in line with declining profitability and share prices over the past decade. Only if investor pressure is maintained can a sustainable level of pay for a lower-profitability sector be achieved. Clearly pay restraint can go too far. You only have to look at the plight of Allied Irish Banks, which lost its chief executive and finance director last autumn, unsettling investors. The main reason was the government-imposed salary cap of €500,000, with a ban on bonuses, for bailed-out banks. AIB remains 71 per cent owned by the Irish government. The very same investors who hate egregiously generous pay for mediocre performance also hate pay caps that make it hard to retain good executives.  There is a warning signal here. When banks are bailed out and fall foul of public opinion, more drastic action gets taken — to everyone’s detriment. If the Deutsche-Commerzbank merger ever happens, the German government’s stake in Commerzbank will become a shareholding of about 5 per cent in the enlarged “national champion”. After Commerzbank was bailed out in 2008, top executives were subjected to an AIB-style pay cap. Deutsche bankers beware: if German public opinion hardens further from its already hostile view of banks and bankers, Mr Sewing, Mr Ritchie et al could well find themselves the butt of calls for a “Deutschmerz” pay cap. patrick.jenkins@ft.com

One exclusive to start: GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, is stepping up exposure to private equity. The shift away from developed market public stocks follows concerns ranging from the China-US trade dispute to the limited monetary policy scope of central banks. Read the interview by the FT’s Stefania Palma here.
 H2O Asset Management. It’s not a name that too many DD readers would have recognised. That is, until the FT kick-started one of the year’s biggest stories in European financial services two weeks ago. DD’s Rob Smith and the FT’s Cynthia O’Murchu laid out in detail how several of the London-based asset manager’s funds had built up more than a €1bn exposure to illiquid bonds, connected to a controversial businessman with a history of legal troubles (more about this below).  H2O is no minnow. From managing €3bn six years ago, its assets under management increased ten-fold to more than €30bn earlier this year. And it’s not hard to see why. Citywire says that its chief executive Bruno Crastes (pictured) is the finest unconstrained bond fund manager of his generation: they believe the 54-year-old Frenchman has returned more than 1,100 per cent over the past 20 years.  H2O’s success has made it an important profit engine for its parent company Natixis, the French bank whose business model is based on taking stakes in boutique asset managers and advisers. The Mayfair-based fund manager contributed more than 11 per cent of the bank’s profits last year. Now H2O is battling to preserve its reputation. Investors have yanked their money out of the six funds the FT highlighted as having illiquid exposure, causing their assets to tumble by nearly €7bn. And Natixis saw nearly €2bn shaved off its market cap over two days, after Morningstar, whose assessments are used as a key guide for investors, suspended its rating on one of H2O’s funds.  Despite the heavy outflows, Crastes vowed last week that the fund would not have to resort to measures taken by other under-pressure asset managers such as Woodford Investment Management
 and GAM
, which suspended customer withdrawals. “We never gated and we will never gate,” said Crastes, in a video filmed at the firm’s Mayfair offices. “Our current motto is force and honour.” But just who is the flamboyant German entrepreneur at the centre of all this? Meet
 Lars Windhorst.  Windhorst shot to fame as a precocious teenage entrepreneur in the 1990s and was hailed as a wunderkind by then German chancellor Helmut Kohl. But by the time he was 34, he’d weathered the collapse of two companies, personal bankruptcy and a suspended jail sentence.  “He’s like a cat with nine lives,” says one former business associate, referring not just to his ability to bounce back in business but to his survival of a 2007 plane crash in Kazakhstan that claimed his ear lobe.   In Crastes’ telling, Windhorst is “extremely talented” and his network allowed the asset manager “access to very innovative companies” that had a “very high chance of success”. In their latest deep dive, Cynthia and Rob take you on a journey of how H2O doubled down on Windhorst in his hour of need, backing a series of financing vehicles that helped prop up the German financier and his investment firm.  Oh, and in the middle of all this, Windhorst bought a 37.5 per cent stake in a German first division football club last week.  Pharma dealmaking: Story in two charts Chart 1: Pharma companies are trying to move away from a reliance on a single blockbuster drug over the next five years

The lawyer-statesman: Lee Buchheit  There’s an old sovereign restructuring joke (bear with us) where the US Treasury secretary asks his Mexican counterpart about plans to resolve the country’s debt load.  The Mexican finance minister says the country has two options: a sensible, realistic strategy; or a desperately hopeful one. Heartened, the US Treasury secretary asks about the sensible solution. Unfortunately, this involves every Mexican going to church and praying for economic salvation. Discouraged, the American asks his counterpart what the desperately optimistic option could possibly entail: “That involves getting an International Monetary Fund programme and growing our way out of our crisis,” the Mexican finance minister chortles. The joke is a favourite of Lee Buchheit, a lawyer who has represented nearly every country that has gone bankrupt since the 1980s, starting with Mexico’s 1982 loan default, right up to Venezuela’s debt crisis today.  Buchheit, who is described as the “philosopher-king of sovereign debt lawyers” by The New York Times and whose favourite philosopher is Spinoza, the great Enlightenment thinker, has single-handedly built up an entire field of international law. There’s a list as long as your arm of the countries he’s helped, spanning various continents and in the process building a legal framework to guide countries in financial distress.  Buchheit even has some weighty tomes on the subject in a Dr Seuss-style poem on how to negotiate payment default clauses, which DD readers can see below.   Read the full profile of the crisis veteran on the sovereign debt frontline by the FT’s Robin Wigglesworth on Alphaville.  The annals of insider trading  An insider trading case isn’t an insider trading case without tales of skulduggery, burner phones, multiple SIM cards and, of course, meetings in an upscale members-only London club named after Charlie Chaplin’s iconic on-screen character “Tramp” — a vagrant who maintains a high-class attitude.  Before we spoil the plot of either, the FT’s Caroline Binham has all the details here and you can go inside the exclusive Tramp club in this Bloomberg article.  Job moves A power struggle at the top of Credit Suisse has resulted in the departure of its head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan, after he grew frustrated with his profile and future under chief executive Tidjane Thiam, according to several people with knowledge of the events.

"Secretive Israeli company sends a clear message to WhatsApp","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Regular readers of DD will be no strangers to NSO Group, the controversial Israeli cyber security group accused of tracking Jamal Khashoggi. Just last month we explained how a loan backing UK private equity firm Novalpina Capital’s acquisition of the Herzliya-based company backfired spectacularly for the deal’s underwriters, Jefferies and Credit Suisse. The FT’s Mehul Srivastava has now broken a monster story on the shadowy company: a vulnerability in the messaging app WhatsApp allowed NSO to inject spyware on to phones, simply by ringing up targets over the app — even if they didn’t answer the call.   
  This “zero-click” technology — as NSO calls it — has proved big business. The company’s revenues have risen from $109m in 2014 to $251m in 2018, while Ebitda has soared from $60m to $128m over the same period. You can see why Novalpina’s Stephen Peel saw a business opportunity — even if it meant he had to step down from the board of international human rights group Global Witness. The bad news for NSO: WhatsApp says it has closed the loophole. But the company is used to this game of cat and mouse. Management told investors last month that despite the regular software updates on smartphones, NSO had a “proven record” of identifying new weaknesses. The hack could be uncomfortable news for executives in finance who increasingly rely on Whatsapp’s end-to-end encryption as a secure method of communication, although some have been known to use it for nefarious means. NSO’s founders Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie have a sideline in another company with an interesting business model: producing a phone that can’t be hacked. Check out the FT’s full deep dive into the business of spying on your iPhone here. Another dead deal in Europe European dealmakers are having a tough year. Now you can add one of the biggest private equity deals in Germany in a long time to the list of dead transactions. The long-expected €5.7bn takeover of Scout24, the German classifieds group, fell apart on Tuesday after a bid from Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone failed to get 50 per cent of shareholders to back their offer.   
  Ironically, advisers close to the deal attributed its failure to significant revenue growth for the first quarter which left shareholders feeling that the business had been undervalued. The private equity consortium made it clear that there were no sweeteners on the table after agreeing on a takeover offer of €46 per share in February. Still, a stock market rally had raised investors’ hopes for a better offer. DD readers will know that European deals have struggled to get off the ground of late, hampered by regulatory constraints. Brussels blocked the rail merger between Siemens and Alstom while UK regulators crushed the hopes of Mike Coupe, J Sainsbury chief executive, for a deal with Asda. More recently, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank decided it’s not always better together. The failed takeover also highlights how difficult it is becoming for private equity firms to deploy large sums of capital in single deals as they raise their funds at record pace and size. Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone will have to keep shopping. Get the full details here. Hulu gets Kondo’d Walt Disney has Marie Kondo’d Hulu’s messy ownership structure, taking out three other co-parents for full custody of the streaming service.   
  Comcast 
has agreed to sell its 33 per cent stake in Hulu — the streaming service responsible for award-winning series The Handmaid’s Tale — to Disney as early as January 2024 at a minimum valuation of $27.5bn. The put/call deal will allow Disney to take operational control of Hulu immediately, while giving Comcast the chance to maximise its investment in a company it believes will continue to grow over the next five years. Disney, Comcast, 21st Century Fox and Timer Warner all owned a stake in the streaming service at the beginning of the year. In March, Disney became a majority shareholder in Hulu, with a 60 per cent stake, after it acquired 21st Century Fox. When AT&T sold its 9.5 per cent stake in April as part of a debt-cutting plan following its $85bn acquisition of Time Warner, it was just Comcast left. It seems an obvious deal for the Philadelphia-based telecommunications company. Comcast is getting a huge valuation premium — almost double the $15bn Hulu was valued at in April — and it has plans for its own streaming service via its media company, NBCUniversal. That being said, so does everyone else. When Hulu launched in 2007, it was conceived as a joint venture among traditional media companies getting into the streaming business for the first time, just as Netflix was moving away from its core operations of delivering DVDs to providing on-demand content on the internet.   Now, these media companies have set the wheels in motion for their own streaming services in the race to catch up with Netflix. AT&T-owned Time Warner is launching a streaming service called WarnerMedia, which will include HBO, and Disney is launching Disney+ in November with a large library of shows and films that may compete with Hulu. However, it remains to be seen whether the new wave of streaming platforms will spark joy among customers. Sign up here to Market Forces, our daily analysis of what’s moving global markets

"Deutsche Bank/bonuses: injury time","Christian Sewing’s task is to atone for the own goal of a 93 per cent cost-income ratio","In their flightier moments, investment bankers believe they should be paid like footballers. To stay in the top division, the owner must shower the team with money, they suggest.  On that measure, Deutsche Bank’s move to slash its bankers’ bonuses, reported by the Financial Times, is further evidence of the woes of Germany’s largest lender. Disgruntled, impoverished investment bankers set up Deutsche to crash down the league tables faster than Sunderland AFC. Deutsche should be judged on different criteria. Chief executive Christian Sewing’s task is to atone for the own goal of a 93 per cent cost-income ratio. Across the Swiss border, UBS and Credit Suisse have “right-sized” their investment banks to focus on expanding global wealth management markets. Deutsche does not have that option, although an eventual merger with Commerzbank could create a sustainable industrial bank serving Europe’s largest economy.  Cost cutting is part of that rethink. Deutsche does not disclose targets for the investment bank. So far there has been scant progress trimming the pay bill. In the first nine months of 2018, compensation and benefits paid were flat compared with a year earlier — despite a 3 per cent fall in staff numbers. That picture was probably distorted by an uneven distribution of payments over the full year — and lower staff numbers take time to feed through into lower costs. But Deutsche’s task is bigger: it must cut costs without revenues falling even faster. This has not been the investment bank’s forte. In the nine months to September, costs rose 1 per cent, while revenues dropped 9 per cent — and pre-tax profits by 54 per cent.  Shares in Deutsche are down almost 50 per cent over the past year, badly underperforming European rivals. If there is gloom in the bankers’ locker room, it merely echoes the mood in the corporate box occupied by investors. The market will cut Deutsche’s investment bank down to size, even if Mr Sewing does not.

"Société Générale: snow drop","European bankers hoping for a modest lift-off this year will have to wait longer","European bank share prices raced downhill in 2018 faster than grand slam skier Kamil Stoch approaching a jump. Cheerier bankers in Paris, Frankfurt or Zurich hoped for a modest lift-off this year. Société Générale shows the sector can still land as flat as Eddie the Eagle.  The French bank warned fourth-quarter capital markets revenues were roughly 20 per cent lower than the €1.35bn reported a year earlier. It suggested shareholders might prefer dividends in shares rather than cash. Oh, and it would write off €240m following disposals. SocGen’s shares fell 5 per cent, extending the loss over the past year to 37 per cent. How big a setback? SocGen is not alone in blaming trading conditions. Financial markets hit the wrong kind of snow. Volatility paralysed investors. Most unreasonably, they did not call their banks to trade the dips.  SocGen gushed about the “solid” performance of its international retail banking and financial services businesses. The capital markets revenue slide was larger than reported by US banks, according to Berenberg. That hints at even greater woes in European markets. It bodes ill for rivals such as Deutsche Bank. Switzerland’s Credit Suisse has already warned of a tricky fourth quarter. In France, Natixis is taking a €160m charge after the hedging of equity derivative risks went awry. SocGen also warned of a “significant increase” in market risk-weighted assets. The scrip dividend further heightened concerns about its capital strength. An expected core tier one equity ratio, a commonly watched measure of financial capital strength, in the 11.4 to 11.6 per cent range means the 2020 target of 12 per cent remains plausible. But this assumes half of dividends would be paid in shares. European banks were last year’s great unloved stocks. Sentiment was hit by worries about bad loans, stalling economies, regulatory burdens and flaws in the construction of the euro. Tough trading came on top of all that.  January has seen a rebound. The FTSE European bank index is up 6 per cent, compared with 3 per cent for European stocks. SocGen trades at just 0.4 of tangible book value — below BNP Paribas at 0.6 and only slightly higher than Deutsche on 0.3. Analysts, who rationalise bad news with the élan of Mr Stoch leaping 240m, will see a turnround in sight. SocGen suggests they would be wrong.  ","17.01.2019"
"Shadow over Belfast as Bombardier puts up for sale sign","Decision to dispose of Northern Ireland business comes at sensitive time for UK","In the annals of aviation, Short Brothers can claim a place among industry pioneers. The UK engineering company built early aircraft designed by Wilbur and Orville Wright and gained fame for flying boats that served in the second world war, before moving its main base from Kent to Northern Ireland. Today, the Belfast-based business faces a new and uncertain chapter in its history after it was put up for sale by its Canadian owner, the train and plane manufacturer Bombardier. The decision has put jobs on the line at one of the province’s largest private sector employers, with a workforce of 3,600 and up to twice as many among suppliers and neighbourhood businesses sustained by custom from staff and their families. It has also cast a shadow over the future of a key UK industrial asset that is a pillar of the aerospace sector. As hundreds of workers came off shift on Friday from the vast Bombardier plant at Airport Road in Belfast, one of five sites in the province, the mood was sombre.  “I think we knew there was something coming,” said Harry Watt, a 30-year veteran of the business. “Most of us are optimistic that things are going to get better and that somebody is going to look after it and come in. There’s a good bunch of lads in there. The skills are there — and it would be a shame if the company does go.” There’s no sword of Damocles hanging over [Belfast]Nick Cunningham, Agency Partners The stakes are also high for Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Conservative party relies on Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party — which has strongholds in areas where Bombardier has plants — for a majority in the UK parliament.  At a time when Brexit has caused paralysis in other policy areas, Mrs May will be keen to avoid damage to a key party initiative: an “industrial strategy” aimed at promoting skilled jobs and high-value manufacturing.  Bombardier’s decision was part of a move to rationalise its aerostructures manufacturing to sites in Canada, the US and Mexico. It is focusing on business jets and rail under a turnround plan and has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse to advise on the Northern Ireland sales process For workers in Belfast, which produces wings, fuselages and other aircraft components for a range of customers, the announcement follows years of turmoil, including swingeing job cuts, Brexit uncertainty and threats by US President Donald Trump to slap punitive tariffs on planes containing its parts. Bombardier’s headcount in Northern Ireland has fallen from more than 5,000 a few years go to today’s 3,600 after cost-reduction programmes.  The company has struggled with debt and was almost pushed into bankruptcy in 2015 by the money-draining C Series jetliner programme — its attempt to break Boeing and Airbus’ stranglehold over the market for single-aisle commercial jets. A lifeline came from Airbus, when the European aircraft maker rescued the project in 2017, buying a majority stake for C$1, renaming it the A220 and preserving jobs in Belfast. Wing production for the A220 is set to run in Northern Ireland for at least two decades and it is unlikely Airbus would look to source it elsewhere, said Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners. “There’s no sword of Damocles hanging over [Belfast],” he added.  While any immediate closures or job cuts are unlikely, the question for workers is whether the next owner will invest enough to secure long-term prosperity.  I don’t think anybody looking from outside could say that we have a stable political environment in Northern Ireland or indeed across the UKStephen Kelly, chief executive Manufacturing NI The Northern Ireland operation was described as a “prized asset” that could fetch up to $1bn by analysts at JPMorgan. While the A220 programme is a very significant contract, it also builds components for Bombardier and other manufacturers.  Among those touted as potential buyers are US-based Spirit AeroSystems, which has said it will look for acquisitions to diversify its business away from Boeing and its 737 Max that is grounded following two crashes. The company told the FT it did not comment on market speculation. Another is GKN, the UK aerospace and automotive parts supplier that was the subject of a £8bn hostile takeover by Melrose Industries last year. With its own expertise in wings and fuselage, GKN could present a logical fit.  “It would be perfectly natural for [Melrose] to look at it,” said one banker in the sector. However, others doubt that it would have the appetite given it is implementing a turnround at GKN. Melrose declined to comment. Other names include US aerospace group Triumph while Aernnova, a Spanish aerostructures company backed by private equity group TowerBrook, is seen as another potential candidate. Neither replied to requests for comment.  One attraction for a potential buyer is the proprietary technology Bombardier uses in the wing manufacturing process, which was developed in Northern Ireland partly with public financial support.  Airbus uses a different process to build the wings for its A350 and A400m aircraft. “Airbus needs the plant to remain open but I can’t see why they would want to buy it,” said one industry consultant Brexit remains a concern. Airbus, which makes the wings for its commercial aircraft in the UK, has warned it could be forced to move the work elsewhere if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.  Stephen Kelly, chief executive of lobby group Manufacturing NI, said it was “critical” for the government to provide clarity on Brexit and push for restoration of the devolved power-sharing administration after a two year hiatus.  “The first thing that any potential investor will look at is: is their money safe?” he said. “I don’t think anybody looking from outside could say that we have a stable political environment in Northern Ireland or indeed across the UK.”","03.05.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Merlin, M&B, Smurfit Kappa, Tesla, HSBC, Verbund","Patience with Babcock management has run out, says Stifel","Thursday 13:30 BST What’s happening ● Merlin Entertainments jumped after Valueact, the activist investor that owns 9.3 per cent of the Legoland operator, said in an open letter the company “should evaluate a public to private transaction”. Valueact saw “significant private capital interest in partnering with the company” and argued that it could attract a bid of about 450p a share, a premium of about 30 per cent to the undisturbed price. Analysts highlighted a heavy debt burden and the casting vote of the Kirk Kristiansen family, the Lego founders who own 30 per cent of Merlin. “We imagine that the [Merlin] board has concluded that the group cannot responsibly take on more debt to support a management buyout. And surely any possible bidders already know about Merlin without needing the cost and disruption of a ‘strategic review’ sale process. We doubt the board will change its mind about taking the business private [so] it is up to a third party to emerge and make an offer which, we believe, is more likely at the current share price and level of sterling but unlikely overall. However, this does not undermine the strength of ValueAct’s valuation argument.Peel Hunt ● Smurfit Kappa led the FTSE 100 fallers on word that one of the packaging maker’s shareholder was selling about 7m shares, equivalent to about 3 per cent of the total. Goldman Sachs was said to be handling the placing.  ● Mitchells & Butlers rose to a one-month high after the pub operator’s interim results topped expectations. Like-for-like sales grew 4.1 per cent, against forecasts of less than 3 per cent, while margins increased to 12.7 per cent in spite of cost inflation. Sales growth continued into the second half, M&B said. “Estate investment continues to support top line recovery, and progress year to date feels out of kilter with weak recent share price performance,” said Stifel. “More fundamentally, the portfolio is skewed towards tough parts of the market (value food) and we do not envisage a strong enough outlook for dividends to resume, making for a difficult investment case.” Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs upgraded HSBC’s UK-listed shares to “buy” with a 925p target price. It argued that management had strategic options to release value following last year’s legally enforced separation of its UK high street banking business. Recent full-year results from HSBC showed for the first time a breakdown of business lines following the UK business’s ringfencing in July, said Goldman. The release showed strong underlying trends at the ringfenced bank, with an underlying return on tangible equity of 12 per cent, revenue growth of 7 per cent and solid positions on funding and capital, it said. The non ringfenced bank showed the opposite, with funding and capital inefficiencies resulting in just 2 per cent return on tangible equity, Goldman said. With the non ringfenced operations accounting for about a fifth of risk-weighted assets, “this entity represents a marked drag on group returns,” it said. The non ringfenced operations can no longer reap the benefits of £30bn of excess deposits now trapped within the ringfence, as well as having assets on a much lower leverage ratio, said Goldman. “Hence, we see an increased incentive for the group to address the comparatively low profitability of the non ringfenced bank and to shrink its cost base and balance sheet.” Peers to HSBC’s ringfenced bank tend to trade at slightly higher valuation multiples, so a shift in investor focus towards a sum-of-the-parts approach might help support the stock, Goldman said. “Furthermore, we believe the ringfenced bank is likely to continue to pursue an ambitious growth strategy owing to its strong capital and funding position,” said the broker. “Its large and low-cost excess deposit base makes it well positioned to capture growth even in an increasingly competitive [mortgage] market.” ● Stifel downgraded Babcock to “hold” from “buy” after results on Wednesday from the outsourcer, which came with a cut to 2020 profit guidance.  “We’ve lost patience,” Stifel said. Management “has an uphill challenge to change investors’ perception of value given a track record of over promising and underdelivering,” so will struggle to gain confidence at capital markets day on June 5”. The broker also worried that underperformance was symptomatic of “deeper issues” needing “strategic, operational and reporting reviews that take time and involve material [writedowns] before the long-term value proposition reasserts as the investment case.”  “Fundamentally, we think Babcock is a good business with some strong foundations driven by its unique position as a well-established supplier of complex engineering solutions to the Armed Forces, emergency services and nuclear industry in the UK and increasingly overseas too. Market positions are strong, barriers to entry are high. But investor sentiment has been bruised by recurring disappointments with management not yet showing that they had command of their brief, to be seen in hitting or bettering guidance. The share’s valuation is undemanding, and becoming increasingly so, trading on a 2020 price ratio of 6 times earnings . . . But at this juncture we see few positive catalysts to drive a re-rating of the share.”Stifel ● Citigroup cut its target on Tesla to $191 from $238 and repeated “sell” advice. The broker also cut earnings forecasts for the next three years. It cited the leaked memo last week from Tesla chief executive Elon Musk that asked employees to take extreme cost-cutting measures. “The recent capital raise was a positive step but won’t necessarily get the balance sheet out of the woods if Tesla cannot achieve free cash flow targets. So the recent reported internal memo, which seemingly called into question prior guidance, didn’t help the risk/reward calculus. The implications can be serious, since an automaker’s balance sheet is always subject to the confidence ‘spiral’ risk. Good or bad, we think it’s important for the company to provide a more formal guidance update sooner than later.”Citi ● In brief: Eutelsat raised to “buy” at HSBC; IG Group raised to “buy” at Liberum; Inwit raised to “buy” at Citigroup; OMV rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Opus raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Proximus cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; S&U downgraded to add at Peel Hunt; SAS cut to “hold” at HSBC; SafeCharge cut to “neutral” at Macquarie; Serica rated new “buy” at Jefferies; Stadler Rail rated new “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Swedish Match reinstated “overweight” at Barclays; Verbund cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Dormakaba cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"Investment banking: The battle for Barclays","The UK lender has wrangled for decades over whether to maintain its investment bank. Now an activist investor is trying to force the issue","© FT montage; Bloomberg. Edward Bramson and the chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley 
 Jes Staley does not act like a man under siege. He comes across as confident and relaxed, but his breezy demeanour belies the fact that Barclays, the bank he has run as chief executive since December 2015, is the target of the most audacious assault by an activist investor on a UK company in recent history.   At stake is the future of Britain’s last remaining global investment bank, which Mr Staley has pledged to protect in the face of an onslaught by Edward Bramson, arguably one of the most successful forces in British activist investing. Mr Bramson is campaigning for the investment bank to be scaled back, claiming Barclays would do better to focus on its UK retail operation and its credit card business.  The bank first revealed that Sherborne, Mr Bramson’s investment vehicle, had built a stake in March 2018, during what was already shaping up to be a tumultuous year for Mr Staley. He was censured by regulators in the UK and US for trying to unmask a whistleblower who accused him of covering up the personal problems of a former colleague he subsequently hired at Barclays.  After narrowly surviving that scandal — which cost the bank $15m in fines — Mr Staley is confident he will prevail in the fight with Mr Bramson. “Having a major player in the global capital markets that is British is an advantage, I think, for Barclays, for our investors, and for the UK overall,” he said in a recent interview on the top floor of Barclays’ Canary Wharf tower
.  Following several months of polite stalemate, Mr Bramson in December stepped up his campaign to use his 5.5 per cent stake in Barclays to force his way on to the board and engineer a shift in strategy. An initial attempt to secure a board seat was rebuffed by the bank’s directors in November, and Mr Bramson, the company’s fourth largest investor, now plans to take his fight directly to other Barclays shareholders already frustrated over the slide in the share price under Mr Staley. It sets the stage for a bitter, months-long proxy war that could be decided by a vote at the company’s annual meeting in May.   “This could go either way,” says Philip Augar, author of The Bank that Lived a Little, a book about Barclays. “It will only be settled by Barclays demonstrably succeeding at investment banking, or it failing so badly that shareholders demand it gets out.”  The battle has implications not just for Barclays and the City of London, but also for Europe’s financial services industry, given that it comes at a time of retrenchment among most of the continent’s global investment banks.  RBS, once a major force in capital markets, has vacated the space, while Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS are dramatically pulling back. Meanwhile, US players like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are becoming ever more dominant in European trading and deal making. “Will Europe have any global banks left?” asks Ronit Ghose, banks analyst at Citi. 
 Barclays revived its interest in global investment banking under Bob Diamond, who became chief executive in 2011 © Reuters Some investors are wary of American hegemony at a time of tensions over global trade and rising nationalism. “Corporates will want to use a European investment bank,” says Richard Buxton, a veteran fund manager and long-term Barclays shareholder now at Merian Global Investors. “There is an argument for having [one] that is not subject to the whims of the US president”.
 The internal fight over Barclays’ global investment strategy has raged for three decades with one shareholder likening it to dancing the hokey cokey — “they have been in-out, in-out”, he says.  With “Big Bang” deregulation imminent, the group merged its merchant bank with stockbroker Zoete & Bevan and market maker Wedd Durlacher in 1985 to create BZW. Little more than a decade later, it broke up the poorly-performing division and sold off large chunks to Credit Suisse, leaving Barclays without a presence in equities trading or a mergers and acquisitions practice. During the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays revived its interest in global investment banking by purchasing the US operations of Lehman Brothers out of bankruptcy, while also building a large European operation.  Bob Diamond, the architect of that expansion, became chief executive in 2011 only to be ousted less than 18 months later — a casualty of the bank’s role in the Libor scandal. 

 More recently, Mr Staley’s predecessor, Antony Jenkins, tried to shrink the investment bank, having concluded it could not make decent returns in the post-crisis regulatory environment, where trading is treated as inherently hazardous. Mr Jenkins wanted to reduce the division’s risk-weighted assets — a measure of a bank’s assets adjusted for how risky they are deemed by regulators — from £122bn at the end of 2014 to £80bn, and then halve them again to just £40bn, according to a person briefed on the plan.   But Barclays’ directors got cold feet. Mr Jenkins lost out in a boardroom showdown and was fired in July 2015, opening the way for Mr Staley to take over. Today, the corporate and investment banking division — an amalgamation of the investment bank and the unit that lends to large businesses — accounts for £176bn in risk-weighted assets versus £75bn at the retail bank.  During the Jenkins era investment bankers at Barclays became dispirited, according to several people who worked there at the time. One former employee says the only contact they had with the former chief executive was a “regular memo” demanding that they shrink the size of their trading book.   But under Mr Staley, a Boston-born trader who spent three decades at JPMorgan, the division has regained 
its verve. Some at the bank date that change to the arrival in 2017 of Tim Throsby, a former head of equities at JPMorgan, to run the division. Barclays subsequently stepped up its recruitment, bringing in 55 managing directors from rivals such as Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. It is also investing £500m in new technology, in part to improve its electronic trading platform.  In more than a dozen interviews, executives and managers at the investment bank say morale improved dramatically once Mr Staley killed the debate over the future of the unit.   Stephen Dainton, the bank’s global head of equities, says Mr Staley has replaced “inconsistency” with “equilibrium”. He says his unit now has the right level of resources but that the bank needs to stop flip-flopping on its strategy. “If you look at what separates [Premier League football champions] Manchester City from Manchester United, it is more consistent execution.”

 The challenger v the banker  EDWARD BRAMSON
 Activist investor, Sherborne
Holds a 5.5 per cent stake in Barclays and is using it to try and force his way on to the board and engineer a shift in strategy away from investment banking to concentrate on its retail and credit card business  JES STALEY
 Chief executive, Barclays
Has built up Barclays’ investment banking arm since taking over in 2015 and insists that it is crucial to the bank’s future health. Has told colleagues he would resign rather than take an axe to the division  In the third quarter, revenues at the bank’s equities and fixed income trading units grew by 35 per cent and 10 per cent year on year, respectively, outpacing most rivals. However, given the poor performance of some of its Wall Street rivals in the fourth quarter, Barclays may struggle to sustain that kind of improvement. And the corporate and investment bank is still struggling to generate good returns. Its return on equity — a key measure of profitability — stood at 6.6 per cent in the third quarter versus 20.1 per cent at the UK consumer bank division.  Mr Staley’s evangelism for investment banking has made him popular within Barclays, and some shareholders think this explains the nascent turnround. “He commands the troops,” says one top 10 shareholder.  But that it is not a universally held view among shareholders, and there are few fans of investment banking among the big institutions that one might expect to own a stake in Barclays.  The bank’s share register is instead dominated by names like Tiger Global, the New York-based hedge fund, and US value funds. “Investment banking is rarely a good business, unless it is a large universal bank like JPMorgan,” says one shareholder. “And sometimes it can be a very bad business indeed.”   It is hard to gauge how much support there is for Mr Bramson. The Financial Times recently reported that he was struggling to gain traction with some large investors, although there are pockets of support.  One top-five investor says they would support the activist if he were to nominate a number of directors at the AGM, but that they are less likely to back his attempt to secure a board seat for himself. Others think there is likely to be a transatlantic split, with London-based fund managers

siding with Mr Bramson.  Mr Bramson has been shaking up companies since 1987, when he took over a US video technology group. But his approach is very different to that of corporate raiders like Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman, who have waged their battles against target companies through high-profile public campaigns.  He prefers to quietly build a stake in a company before meeting with other shareholders to convince them to back his strategy and vote him on to the board. This approach has earned him a fan club in the UK among large institutional investors like Fidelity and Aviva.


  Barclays shares have fallen by 30 per cent since Mr Staley took over in late 2015, in line with the European banks index. Much of this decline can be attributed to the spectre of a disorderly Brexit, which has led to sharp declines in the share prices of all UK banks, as well as a general malaise for European lenders struggling to restore profitability to pre-crisis levels.  But some believe that the low-returning investment bank acts as a further drag on the group’s valuation. One person who has advised Barclays points to its price-to-book valuation, which is lower than UK rivals. “If it were a pure-play retail bank, I think it would be at a higher rating than it is today.”
 Mr Staley says the reticence among some investors stems from the damage inflicted on the UK economy by RBS and Barclays during the financial crisis. “The role investment banks played in the economic crisis . . . was much greater here than what you saw in the US,” he says. “The discomfort is understandable.” Former chief executive Antony Jenkins tried to shrink the investment bank  But that does not mean his strategy is wrong, he argues. Indeed, Mr Staley has short shrift for those who do not subscribe to his theory that the investment bank will become a major asset when the next economic downturn hits UK consumers and with it Barclays’ UK retail and credit card business. 
 He says that pulling back from investment banking and doubling down on the consumer only makes sense “for those that believe we have solved the riddle of economic cycles, that we will never again have unemployment in the UK greater than 4 per cent, and that financial markets need not be volatile because the economy is so consistent and stable”.  Nor does he think Barclays can back away from riskier parts of investment banking while trying to protect more profitable lines of business. “To operate on the scale that Barclays does with our institutional clients you need to be a full-service investment bank,” he says. “You need to offer the full suite in order to generate the full returns.” Some large investors hope the fight with Mr Bramson will finally settle the question over strategy. “The Barclays investment banking story has been a slow-motion car crash for decades,” says the top-five shareholder. “Now we’re waiting for the final impact.” Mr Bramson has yet to spell out his plan in detail. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but has told his investors he wants Barclays to make “judicious” cuts to the investment bank, which he described in a recent letter as a “black box with too much leverage” that “threaten[s] the overall stability of the group”. A reduction in the unit’s assets would provide headroom for Barclays to grow its retail businesses and boost its capital position, he believes.  Without a seat on the board, however, Mr Bramson does not have enough influence to force through a change of direction. He also lacks the kind of proprietary financial information he needs to flesh out his plan to shrink the investment bank, prompting him to approach former Barclays executives to see if they can help him fill in the blanks.  One of the biggest unknowns is the stance that Nigel Higgins, the incoming chairman, will take when he joins the company in May. One person who has spoken to Mr Higgins, a veteran of Rothschild, the investment bank, says he does not favour making knee-jerk cuts to Barclays’ trading operations but equally he will not stand idly by if the share price continues to underperform.  It is hard to see how Mr Staley and Mr Bramson can both survive this battle. If the chief executive wards off the attack, Mr Bramson would have to exit his investment, potentially with a loss worth hundreds of millions of pounds. But Mr Staley has told colleagues he would leave if he were forced to take a hatchet to the investment bank.  If Mr Bramson is successful, that would mean the bank having to find yet another chief executive, its fourth in as many years. ","20.01.2019"
"UBS: online affluencer","Swiss bank is strong in a much pilloried European banks sector","Sergio Ermotti presented 2018 results and debuted on Twitter the same day. The UBS boss clearly cannot get enough abuse and sarcasm. Investor reaction, to the Swiss bank’s profits at least, may have gone far enough. Global financial market turmoil ripped through its fourth-quarter results, reported on Tuesday, resulting in outflows of client money. Profits fell far short of expectations. UBS’s shares slid 4 per cent, setting a gloomy tone to the start of European bank reporting. UBS stock has fallen a third over the past year — more than the sector. Worst-hit was UBS’s investment bank, former redoubt of Andrea Orcel, the chief executive Santander decided it could not afford. In equities, skewed towards Asia, its 10 per cent drop in operating income compared with a one-tenth rise at US banks, says Berenberg. Wealth management — the core of the Swiss bank — bore deep scars, too. Some $3.6bn of US outflows came just months after UBS put rich Americans at the centre of a strategy revamp. UBS faces a harder slog achieving the profit and net new money targets set out only last October. On Tuesday it outlined how it could spread costs by slowing growth initiatives if market conditions remained hostile.  Litigation is another headache — a ruling in a French tax evasion case is due. Prosectors have demanded billions of euros in fines.  But UBS is strong in a much pilloried European banks sector. The Swiss bank trades at just above tangible book value — against 0.8 at Zurich neighbour Credit Suisse and just 0.4 and 0.3 at wounded French and German rivals Société Générale and Deutsche Bank.  Mr Ermotti adopted Twitter late; he has been faster at centring UBS’s strategy on wealth management after global and eurozone financial crises. Risky acquisitions seem unlikely. One scenario has UBS taking out Deutsche to create a European champion. Mr Ermotti’s ambitions lie beyond the old continent.  UBS’s quarterly results depend more than it would like on financial market swings and geopolitical events such as US and China trade talks or Brexit. Client activity stalled amid the turmoil late last year — giving executives more time for social media, no doubt. UBS is a bet on rising global wealth and the opening up of China. Those long-term trends remain intact and will support the shares, even if Mr Ermotti’s experiment with Twitter is shortlived.

"UBS boosts French tax evasion provisions to $516m","Swiss bank’s litigation top-up trims $400m from 2018 annual profit","UBS has boosted its litigation provisions by $382m following last month’s record €4.5bn French penalty for helping rich clients evade paying tax last month. The lender, which is appealing against the decision to fine it €3.7bn and pay €800m in damages, has now set aside a total $516m for the scandal, in which it was deemed to have laundered proceeds of tax evasion and broken laws on soliciting French customers.  The fine, the largest for any tax case in French history, would wipe out a year’s profit if upheld. Analysts also warned it could scupper UBS’s plans to buy back $1bn in shares. “In light of the first judgment and considering the full range of potential final decisions, the provision on our balance sheet reflects our best estimate of possible financial implications,” chief executive Sergio Ermotti and chairman Axel Weber wrote in the bank’s 2018 annual report released on Friday. “That said, we still believe the verdict should be reversed, at which time we would release the provision.” The litigation top-up depressed UBS’s 2018 net profit to about $4.5bn from the $4.9bn initially reported in January — still an increase of 16 per cent — and cut the bank’s common equity tier one ratio, the key measure of capital strength, to 12.9 per cent, slightly below its target. Mr Ermotti also cautioned that there had been scant improvement in investor sentiment this year after a brutal end to 2018, when clients withdrew $13bn amid global market turmoil and the investment bank made a loss. “Our starting point for the year is different than we had planned, making this year’s journey toward our targets steeper,” Mr Ermotti wrote. “Clients so far have remained cautious in the first quarter.” Anke Reingen, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, noted that “the 2019 buyback of up to $1bn was not reiterated”, adding: “Comments on the start into the year are more cautious but remain relatively vague, and our estimates are already below the 2019 target.” Overall misconduct provisions rose to $2.8bn from the $2.5bn initially reported at the end of last year.  The six-week tax trial, the culmination of a seven-year investigation, drew out colourful details about UBS’s private bankers’ “James Bond” tactics to evade detection, including encrypted hard drives, shadow accounting systems and code words. Investigators enlisted whistleblowers wearing wiretaps to stalk the bankers and their wealthy targets through French high society. Attempts to settle foundered when French investigators proved unwilling to let the bank away with a fine of less than €1.1bn, the same amount UBS had put up as a bond during the investigation. UBS said that “amounts floated for a settlement were far above the bail and that any agreement at such levels would set an irresponsible precedent considering the lack of evidence”. Separately, UBS revealed it had decreased the 2018 bonus pool for its bankers by 1 per cent to $3.1bn, following a 6.1 per cent rise the previous year. The pool was shared by 51,819 bankers, up from 45,671 in 2017. Mr Ermotti’s pay fell by the same margin to SFr13.8m ($13.7m). That comprised SFr11.3m in bonuses and long-term incentive plans — SFr2m of which was paid upfront — and a SFr2.5m base salary. The 58-year-old Swiss executive has been awarded roughly the same amount for the past four years. “While UBS continues to be one of the few European banks with a share price trading around or above tangible book value per share, we are as disappointed as our shareholders” about its decline, Mr Weber wrote, referring to a 29 per cent plunge in the stock in 2018. 
 UBS’s local rival Credit Suisse kept its bonus pool flat at about $3.2bn after a tough year of restructuring, the Financial Times reported a month ago. However, top executives received double-digit pay rises worth tens of millions of francs after removing a voluntary cap on their pay imposed in the past two years. *The article has amended to clarify the circumstances of UBS’s decision not to settle the case.

"Why Aon abandoned efforts to buy rival in under 24 hours","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Insurance brokers are supposed to help you to prepare for the unexpected. But Aon, the industry’s number two player, caught the market off-guard on Wednesday when it said it had abandoned plans to buy Willis Towers Watson in an all-share transaction.How long did it take for Aon to change its mind? Less than 24 hours from when it confirmed its interest. To be fair Aon never even got close to combining with Willis Towers, the third-largest broker. On Tuesday afternoon it was forced admit it was considering a tie-up with its rival Willis, a deal that would have created the largest player in the industry. By Wednesday morning another statement landed: the potential all-share bid was being withdrawn. What prompted Aon’s quick about face? Here are some reasons: the prospect of a lengthy, market-by-market examination of where the two compete by the antitrust regulators;

the share price reaction after the leak, which saw Aon’s shares drop sharply. It recovered most (but not all) of the lost ground on news that the idea was dead;

the challenges associated with smashing together the cultures at two big, people-dependent businesses. DD understands that is was highly unlikely Willis boss John Haley (pictured below) would have been keen. He may have forcefully got that message across to Aon last night.

   
  It was just last year that the UK’s competition regulator investigated whether insurance brokers were engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The Competition and Markets Authority looked at whether some of Britain’s largest investment consultants — including Willis Towers Watson and Aon — should be forced to split off their consultancy and fiduciary management businesses. It eventually determined that it wasn’t necessary to force a split but it said trustees should try to secure better prices. The incident does leave Aon with questions to answer though, not least why it was looking at such a big and risky deal. In an interview with the FT less than a year ago, chief executive Greg Case (pictured below) said he was keen to build up the company’s data and analytics capabilities. He mentioned nothing about bulking up in traditional insurance broking, which is what a Willis Towers Watson deal would have done.   
  Marsh & McLennan — the world’s number one insurance broker — bulked up last year with the £4.3bn acquisition of UK based Jardine Lloyd Thompson. Marsh boss Dan Glaser can now watch from the sidelines as his rivals work out how to respond. Credit default swaps get a spring clean GSO. Those three letters mean a lot in the world of credit, and yesterday we took DD readers behind the scenes of the latest palace intrigue at Blackstone’s $130bn debt investing unit. The private equity giant has slapped golden handcuffs on Bennett Goodman
 — the G in GSO — in a bid to prevent the co-founder of their powerhouse credit business from following his two original partners out of the door.  While Mr Goodman’s firm likes to present itself as diversified and wide ranging credit investor, GSO has unfortunately become best-known for one highly controversial practice using credit default swaps: the manufactured default. The FT last year took a deep dive into this sharp-elbowed trade pioneered by GSO, which caused an uproar even in the aggressive world of distressed debt trading. But now trading powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs and Apollo Global Management have worked with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in a bid to close the loophole that Blackstone’s credit unit so ruthlessly exploited. CDS geeks can read the full text of these proposals here. But for the rest of us, there’s one key point worth noting: in the recent internal shake-ups at GSO, the senior executives who helped pioneer this aggressive CDS ploy have left the firm. GSO’s once-fearsome distressed debt unit has seen a string of senior departures over the past year, as Blackstone has looked to move away from these highly contentious and public spats. It seems Mr Goodman may have a much quieter time over the next few years as his $200m share award vests. Italy’s attempt to save Alitalia may not fly Trains, planes and err . . . well in Italy that combination is enough to cause concern. In one of the odder industrial combinations being contemplated in Europe, travellers in Italy may soon find out what happens when you put together the country's flag carrier with its state-backed railway operator. Policymakers in Rome have been wrestling with a way to rescue Alitalia, the perennially lossmaking flagship Italian airline. The leading option: merge it with Italian railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane alongside co-investors easyJet and Delta. It is a plan that is raising eyebrows and that could ultimately end in tears. While Alitalia would get badly needed funds, it would not fix the structural issues plaguing it: namely overcapacity across Europe, which has driven down fares. Add in a probe by the European Commission into a loan Alitalia received from the government, as well as large unionised and pension holding workforce, and there's a good question on how Delta and easyJet would help the airline reduce its cost base.  For any DD readers who are not following the situation (or if you're not planning a summer flight to Bologna or Verona), there’s something else at stake that should get your attention. Any deal between Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and Alitalia would signal a growing willingness by Italy’s populist coalition to intervene in the economy.

"Metals tycoon Anil Agarwal faces investor angst over Anglo deal","Deal between Vedanta and its controlling shareholder sparked a 20% fall in its share price","Indian metals tycoon Anil Agarwal is facing questions about the financial state of his empire after a controversial transaction sparked a 20 per cent drop in the share price of Vedanta Limited, in which he owns a controlling stake. Earlier this month Vedanta revealed it had paid $200m to a buy a stake in Anglo American, one of the world’s biggest miners. Vedanta bought the stake from Volcan, which is both its parent company and Mr Agarwal’s private family trust. Vedanta said the deal was part of its cash management activities, met all corporate governance standards and had been independently valued. But people with knowledge of the transaction said some of the proceeds were used by Volcan to pay off loans, suggesting an additional motive for the deal. Last year, Volcan borrowed $1.1bn to finance the buyout of another Vedanta company and also took on its debts, significantly increasing its leverage at time when the outlook for commodity markets is unclear. Volcan declined to comment on what it called specific funding decisions but said it had met all of its repayment schedules. Often using debt, Mr Agarwal has amassed a fortune by acquiring bombed-out mining assets from the Indian government and transforming their operations. The billionaire’s ultimate dream is to build an Indian version of the biggest diversified miner BHP. His interests span iron ore, bauxite, aluminium, copper, zinc, power and oil. He also has a 20 per cent stake in Anglo American, which he amassed in 2017 through a complex investment designed by bankers at JPMorgan.  Mr Agarwal has always maintained the stake in Anglo American is merely an investment in a “great company with excellent assets” and that he has no plans to launch a takeover. But the convoluted structure of the transaction, which was funded by selling mandatory exchangeable bonds to hedge funds, suggested a broader strategic intent, according to analysts and bankers. It was part of this investment that Volcan sold to Vedanta in December and which has caused its shares to slump to a two-and-half year low on corporate governance concerns.  After the deal was revealed in a results statement earlier this month, it was attacked by analysts. Rating agency Moody’s said it was a means to fund the risk appetite of Vedanta’s majority shareholder and a “clear indication” of the company’s willingness to deploy cash to “support Volcan”.  Alarmed by the reaction, Mr Agarwal and Vedanta’s chief executive Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan pulled out of a big mining event in South Africa as they tried explain the investment to angry shareholders.  Mr Venkatakrishnan has told analysts that investment in Anglo American offered a better return for Vedanta’s surplus cash than any low returning foreign currency fixed deposits.  To finance the buyout of minority shareholders in London-listed Vedanta Resources in September, Volcan borrowed $1.1bn from Standard Chartered and Credit Suisse at rates of up to 4.46 per cent over Libor. According to regulatory filings, the loan facility was split into three tranches with a $200m payment due from Volcan in January and the rest over the next three years.  “Volcan will employ a wide range of strategies to repay debt as it comes due, including dividends from subsidiaries and refinancing,” the trust said.","18.02.2019"
"First high-yield corporate bond deal in weeks comes to market","US gas pipeline company Targa Resources is set to sell $1.5bn in debt","The weeks-long freeze in US junk bond issuance is beginning to thaw, with gas pipeline company Targa Resources set to sell $1.5bn of debt on Thursday in the first high-yield bond deal since November last year. Targa, which carries ratings at the upper end of high-yield issuers, initially came to market with a $750m bond with an 8½-year maturity, but strong investor demand saw the company double the size of the transaction, adding a $750m 10-year tranche, according to people familiar with the deal.  There had been no new sales of high-yield bonds for 41 days, marking the longest drought on record, according to data company Dealogic, which has records back to 1995. Issuance froze amid fears over slowing global growth and further tightening by the Federal Reserve. But corporate debt markets have enjoyed a resurgence in the new year, with strong jobs numbers bolstering confidence in the health of the US economy, and Fed policymakers easing concerns over the pace of interest rate increases with more dovish commentary.  There is some interest coming back into high yieldHenry Peabody, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance A modest recovery in oil prices has also helped. Energy companies account for roughly 15 per cent of the high-yield bond market.  The credit premium on high-yield bonds — that is, the extra yield being demanded compared with risk-free US Treasury bonds — has fallen 78 basis points this year to an average of 459bp, according to an index run by ICE Data Services.  North American high-yield bond funds also recorded $2bn in investor inflows this week, after eight straight weeks of outflows.  “We have been starved of new issues and we have had reasonable inflows into the market from ETFs and actively managed funds,” said Ken Monaghan, co-head of high yield at Amundi Pioneer. “Not only have we had a dearth of supply but we have had an increase in demand.” The 8½ -year tranche of Targa’s issuance was set to be sold with a coupon of 6.5 per cent with the 10-year at 6.875 per cent. The proceeds are expected to be used in part to buy back existing Targa debt. Equity analysts at JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and Jefferies have all upgraded their recommendations for the company’s stock in the past month after it fell 36 per cent in the final quarter of 2018 as oil prices slumped. The company operates pipelines for natural gas and natural gas liquids. It is developing new projects in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico to help deal with the problem of excess gas produced alongside oil.  Higher-rated “investment-grade” bond issuance has also slowed in recent weeks but not to the same extent, with some companies still issuing debt.  Anheuser-Busch InBev Worldwide brought a combined $15.5bn debt sale on Thursday across six maturities, set to be the largest debt sale of the year so far.  Analysts said the high-yield market is poised for further issuance. Some investors have been drawn back into the market as prices have stabilised but others said there was still reason to be cautious.  “There is some interest coming back into high yield,” said Henry Peabody, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance. “For us, we have got to pick our spots and look at individual names. We are not in a position where there has been capitulation and you could be far more aggressive.”","10.01.2019"
"Renault seeks ‘irreversible’ Nissan alliance despite ‘mistrust’","New chief says carmaker will work to overcome any ‘disturbances’ caused by Ghosn’s downfall","Renault has said it will work to overcome any “mistrust” between itself and Nissan caused by the downfall of former chief executive Carlos Ghosn and ensure the alliance between the two carmakers is “irreversible”. Speaking as Renault downgraded profit targets for the coming year because of weak annual sales, new chief executive Thierry Bolloré said that the arrest of Mr Ghosn in Japan in November on suspicion of misconduct had caused major “disturbances”. He added that Renault would make sure this did not affect operations and that mistrust did not cause problems for the alliance between the two companies. “Our goal within the alliance has not changed, which means we want to make it irreversible”, he said, echoing comments made a year ago by Mr Ghosn. However, the Renault boss said that it was “too early” to give specifics about any structural changes to the alliance. He said talks with Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa had so far been purely operational, adding that it was in “that spirit” that “possible talks [about the structure] could resume again”. Before his arrest, Mr Ghosn had been pushing for a merger between the two. This was resisted by Nissan because of fears it would give Renault too much control, the Financial Times reported last year. Mr Bolloré would neither “confirm nor deny” reports about planned changes to the structure of the alliance. At the moment, the two companies own shares in each other but Renault has more control. He did say that the companies needed to move faster to make savings, to allow investment in electric vehicles and other technology, and to offset higher costs. Analysts at Credit Suisse were unsurprised that Renault’s aim is to “make processes within the alliance faster and more agile”. “Renault should have an even more vital interest in continuing the co-operation [than Nissan],” said the analysts. They argue that Renault has more to gain from the synergies generated by the alliance. Renault’s annual revenues fell 2.3 per cent to €57.4bn in 2018, partly because of currency fluctuations but also because of a decline in diesel sales across Europe that Mr Bolloré said was a permanent change in the region. Operating income was just under €3bn, compared with €3.8bn last year, while net income — which includes shared profits from Nissan — fell to €3.4bn from €5.3bn, largely because of a fall in contributions from its Japanese partner. As a result, Renault said it was targeting an “operating margin of about 6 per cent” in 2019, a drop from the 2018 target of more than 6 per cent. It also said it expected “both the global and European market . . . to be stable compared to 2018”, except if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, incurring tariffs and border checks. Shares in Renault rose 3 per cent after the results as they were better than expected. Analyst Max Warburton at Bernstein said the outlook was “surprisingly confident”, but added “at this moment, the detail of the numbers doesn’t really matter. Instead, everyone is focused on the relationship with Nissan.” Mr Bolloré, who is also the new chief executive of the alliance, said that he had met Mr Saikawa several times since November to discuss the business, while Renault’s new chairman Jean-Dominique Senard also spent “many hours” in discussions with the Nissan leader. Mr Bolloré and Mr Senard were appointed last month to replace Mr Ghosn. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn","14.02.2019"
"S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite close at new records","Dovish Fed helps drive US equities past previous closing highs as earnings season begins","US stocks reached a record high on Tuesday as investors, reassured by recent dovish signals from central banks, extended a months-long recovery in spite of continued uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy. The benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.9 per cent higher at 2,933.7 thanks to the best daily gain for healthcare stocks since mid-January and a rally in consumer discretionary and technology shares. That pushed the equities benchmark past its peak closing level from September 20 last year of 2,930.8. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.3 per cent to close at 8,120.8, taking it past its previous peak close of 8,109.7 on August 29. The S&P 500 is up 17 per cent so far this year and marks a recovery of about 25 per cent from a recent nadir on December 24, when it closed on the verge of a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite is up 22 per cent in 2019. “This is about improving global economic growth,” said Erik Ristuben, global chief investment strategist for Russell Investments. “The next leg of the market moving up is beyond a rebound — it’s now a new outlook on economic growth.” The new highs come after some indicators in the US bond market had pointed to a potential recession in the world’s largest economy and as investors gird themselves for a challenging first-quarter reporting season in which S&P 500 earnings may show a year-on-year decline for the first time since 2016. But early signals have suggested that may be too pessimistic and earnings could show modestly positive earnings growth. “The ‘earnings recession’ that was going to happen now may not come to pass,” said Michael Mullaney, director of research for Boston Partners. As attention remained on the US earnings season, with numbers due from Facebook and Boeing on Wednesday, stocks in Europe and Asia failed to gain traction from the Wall Street record.   The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 fell 0.2 per cent. Asia’s technology sector looked exposed after Texas Instruments warned in an earnings update after New York markets closed that slowing chip demand might continue for a few more quarters. Seoul’s Kospi, home to a range of technology stocks, fell 0.9 per cent.  Futures trade expected the S&P 500 to slip from its high by 0.1 per cent.  The wider rise in US stocks could mark the beginning of a “melt-up” scenario forecast last week by Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. He said improving economic data and more dovish central banks would entice big investors who have so far stayed largely on the sidelines of the 2019 market recovery back into equity markets. The 
Fed has had the market’s back. The central bank pledged in January to be “patient” before tightening monetary policy further, and then forecast in March there would be no further rate rises in 2019. In April, it said the next rate move could be in “either direction”. Derivatives markets are signalling a 56 per cent chance of the Fed cutting rates by the end of this year.  That has emboldened investors to snap up high-growth stocks, particularly in the technology sector, which were among the hardest hit last autumn when signs of a slowing global economy began to emerge and the Fed was still keen to tighten monetary policy. Information technology is at the top of the S&P 500 sector leaderboard, up 27 per cent since the new year. Within that sector, chipmakers have been top performers, while the high-profile tech giants collectively known as the Faangs — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet — took relatively longer to accelerate compared with previous market rebounds. The Philadelphia semiconductor index that tracks 30 companies in the industry is at record highs, while the NYSE Fang Plus TM index, which tracks the Faangs and other large tech stocks, is still about 8 per cent shy of its peak in June 2018. “We’re getting an increasingly positive outlook for equity markets,” said Ghadir Cooper, global head of equities for Barings. “The numbers coming out are better than expected in consumer discretionary, tech and industrials, so it seems like first-quarter earnings will be OK,” she said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a narrower gauge of the US equity market, is still 0.6 per cent from a record because of trouble for Boeing, which has the biggest weighting in the average and has been hit by concerns over the safety of its 737 Max aircraft. Equities are the only major global asset class that analysts at Credit Suisse think will outperform over the next three to six months, and within that they favour US and emerging market stocks over those from the eurozone. “Our positive US equity view also reflects our continued preference for the IT sector,” they wrote in a recent report, adding that they were also positive on materials stocks, which would benefit from an increase in manufacturing demand in China. Some analysts remain concerned about the recent inversion of the yield curve — when short-term borrowing rates rise above long-term ones — which has been a powerful indicator of impending recession in the past. “We still see a very high risk of a recession in 2020,” said Mr Ristuben of Russell Investments. “That is the fear overshadowing the decision among professional investors to participate in this melt-up scenario.” Additional reporting by Alice Woodhouse and Siddarth Shrikanth in Hong Kong

"Pound traders braced for volatility after May’s deal defeated","Sterling settles in early trading but political uncertainty over Brexit dominates","Sterling steadied in morning trading on Wednesday but traders were braced for more volatility after parliament’s resounding rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal deepened the uncertainty over the UK’s relationship with the EU.  The currency was little changed against the dollar and the euro in London, erasing an initial tumble following Mrs May’s defeat late on Tuesday, as Brexit continues to drive sentiment towards the pound. Rejection of her Brexit deal in the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 gives Mrs May until Monday to announce the next steps in her efforts to secure parliamentary approval for an agreement before the March 29 deadline. The increasing uncertainty over the future of Brexit has left many investors and traders wary of making bets on the pound. “Our central scenario remains that a soft Brexit deal is more likely than the UK exiting without a deal,” said Suresh Tantia, investment strategist at Credit Suisse. “With markets in mind, the continued absence of clarity is likely to lead to further volatility in the near term.” Sterling was at $1.2861, having tumbled as low as $1.2825 in the minutes after the result of the vote was declared on Tuesday. It was also becalmed against Europe’s single currency, with 88.58p needed to buy one euro.  UK stocks, which have joined the global bounce in equities so far this year, edged lower. The FTSE 100 was 0.6 per cent weaker, while the FTSE 250, home to companies more reliant on the UK economy, was largely flat falling just 0.02 per cent. Meanwhile, UK government bonds were weaker as the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt climbed 7 basis points to 1.32 per cent. Rating agency Moody’s warned that the failure of Mrs May’s deal “extends the period of uncertainty over the UK’s relationship with the EU, a credit negative for many rated issuers”. Analysts said that one driver of sterling’s resilience since the vote was the expectation that Mrs May’s government would survive a motion of no confidence tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. One strategist at a large US bank said the assurance with which Mrs May invited Mr Corbyn to table the vote, which she is expected to win today, may have helped the pound erase its losses. “Her confidence seems to suggest that she is expecting to survive the . . . motion, which removes one downside risk for sterling, the risk of a Corbyn-led Labour government,” said the analyst. Sterling has acted as a lightning rod for investors’ views on Brexit since the referendum in 2016.  “Markets are firmly focused on the risks of a no-deal and/or a potential general election,” said Dean Turner, UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Though the former isn’t out of the question, the danger of such an outcome seems to have diminished in recent weeks, given parliament has expressed its desire to avoid it. The lack of immediate downside in sterling supports this view.”  He added that investors should avoid taking directional views on sterling, gilts or UK equities while this “clarity void” remains so large. Although sterling could rebound if a deal is struck, some investors warn that the currency’s potential to strengthen would be limited.
 How markets reacted to Theresa May's historic Brexit defeat “In the event of some form of the government’s deal ultimately garnering sufficient support to pass through the House of Commons, I believe sterling would once again strengthen, although I do not see it regaining pre-referendum levels versus the US dollar or the euro,” said Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Merian Global Investors.  “A strengthening in the region of 5-8 per cent would seem more likely than the approximately 15 per cent rally by the pound that would be required to regain those pre-referendum highs.” A deal would also boost the case for the Bank of England to lift interest rates in 2019, which would provide further support to the currency.","16.01.2019"
"US earnings scorecard: S&P 500 eyes first earnings decline since 2016","Five things to watch as first-quarter earnings season unfolds","While the debate on scrapping quarterly reporting continues, JPMorgan — whose chief executive Jamie Dimon emphatically argues against quarterly guidance — unofficially kicks off earnings season on Friday.  Here’s what to watch for. Top and bottom line
 The S&P 500 is expected to report a blended rate of actual and estimated earnings decline of 4.2 per cent in the first quarter from a year ago, according to data provider FactSet.  If that plays out, it would mark the first year-on-year earnings contraction for the S&P 500 since the second quarter of 2016 and the biggest such decline since the first quarter of the same year, when EPS fell 6.9 per cent.  Meanwhile, revenues for S&P 500 companies are estimated to rise 4.7 per cent — the weakest increase since the third quarter of 2016, according to FactSet.  “The lift from tax cuts and higher government spending that boosted economic and profit growth in early 2018 is now fading,” note analysts at UBS. “In addition, activity in the first quarter was likely further dented by the lengthy government shutdown and poor weather — flooding and extreme cold.”  UBS argues, though, that if corporate America should top Wall Street’s view in line with the historical average, earnings should grow between 0 to 2 per cent in the first quarter.  And the winners among them? Utilities are forecast to post the biggest earnings per share growth, up 4.7 per cent, while communication services are projected to report the biggest revenue growth, up 13.4 per cent.  Banks
 Financials are expected to report a 3.8 per cent fall in earnings but a 4.8 per cent increase in revenues — the third-biggest rise of all sectors in the S&P 500, FactSet notes. “The large banks have indicated that muted capital market activity in the first quarter due to sluggish trading volumes will be a drag on overall results (although this will be somewhat offset by aggressive share repurchases),” UBS said.  Energy
 Unlike recent quarters, the energy sector is expected to post the biggest decline in earnings and revenues. Earnings are projected to tumble 20.1 per cent, while revenues are expected to slip 3.3 per cent amid a drop in crude prices. While West Texas Intermediate has recovered from its December low, the average price of US crude in the first quarter was $54.90 — about 13 per cent lower than a year ago, when the average stood at $62.89. Exploration and production companies, which are some of the top constituents of the S&P 500 energy sector, are especially sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. Moreover, this follows a blockbuster quarter for the sector in Q1 2018, when earnings surged 95.8 per cent and revenues grew 14.5 per cent.  Profit margins
 Currency translation, wage inflation and rising transportation and raw material costs could crimp margins as businesses struggle to pass on these costs to consumers. Indeed, US profit margins are forecast to have their first fall in four years in 2019.    Official wage data has hinted at this, with average hourly earnings up 3.4 per cent year-on-year in February at a cyclical high, although they have eased since then. Companies also sound less confident of customers’ willingness to absorb higher raw material costs driven by the ongoing trade war between the US and China and higher freight costs. Meanwhile, among Fang stocks — Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google — measures to address privacy and security concerns are contributing to margin pressure, according to Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse.  “We think the greatest issue continues to be profitability, so we will be examining margins most closely for signs of either stabilisation or worsening,” said Michael Wilson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “We continue to believe the fiscal policy was poorly timed and Fed dovishness doesn’t resolve it. Labour, inventory and excessive capital spending are the greatest areas of excess causing corporate margin pressure.” Market reaction
 Despite expectations for a significant drop in corporate profitability, the S&P 500 jumped 13.1 per cent in the first three months of the year — its biggest quarterly gain in almost a decade.  That could partly be attributed to an improvement in the risk profile of the market, which believes the Federal Reserve “is out of the picture”, according to Mr Golub. Indeed federal fund futures indicate policymakers are likely to cut rates twice between now and the end of 2020.  Moreover, the Vix, Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” has fallen back to about 13-14, below its longer-term average of about 20 and down from its recent high of 36 in December. It remains unclear, though, how the market will react if earnings turn up weaker than forecast or if guidance proves disappointing. Consensus is for earnings to remain flat and revenue to grow 4.6 per cent in the second quarter, according to FactSet.  Indeed, some analysts argue that despite US companies typically topping estimates by 4 to 6 per cent, they don’t expect earnings to turn positive in the first quarter. “We believe this quarter will mark the start of another earnings recession,” said Mr Wilson.  If consensus shifts toward this more pessimistic view, it could unnerve investors. ","11.04.2019"
"Smooth sailing","Mike Mackenzie’s daily analysis of what’s moving global markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email. Mike Mackenzie is currently away. So we bring you some highlights of today’s Financial Times coverage of global financial markets:
 Volatility and fear, or lowering levels of both, are the chatter in the markets on Tuesday. fastFT has been looking at the state of tranquility.   If you thought the equity market looked calm at the moment, it can’t hold a candle to foreign exchange, where levels of volatility are hovering around their lowest levels since 2014, writes Peter Wells. Diminished expectations for US interest rate rises this year have helped drive measures of equity market volatility lower in recent months, subsequently propping up stocks, and also pushed down currency market volatility. That trend has been further reinforced thanks to the European Central Bank, which is set to keep interest rates lower for longer in a bid to rev up economic growth in the bloc, thus tamping down on the euro. The JPMorgan global FX volatility index this week fell to its lowest level since September 2014, and is down by about one-quarter so far this year. A similar index tracked by Deutsche Bank is also at its lowest level since the same month. Excluding a skittish British pound, the average one-month implied volatility of G7 currencies is now sitting around a level of 6, “and less than 1 volatility point away from the all-time low set in the summer of 2014”, notes Mandy Xu at Credit Suisse.  As markets are wont to do, levels of volatility as low as these do not tend to hold for long. But a key difference this time is that these declining levels of FX volatility have come despite investors spending most of last year bracing for higher interest rates: the about face from the world’s two biggest central banks has really only happened since the start of 2019. Read more. Panic over? It is according to the derivative markets. Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge fell to its lowest level in five and a half months on Tuesday, as diminishing expectations for further US interest rate rises this year continue to boost investors’ appetite for equities, writes Pan Kwan Yuk. The Cboe’s Vix index, which gauges investor expectations of short-term volatility in US stocks, dropped as much as 5.6 per cent to trade at 12.37. That’s the lowest level since October 5 and marks a dramatic climbdown from the 36.2 reached at the height of the market sell-off in late December.  The move comes amid a continued rally on Wall Street. The S&P 500 has fully recovered from the December downturn to trade at a five-month high and is up 13 per cent so far this year. Read more. Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar? Gold rush over? — The almost 3 per cent slide in the gold price over the past month has prompted speculation that the yellow metal’s rally is over, writes Neil Hume. A stronger US dollar, optimism about US-China trade talks and rising equity markets have combined to knock the haven asset from an 11-month high. Its decline from just over $1,340 a troy ounce has been mirrored by a drop in the amount of physical gold in exchange traded funds, which has dipped to 71.8m tonnes, from 73.3m at the end of January. The money investors have ploughed into ETFs helped drive the 14 per cent rise in the gold price from its most recent low in August of $1,173 an ounce, as markets grew increasingly anxious about the health of the global economy and were unsettled by huge swings in equity markets. Read more.  Eurozone wage resilience — Wage increases in the eurozone kept up their swift quarterly march despite weaker industrial output, official data showed. In the final quarter of last year, nominal hourly pay increased at an annual clip of 2.3 per cent, matching the revised figure for the third quarter, Eurostat data revealed. Not since 2009 has a higher rate been recorded. Pay increases were resilient in the 19-member region despite slowing in Germany to 2.4 per cent, though still the strongest among the biggest economies, from 2.7 per cent in the three months to September. Italy also revealed slower growth in wages. Figures in Portugal, France and the Netherlands meanwhile improved. Valentina Romei reports more here.  Your feedback I'd love to hear from you.

"Investors call for Lyft to scrap dual-class share structure plans","Pension funds, unions and asset managers urge changes ahead of IPO roadshow ","A group of pension funds, unions and asset managers in the US, the UK and Europe is urging Lyft’s board to scrap a proposed dual-class share structure, as the ride-hailing company prepares to pitch its $20bn initial public offering to investors this week. Lyft is looking to raise around $2bn and will be seeking a valuation of at least $20bn, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is set to begin its IPO roadshow on Monday. Reuters first reported the proposed valuation and fundraising target. Lyft and its bankers, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse, declined to comment.  The company revealed plans to create a new class of shares carrying 20 votes each in regulatory filings this month. That will give its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, voting power that will exceed the roughly 7 per cent of the company they collectively own ahead of the IPO. The investment groups said Lyft should stick with its single class of shares with one vote each when it debuts on the Nasdaq exchange later this month, according to a letter they sent to directors last week. Failing that, they said, the company should adopt a “sunset” provision to phase out the extra voting rights within seven years. “Lyft is imposing unnecessary and uncompensated investment risk on potential shareholders both by switching to a dual-class structure and by failing to commit to one-share, one-vote by a certain date,” the letter said. The sense was some progress had been made in addressing our concerns, and now Lyft’s IPO is threatening to reverse thatRichard Clayton, CtW Investment Group The letter was signed by investors with $3.2tn in assets, including the UK’s Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, BNP Paribas Asset Management, pension funds representing public employees in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Ohio, the Teamsters union and United Auto Workers retirees. “With a dual-class structure, Lyft is basically shielding itself and company insiders against shareholders who deserve a voice. Outsized control among an unaccountable few is an unnecessary risk — and Lyft should go back to the drawing board,” said Scott Stringer, New York City comptroller, who oversees the city’s pension funds. Lyft declined to comment on the letter. Under the structure outlined in its IPO prospectus, its founders’ voting power will be less than 50 per cent, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  The supervoting class B shares held by Mr Green and Mr Zimmer would convert to regular shares if their collective class B holdings fall below 20 per cent of their stakes at the time of the IPO. The company has taken other steps to shore up governance including installing an independent board chair. In its upcoming roadshow, Lyft, which has rushed to reach public markets before its larger rival Uber, will emphasise its rapid revenue growth and market share gains. Sales doubled to $2bn last year and the number of people who have taken a ride in the last quarter has risen almost sixfold since 2016. The company’s capital structure plans would make it the latest technology company to go public with classes of supervoting rights that concentrate control with their founders, following in the footsteps of Alphabet, Facebook and Snap, rather than the one share, one vote structure of the majority of publicly traded companies. Advocates say giving founders more control helps insulate them from activist attacks and focus on long-term goals. But many pension funds and other big institutional investors have pushed back against dual classes, which they say limit their rights as owners. Large index providers including S&P Dow Jones Indices have tightened their rules to exclude companies with multiple share classes. “The sense was some progress had been made in addressing our concerns, and now Lyft’s IPO is threatening to reverse that,” said Richard Clayton, research director at CtW Investment Group, which represents union pension funds and organised the letter. CtW pointed to several companies that went public in the past year with dual class structures and adopted time-based sunset clauses, including Bloom Energy, EVO Payments and Smartsheet. Snap’s structure was considered particularly egregious, as it sold shares with zero voting rights in its IPO, giving co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy 97 per cent of votes. At Facebook, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg controls 60 per cent of votes despite owning just 14 per cent of the company. The Council of Institutional Investors, which represents asset managers including BlackRock and T Rowe Price, has also lobbied Lyft’s board to adopt a sunset clause.","17.03.2019"
"How London banks are trying to dodge Brexit","Regulators want more activity shifted to mainland Europe but lenders have other ideas","© FT montage / Getty Since the UK voted to leave the EU more than two years ago, banks have been in a cat-and-mouse game with supervisors, trying to minimise expenses and keep the vast majority of their operations in London. European regulators are demanding that they bulk up on the continent. But with the type of Brexit still unclear weeks after the UK was supposed to have left, international banks are doing everything they can to keep their options open. 
 The European Central Bank has nipped in the bud banks’ most egregious attempts, but many legal loopholes still exist. Some will be tolerated initially to ensure financial stability, but over time will be cracked down on, according to bank executives and supervisors interviewed by the Financial Times. “The whole thing is politicised,” said the European chief executive of an international bank. “There is a fight on for City jobs with the EU, and the ECB is part of Europe’s armoury.” Back-to-back trading The most common workaround to soften the impact of Brexit is back-to-back booking. For decades London has used the technique to establish itself as a global hub, which sees trades and loans made abroad transferred to London via parallel, offsetting transactions. This allows risk, capital and liquidity to be managed in one place, cutting costs for banks and their clients alike. To what extent this can continue long-term is unclear because European regulators have sent mixed messages. The ECB has privately warned international lenders they have three years’ grace on back-to-back, but added it expects them to significantly reduce their reliance on it during that period. At the same time Andrea Enria, then head of the European Banking Authority and now the ECB’s bank supervision chief, said there would be no “ban” on the practice after Brexit, calling it the “backbone” of global investment banking. What is Brexit?  “By far the biggest enabler to not build up Brexit costs is the back-to-back model and that is absolutely what we will be doing on day one,” said Jonathan Lewis, head of Nomura in Europe. “But in time I know the ECB will push to have more and more trading operations on the ground in the EU, for both financial stability and political reasons.” The head of government affairs at another international bank concurred, saying regulators have made it clear ultimately they want all EU-related risk management to be performed inside the bloc, which means significant extra expense. “Eventually costs could become too high and we could even end up not operating out of London any more,” the person said. “Why would we operate two risk management centres in the same timezone?” Reverse solicitation Another quirk that could result from a no-deal Brexit is the need for London-based investment bankers to have EU-based “chaperones” on calls and in meetings to avoid breaching rules on soliciting clients from outside the bloc. While regulated far less closely than their cousins in trading, M&A and capital markets staff will have to ensure an EU-approved banker is present for every client engagement, a potentially cumbersome arrangement. One way around this is to get a “letter of engagement” from a client specifically asking for services from a non-EU firm, known as “reverse solicitation”.  Credit Suisse is preparing a system that can automatically log participants on calls to quickly prove staff from its EU hubs are involved in deals, according to people familiar with the development. The Swiss bank already has dozens of advisory bankers in Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid, with another 75 in London ready to move if the UK crashes out with no deal, they said. Clients coming to London Another way to solve the solicitation problem is to have the clients come to you. European companies are setting up small operations in London through which they can do the majority of their financial deals, according to Barney Reynolds, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling. “You establish a small entity with a few people on the ground to visit bankers in London, then report back to head office,” Mr Reynolds said. “When the deal is done the new entity would sign the contract. I am told by bankers there’s been quite a lot of that and it is by far the cheapest way.” Empty shells These are the nightmare scenario for EU banking supervisors, and one that they have been determined to thwart. Also known as a letterbox or brass plate, it is the fear that banks would try to establish a bare-bones EU27 presence while keeping their meaningful activities in London. The threat of the empty shell is what has driven the EBA and ECB to set limits on back-to-back trading and to restrict remote booking: the practice of a local employee booking a transaction directly with a parent company outside of the EU. But the issue is broader than that. The ECB is wary, for example, of banks finding shortcuts around moving staff to the continent by relying on secondments or “dual hatting” of key staff. It warned in a paper last year that such practices “are expected to be used only in exceptional circumstances and in duly justified cases”. Sabine Lautenschläger, the deputy head of the ECB’s bank supervision board, warned in January that lenders could “circumvent our expectations on empty shells” by setting up branches rather than full subsidiaries “or by providing cross-border services from third countries”.

"Stocks to watch: Ocado, Genmab, Nvidia, Caterpillar, Vodafone","Dixons Carphone’s valuation too low for market-leading business, says Morgan Stanley","Monday 15:00 GMT What’s happening ● Ocado led the FTSE 100 gainers on news that the grocery delivery specialist was in early stage talks with Marks and Spencer about a potential technology tie-up. News of the negotiations came ahead of Ocado’s partnership with Waitrose expiring next year. The options for Ocado would be to sign up M&S as an additional customer; replace Waitrose with M&S as its key supplier; or sell control of the UK business in its entirety and become a pure-play technology company, said analysts. Bernstein Research saw more sense in the first option than the second, with the broker arguing that “Waitrose brings material buying volumes on branded products that M&S could not bring”. On the option of selling the UK retail arm, Merrill Lynch valued Ocado’s pure online grocery business at 310p a share with the technology platform worth 710p a share. But with M&S already carrying debt on its balance sheet equivalent to 2.75 times annual operating earnings, “it is tough to see [how it can] afford even 50 per cent of Ocado Retail, which we value at £2.3bn”, said Macquarie. “It clearly releases significant value/cash from Ocado’s point of view to let it focus and accelerate the technology path. But Ocado needs to showcase the retail division’s progress to existing and potential new customers for some time still. So a deal like this may be unlikely until some of these contracts are implemented and Ocado has other case studies to demonstrate the successful rollout of its Solutions platform.” ● Genmab of Denmark gained after the US District Court of Delaware declared the three patents asserted by German peer MorphoSys as invalid because the claims made were too broad and cancelled a jury trial. MorphoSys had filed the suit in 2016 against Genmab and collaboration partner Johnson & Johnson claiming their Darzalex cancer drug had infringed the patents.  MorphoSys, which has an option to appeal, was the Stoxx 600’s sharpest faller. “Considering this fundamental weakness in the patents, the fact that the judge’s summary judgment did not require additional expert testimonies on the issue and a still-unresolved allegation of inequitable conduct . . . the likelihood of a positive appeal is low in our view and the decision likely marks the end of the story . . . We see the ruling as the best-case outcome for Genmab as it removes the lingering uncertainty regarding the magnitude of potential financial damages, thereby lifting overhang from the shares.”Kempen & Co ● Caterpillar slipped after posting fourth-quarter earnings per share of $2.55, lower than the $2.99 consensus forecast. The main culprit was the group’s Machinery, Energy & Transportation division, which suffered on cost inflation and lower revenues from the Chinese construction industry.  Caterpillar’s 2019 profit guidance also disappointed, with adjusted EPS of $11.75 comparing with a $12.64 midpoint of forecasts. However, the range included restructuring costs and a higher tax rate that were not in analysts’ models. ● Nvidia led chip stocks sharply lower after it cut fourth-quarter revenue guidance from $2.7bn to $2.2bn. The graphics chip specialist blamed “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China” as well as weaker than expected sales of higher-end data centre products. ● SNC-Lavalin
 dropped on a profit warning. The Montreal-based engineering group blamed a problem with a project in its mining and metallurgy unit, as well as continuing issues in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia. “Inter-governmental relations between Canada and Saudi Arabia, together with unpredictable commodity prices and uncertain client investment plans, have led to deterioration in our near-term prospects which we cannot ignore,” the company said. Adjusted EPS for 2018 would be between $1.15 and $1.30, down from $2.60 to $2.85 previously, SNC warned. It also announced a writedown of goodwill tied to its oil and gas business of $1.24bn, or $7.06 per share. Sellside stories ● Morgan Stanley upgraded Dixons Carphone to “overweight” with a 240p target. A valuation of less than seven times calendar 2020 earnings was much too low for “a market leading, sustainable retail business”, it said. The combined group was now worth about 20 per cent less than Dixons was, on a standalone basis, when it merged with Carphone Warehouse in the summer of 2014, said Morgan Stanley. That was in spite of Dixons’ core electricals business delivering five years of positive like-for-like sales and profit growth thanks to “an increasingly benign competitive landscape and a business model that has been successfully re-engineered to cope with the threat posed by internet retailing”, it added.  And while it was a surprise that Dixons had not chosen to close down the lossmaking Carphone Warehouse chain, management’s move away from handset financing should release hundreds of millions of pounds of working capital over the next five years, said the broker.  As part of its 2019 retail sector preview, Morgan Stanley also upgraded Next and Halfords to “equal weight” on valuation grounds. Its overall sector view was in line. “Investors may be bearish, but with real income growth accelerating, unemployment low and sourcing costs stable, we think the outlook for UK retail this year isn’t that bad. But we remain concerned about rising costs and think the impact of IFRS 16 [lease accounting regulations] is being underestimated.”Morgan Stanley On Brexit uncertainty, Morgan Stanley’s house view put a 5 per cent chance of the UK leaving the EU at the end of March without an agreed deal. Putting aside that uncertainty, the broker compared the current benign backdrop and weak sentiment for UK retailers with 2012, when the sector outperformed the wider market by 23 per cent. ● Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded Vodafone to “buy” from “reduce” with a 160p target price.  “Since our initiation [in July], the shares have come under strong selling pressure and have lost around one-third of their value. The sell-off has pushed Vodafone’s dividend yield to almost 10 per cent, signalling market belief in an imminent dividend cut. However, in our view the market reaction to a potential dividend cut is too extreme. Assuming a cut from €0.15 to €0.11 per share, its yield is still appealing enough in our view; and buying the shares now would leave the opportunity to lock in great yield.”Kepler ● In brief: ABB downgraded to “sell” at Berenberg; Coca-Cola HBC raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Danske Bank downgraded to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; EDP upgraded to “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Forterra cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Gym Group rated “neutral” at Citigroup; Logitech upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Micro Focus cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; National Express upgraded to “buy” at Liberum; Novozymes upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; On The Beach rated “buy” at Jefferies; Petra Diamonds downgraded to “sector perform” at RBC; Roche upgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Schindler raised to “buy” at HSBC; Software AG upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Tod’s cut to “underperform” at Jefferies; Tyman downgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; Volution cut to “hold” at Berenberg.

"Bristol-Myers withdraws US application for lung cancer treatment","Drugmaker withdraws FDA application for combination treatment","US drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb hit a stumbling block in the competitive market for immunotherapies as it withdrew an application for a combination of drugs to treat lung cancer, even as it reported upbeat quarterly earnings.  The New York-based company on Thursday announced a voluntary withdrawal of its application for US approval of its cancer treatment — a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy — for the treatment of a certain type of non-small cell lung cancer. The company said following recent discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, it believes it needs further data. “We did not think an approval for that filing would have made much of a near-term commercial impact,” said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, though he added that it “does raise new questions on the company’s overall strategy” in lung cancer.  Bristol-Myers Squibb’s blockbuster Opdivo drug, which has been approved to treat several types of cancer, saw sales of $1.8bn in fourth quarter. While that topped some analysts’ estimates, with a Reuters poll indicating expectations for sales of $1.47bn, it missed others, with a Bloomberg survey forecasting sales of $1.84bn. The drugmaker was a pioneer of checkpoint inhibitors, a type of immunotherapy that turns the body’s immune system into a weapon against tumours, but it has faced stiff competition from companies like Merck. Indeed, the latter’s Keytruda immunotherapy overtook Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo treatment for the first time last summer.   For the fourth quarter the company said revenues jumped nearly 10 per cent to $5.97bn, just shy of forecasts for $5.98bn, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.  It swung to a profit of $1.19bn in the quarter compared with a loss of $2.3bn in the year-ago quarter. That translated to earnings of 73 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.42 a share. Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of 94 cents a share that topped expectations for 85 cents.  Bristol-Myers Squibb in January agreed to acquire Celgene in a $90bn deal. The tie-up would create a world leader in oncology, with nine drugs that each generate more than $1bn in annual sales and a pipeline that has the potential to reach $15bn in revenue.  “We are beginning 2019 with good momentum in our current business, with Opdivo and Eliquis continuing as strong and growing franchises,” said chief executive Giovanni Caforio. “Our planned acquisition of Celgene will position us to create a leading Biopharma company, with best-in-class franchises, significant near-term launch opportunities and a deep and broad pipeline, creating an even stronger foundation for long-term sustainable growth.” Shares in the US drugmaker were little changed at pixel time and are down nearly 4 per cent year-to-date. That follows a 15 per cent drop in 2018. ","24.01.2019"
"India: luxury groups make a play for nation’s rising wealth","One watchmaker is using the Cricket World Cup to reach consumers, while other brands expand in the country’s main hubs","India has long been considered a compelling prospect for Swiss watchmakers and luxury jewellers. Yet while it has seen mouth-watering economic growth and a rising middle class, for many these have not expanded enough to overcome the country’s painful import tariffs, red tape and price-sensitive consumers. Some watch and jewellery brands are starting to place bets that India has reached a tipping point, however, and are positioning themselves to grow in the country of 1.4bn people.  For them, everything from the rise in whisky imports to Indian tourists’ growing spending power are signals that wealthier Indians are ready to splash out on fancy timepieces. Analysts also point to signs that the economy is finally recovering from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s controversial 2016 decision to ban the country’s high-value banknotes, which choked the cash supply many used for expensive purchases.  India’s luxury goods market is worth about $10bn in annual revenue, according to Statista, a data provider, with watches and jewellery accounting for just over half of the total. “In the past decade or so China has come from nothing to become the major growth driver for luxury goods,” says Jon Cox, head of Swiss equities at research company Kepler Cheuvreux. “I’m not saying this will happen with India, but there is clearly similar potential. I think the luxury goods industry recognises that.” Mr Modi’s recent victory in national elections boosted stocks, underpinning hopes for a business-friendly government and strong consumer demand. One watchmaker, however, is pinning its hopes on cricket rather than politics to stimulate consumer demand in the country. Hublot is a sponsor of the Cricket World Cup, which England’s batsmen will open in a match against South Africa. But the Swiss brand will be looking beyond the 25,000 spectators packed into The Oval in London as it eyes a new audience 4,000 miles away in India.  There is similar potential [between China and India]. The industry recognises thatJon Cox, head of Swiss equities at Kepler Cheuvreux “In India, cricket is the most followed sport throughout all the population ages and categories,” says Ricardo Guadalupe, Hublot’s chief executive. “We decided to get involved in a big way.” Of cricket’s 1bn fans worldwide, 90 per cent hail from the Indian subcontinent, according to the ICC cricket body. The watchmaker hopes the country’s burgeoning nouveau riche — with 343,000 US-dollar millionaires in 2018, according to Credit Suisse — will add luxury timepieces, alongside cricket, to the list of things they value highly. After more than a decade selling its watches through Indian retailers, Hublot is opening its first boutique alongside the likes of Gucci and Burberry in Mumbai’s luxury Palladium Mall in August, and plans to add two or three more in India in the coming years.  It is not alone. Christoph Grainger-Herr, chief executive of IWC Schaffhausen, says it will start selling watches this year at an outlet in Hyderabad, its fourth in India. Similarly Chopard plans to open a boutique in Mumbai in “the near future”, says Karl-Friedrich Scheufele, its co-president.  Hublot hopes that by aligning its fortunes with cricket, its appeal will accelerate among the sliver of India’s huge population capable of forking out several thousand dollars on a watch. To mark the collaboration, the watch brand is launching 50 limited-edition timepieces made with gold, titanium and sapphires for the Indian market.  Mr Guadalupe recalls how the sight of Swiss watches and French luxury bags adorning wedding guests on a recent trip to India cemented the idea that it was time to invest in the country. “The market for luxury watches will really boom the day the upper middle class really starts to buy foreign luxury,” he says. “It is slowly starting.” India accounted for less than 1 per cent of all Swiss watch exports in 2018 by value, less than Portugal and a tenth that of mainland China. But exports to the country jumped 34 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, making it one of the fastest-growing markets. Foreign luxury brands have typically been reluctant to do more than dip their toe into India, selling limited quantities through local retail partners, banking that big spenders will visit their stores while on trips to Dubai or Singapore.  One needs to understand the Indian jewellery buyer’s psychology. They don’t care much about the brandAbhay Gupta Until 1997, India enforced a decades-long ban on watch imports, designed to protect the domestic watch industry. It has since maintained high tariffs and taxes that amount to as much as 30 per cent on imports. Industry participants had hoped that a trade deal between India and the European Free Trade Association, which includes Switzerland, would help boost business. But the sides have struggled to overcome differences on intellectual property and other points, despite years of negotiations.  Some brands are forging ahead regardless. Mr Scheufele says Chopard has been subsidising the cost of its products to reduce the blow of high import tariffs for consumers. Its jewellery watches have done particularly well, he adds. The company’s Mumbai plans follow a near doubling of its Indian sales since 2014. While Chopard had been selling in India for about two decades, its fortunes improved when it took direct control over local distribution. “The market is as competitive as you can get,” he says. “In the long run, we believe that it is worth the investment.” Some foreign jewellers have found India to be less promising, according to industry analysts. Unlike watches, consumers see jewellery as a store of wealth and are unlikely to pay a premium for a brand name, says Abhay Gupta, who advises luxury brands in India, making it tougher for the Cartiers and Bulgaris of the world to crack the market.  “One needs to understand the Indian jewellery buyer’s psychology,” Mr Gupta says. “They don’t care much about the brand. One will look at the design and ask the local jeweller to make it . . . Culturally, we look at the amount of gold or diamond used, and the weight.” India is also reeling after celebrity jeweller Nirav Modi last year fled the country accused of being at the centre of a $2bn bank fraud — allegations he denies. Incomers acknowledge the challenges. Sascha Moeri, chief executive of Swiss watch brand Carl F Bucherer — which sells in India through local partners — describes Indians as “demanding clients”. Indian customers’ likes and dislikes, he says, “spread like a fire”. Fast-growing domestic luxury brands such as Zoya and Amrapali Jewels have had more luck. The key for vendors, suggests Amrapali’s chief executive Tarang Arora, is to double as commodity traders. “In India, you’re not just buying jewellery, you’re investing in a precious metal,” he notes. Indians, he says, “are being continually taught by their parents that . . . you invest in a piece of land and you invest in gold”. For foreign watchmakers, assimilating local culture has proved essential — not least in the form of tie-ups with Indian celebrities. Chopard organises events with Bollywood royalty such as actor Saif Ali Khan.  For Hublot, linking the brand to India’s favourite sport and the wildly popular Indian batsman Rohit Sharma has been a reliable crowd pleaser, Mr Guadalupe says. “We had complete streets blocked by thousands of people in front of stores where we were having a small event with Rohit,” he says.  Such enthusiastic displays, he believes, “makes India very different from all other markets”. ","30.05.2019"
"Stocks to watch: IMI, William Hill, Stars Group, Leonardo, Etsy, BPM","Morgan Stanley predicts Shell’s first dividend hike in five years","Thursday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● IMI slipped after the engineer said organic sales growth weakened 2 per cent year on year in the first quarter due to a sharp decline at its critical engineering division, which sells valves and seals to the power and oil industries. Management said critical product order intake was strong and, in spite of mixed trading conditions across the group, full-year results should meet market expectations. Precision engineering was the bigger concern for analysts, with IMI tempering divisional guidance on sales growth and margins. “A weaker precision outlook in an already pretty flat trading outlook for 2019 highlights the issues” faced by new chief executive Roy Twite, said RBC. ● Barratt Developments climbed after the housebuilder said in a 10-month update that full-year results should be modestly ahead of previous expectations. “The key driver of the beat is margin growth, driven by self-help initiatives, with house price inflation broadly offsetting cost inflation. We think that these trends will continue over the next few years, which should lead to good earnings growth in the context of the sector and support returns at a time when others are seeing some moderation.”Numis Securities ● Leonardo of Italy, formerly known as Finmeccanica, led the Stoxx 600 gainers on better than expected first-quarter results. The defence engineer posted 16.4 per cent   order growth thanks to a pick-up in demand for helicopters and electronics, as well as a spike in orders for detection systems. Management saw sales growth levelling off in the rest of the year but remained “comfortable” with guidance. “The first is seasonally the weakest quarter, so it is difficult to extract a trend. However, the emphasis on the analyst call was very much ‘a good start’,” said Citigroup.  ● Etsy was under pressure in US premarket trading after cautioning that marketing investment would hold back current-quarter margins. The crafts website reported a solid start to the year, with first-quarter gross merchandise sales above expectations in spite of weakness in January-February, but hopes of a significant upgrade to full-year guidance proved misplaced. “Investors are looking for a path to continued acceleration of gross merchandise sales growth and may not be seeing it here with year-on-year comparisons getting increasingly difficult, a challenging scenario for shares trading at a premium,” said Wedbush. It kept a “neutral” recommendation and $60 target on Etsy, equivalent to 62 times 2019 expected earnings per share.  ● The Stars Group surged after the PokerStars owner announced a sports wagering partnership with Fox Sports, the first of its kind between a national US broadcaster and a bookmaker.  The companies said they planned to roll out a Fox Bet portal in states that allowed sports betting, in a similar format to its 2018 UK acquisition Skybet, as well as offering a free-to-play game nationwide involving cash prizes. Fox agreed to invest $236m in TSG for a 5 per cent stake, as well as taking an option to buy up to 50 per cent of the company’s US business in 10 years. “TSG is effectively looking to replicate the success of the SkyBet deal in a far bigger market,” said Barclays.  “TSG has secured a well-known brand to leverage across the whole of the US. Fox gains access to a new, fast growing revenue stream and creates greater diversification. Taking a long-term view, we think the winners in the US sports betting industry will be the companies with national, well known brands that are able to leverage a customer base with a keen interest in sports. So akin to Paddy Power Betfair’s deal with FanDuel, TSG’s deal with Fox makes sense . . . However, the short history of the US sports betting market suggests that after an initial share price spike as the market gets excited about a deal, earnings downgrades are typically met with share price underperformance in the short term.”Barclays Sellside stories ● Goldman Sachs repeated “neutral” advice on William Hill and Paddy Power Betfair in research that cut forecasts across the bookmaking sector by about 15 per cent. The broker also set a 190p target on William Hill, down from 270p previously. “The industry has entered a new reality where multiples will be fundamentally lower, amid persisting regulatory uncertainty and maturing levels of growth,” said Goldman. It argued that bookmaker valuation multiples between 2015 and 2018 were higher than historic levels thanks to online growth, material sector consolidation and a stable regulatory environment in mature markets. However, paced on precedent the current growth outlook was likely to attract a valuation of no more than 10 times earnings, it said. “We are seeing a rising regulatory burden on the industry, which we believe is here to stay and, combined with greater market maturity, will lead to a normalisation of the growth outlook for the sector,” Goldman said. “Moreover, with growing focus on ESG [environmental, social and governance] integration, we think online gaming companies’ multiple could remain depressed, even if growth opportunities arise, unless they are able to more clearly demonstrate to investors that they are actively engaging with key ESG issues facing the sector.” ● Morgan Stanley upgraded Royal Dutch Shell to “equal-weight” from “underweight” ahead of the oil group’s investor day scheduled for June 4. It said to expect an increase to Shell’s already “outsized” dividend. Shell should struggle to sustain a $15bn-plus annual dividend cost while investing only $25bn of capital, which was low versus peers, said Morgan Stanley. It expected management to raise the 2020 capital expenditure budget to about $30bn. However, oil companies tend to be punished if they increase capital expenditure without also raising the dividend and most of Shell’s peers had increased their payouts since 2014, the broker said. Shell’s five years without dividend growth had made it an “outlier within its industry”. “We still see better prospects for dividend growth and dividend cover-by-free cash flow at other majors, including BP and Total. However, we believe Shell is unlikely to underperform in coming months if expectations for a dividend hike start building.”Morgan Stanley ● In brief: Adecco raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Aggreko rated new “sell” at Investec; Aker BP upgraded to “hold” at Société Générale; Aurubis raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Balder cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Banca Generali cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Banco BPM cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Bechtle rated new “buy” at HSBC; Cancom rated new “buy” at HSBC; DWS cut to “hold” at HSBC; Datagroup rated new “buy” at HSBC; Diversified Gas & Oil rated new “buy” at Cenkos Securities; Gama Aviation raised to “hold” at Jefferies; Norsk Hydro raised to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Ontex downgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; ProSieben upgraded to “hold” at Liberum; UBI Banca cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Unibail cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley.

"Stocks to watch: Intel, Glencore, RBS, Computacenter, Hastings","Stagecoach’s record-low valuation prices in too much bad news, says Citigroup","Friday 13:00 BST What’s happening ● Intel plunged in US pre-market trading after cutting its full-year targets. The chipmaker guided for $69bn in full-year sales and $4.35 in earnings per share, down from $71.5bn and $4.60 previously, on weakening operating margins. Management singled out insufficient demand for data centre chips that was likely to persist into the current quarter.  “We view Intel’s issues as being largely company-specific, rather than a read for the industry,” said Jefferies. A 6 per cent year-on-year fall in datacentre chips in the first quarter suggests Intel has lost market share to main rival AMD, as well as to specialist silicon from Nvidia and Xilinx, so declines were likely to continue, it said. Growing demand for datacentre chips has underpinned the Intel bull case so, if sales turn negative on an annual basis, the argument may need to shift to: “Intel is a cost cutting story,” it said. ● Glencore retreated in response to news that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission was joining a Department of Justice investigation into potential corrupt practices launched in July 2018. The DoJ has been investigating whether dealings by Glencore’s oil trading division in Nigeria, Venezuela and Democratic Republic of Congo distorted US commodity prices. Analysts saw Glencore’s reputation at greater risk than its balance sheet. “With no mining operations on the ground in Nigeria nor in Venezuela, any potential penalty there would have to be a function of (thin) oil trading margins,” said Exane BNP Paribas, which downgraded the stock to “neutral” with a 350p target price. “DRC was already investigated extensively by the US and official intermediary [Dan] Gertler was sanctioned, although royalties were subsequently allowed to be paid in euros. Nevertheless, this fresh headline does cast a cloud on Glencore’s re-rating potential from here.”Exane ● Royal Bank of Scotland was the FTSE 100’s sharpest faller after its quarterly underlying profit missed expectations. “We would argue that the results are low quality,” said Citigroup. While RBS’s £1bn of statutory first-quarter profit before tax beat the consensus by 13 per cent, the result largely reflected a sharply lower impairment charge. Revenues fell 6 per cent year on year and cost reduction was not as successful as analysts had expected, meaning underlying earnings before costs related to litigation, strategy and own-debt adjustments were 8 per cent below the median forecast at £1.3bn.  ● Computacenter rallied to its best level since October after the IT outsourcer said in a brief first-quarter update that trading was ahead of original expectations. Management said it had seen no signs of customers cutting budgets and was “firmly on track to deliver on our expectations for the year as a whole”. ● Hastings hit a 2019 low after the car insurer warned that claims inflation was continuing to run well ahead of policy pricing due to competition, compressing profit margins. For the first three months Hastings reported a 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in policy numbers and 4 per cent quarterly premium growth. If market trends persist the group loss ratio — total losses divided by the total premiums — would be expected to move towards the higher end of the 75-79 per cent target range, Hastings warned.  Each percentage-point deterioration in the combined ratio, which factors into the loss ratio general business costs, reduces Hastings’ earnings per share by circa 6 per cent, Peel Hunt said. The broker also said it continued to expect Hastings’ target of 3m policyholders this year, up from 2.75m at the end of March, to be a struggle. “Hastings is letting Insurance margins slip within the target range . . . helping the retail broker retain its competitive edge but at the expense of a margin squeeze. Hastings is feeling the inevitable effects of a plateauing cycle but is technologically ahead of the competition which gives the company a significant advantage in the current market environment. We believe the company will continue to balance volume growth against achieving its targeted margins.”Peel Hunt ● Ferrexpo plunged after its auditor Deloitte resigned with immediate effect. Results this week from Ferrexpo had revealed that Deloitte disagreed with the company’s finding that a charity receiving donations from the Ukrainian iron ore pellet maker was not under the control of Kostyantin Zhevago, its chief executive and majority shareholder. Sellside stories ● Citigroup upgraded Stagecoach to “buy” from “neutral” with a 155p price target. A record-low valuation of about 10 times earnings, excluding Stagecoach’s rail business, priced in too much negative sentiment when risks were reducing, it said. “With the impending exit from the beleaguered UK rail sector and the sale of the underperforming North American division we see a significantly de-risked portfolio with a cash-generative UK bus business with stabilising operating profits.”Citi A deep dive through the biggest franchises in Stagecoach’s regional bus division, which accounts for about 90 per cent of the stock’s value, “suggests that if passenger volumes continue to fall the company has scope to achieve operating expense efficiency gains”, said Citi. However, rather than risk exacerbating volume declines, management was likely to use cost cutting only to defend margins, it added. Citi’s upgrade followed Stagecoach on Thursday announcing a £60m share buyback. With the planned sale of the North American division cutting Stagecoach’s debt leverage to its lowest level since 2011, more detail on cash return plans was likely at full-year results in June, said the broker. ● In brief: Alfa Laval cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse and to “hold” at Jefferies; Bobst rated new “buy” at Berenberg; Bonava cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; IWG upgraded to “buy” at Stifel; Kuehne + Nagel cut to “sector perform” at RBC; SEB cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Telecom Plus cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Valeo downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; Van Elle raised to “add” at Peel Hunt; Viscofan cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

"Occidental snubs hostile takeover boutiques in Anadarko bid","Oil group turns to its well-connected BofA and Citi bankers in Houston for its $55bn bid","When Bank of America and Citigroup turned up at the side of Occidental Petroleum for its hostile bid for Anadarko Petroleum, Wall Street dealmakers were not surprised. Occidental has forged close relationships with both banks, particularly Bank of America, where it has regularly poached high-level talent.  But its decision to stick with its longtime bankers rather that tap one of the legion of boutique hostile takeover specialists is a break from some recent high-profile fights; gold miner Barrick, for example, hired Michael Klein and his namesake advisory firm M Klein & Company, for its failed bid for rival Newmont while hedge fund-backed newspaper group MNG Enterprises turned to Ken Moelis’ Moelis & Co for its hostile bid for USA Today-owner Gannett. It is also a reflection of how Occidental has approached the deal — at first hoping to strike a friendly merger before being outmanoeuvred by oil giant Chevron — and how symbiotic its relationship has become with Bank of America, where it has repeatedly relied on high-level talent as part of its strategic decision-making.  The job for bankers at BofA and Citi, a team that includes some of the most well-connected advisers in Houston, will be to snatch Anadarko from Chevron’s hands after a takeover was agreed two weeks ago. The price Occidental has offered is $55bn, including debt it would assume as part of the takeover.  The eventual price paid could be higher. Chevron is loath to engage in a bidding war, people with knowledge of the company’s thinking said. But it may nonetheless turn up at the bargaining table so it does not lose highly prized US shale oil assets as well as a natural gas project in Mozambique and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that Anadarko owns. The fight could be brutal and would rank as one of the largest hostile takeovers struck over the past decade if Occidental comes out on top. BofA’s leading role in advising Occidental can be traced back to one of the driving forces behind the transaction: Oscar Brown, a former BofA oil and gas banker, who joined Occidental in 2016 with a mission to help the company’s chief executive Vicki Hollub carry out a transformational deal.  $200bnThe value of acquisitions advised on by former Bank of America executive Oscar Brown Mr Brown has worked on more than $200bn of transactions as a dealmaker and is “quirky, bright and very aggressive”, a person close to him said. The bid for Anadarko would be the most audacious of his career, the person added.  But the BofA relationship dates back far before Mr Brown’s hiring though: former Occidental chief executive Stephen Chazen worked on oil deals when he was a managing director with Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of America during the financial crisis.  Ms Hollub and Mr Brown have been steered by Patrick Ramsey and Purna Saggurti, the co-head of global mergers and acquisitions and chairman of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America, respectively. The two men have been joined by Brad Hutchinson, who co-head’s the bank’s Americas energy investment banking department and whose team last year advised on the $10.5bn sale of BHP’s shale assets to BP.  The trio of Bank of America bankers are also flanked by a pair of Citigroup executives: Stephen Trauber and Mark Shafir. Mr Trauber, who is well known in Houston and sponsors a regional travelling basketball team, counts oil refiner Valero among his clients. Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, worked with Mr Trauber when the two were at UBS. Mr Trauber would go on to seal Anadarko’s largest takeover: its $18bn purchase of Kerr-McGee in 2006. While Mr Shafir has not specialised solely in energy deals — he is the global co-head of M&A at Citi — his work on a number of high-profile transactions will prove valuable to Occidental. Mr Shafir led Citi’s work advising chipmaker Broadcom on its attempted takeover of rival Qualcomm, a deal that was ultimately blocked by US president Donald Trump, as well as the reverse merger that saw Dell go public late last year. The Occidental board also counts a former Citi executive among its ranks. Carlos Gutierrez, who joined the Occidental board as a director in 2009, was previously vice-chairman of Citi’s institutional clients group. If Occidental is successful in its bid, Bank of America and Citi will be in line for a lucrative payday. Dealogic estimates fees on the deal could reach $170m, which will be split with the advisers to Anadarko. Another $100m-plus could be earned to finance the transaction, should Occidental tap corporate bond markets to fund the cash portion of its offer. Bridge financing would add millions more in fees.  The deal would also represent a significant win for the two banks, as US rivals such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have worked to solidify their hold on the advisory business. Citi and Bank of America have ranked either fourth or fifth in global M&A advisory assignments in each of the past four years, according to Dealogic. While still early in the year, the work for Occidental could help Citi claw back market share and edge itself into the top three for the first half of 2019. On the competing side Chevron is being advised by some of Wall Street’s best known dealmakers. That includes Credit Suisse’s Greg Weinberger, an adviser to some of the world’s largest energy groups, and Scott Barshay, a partner at Paul Weiss, who has advised General Electric, IBM and Harris Corporation on deals worth a total of nearly $100bn in recent months.  Both Chevron and Occidental have found veteran Evercore energy bankers Dan Ward and Will Hiltz, together with Goldman Sachs’ head of natural resources Suhail Sikhtian, sitting at the opposite end of the negotiating table with Anadarko. The Anadarko board must now decide if the bid from Occidental is superior to the deal it has agreed with Chevron, and then whether or not to engage with Occidental. Anadarko’s advisers have been studying their next move after Occidental submitted two offers and never heard back from its target. Tech innovations fuel an oil and gas fightback","25.04.2019"
"Deutsche Bank investment bank boss doubles pay with Brexit boost","Garth Ritchie revealed to earn €250,000 extra a month for overseeing Brexit plans","Deutsche Bank has attracted heavy criticism for more than doubling the pay for the head of its struggling investment bank last year to €8.6m, including €250,000 a month extra to oversee the lender’s Brexit plans. Garth Ritchie was the best paid Deutsche Bank executive last year, earning more than chief executive Christian Sewing, who nevertheless also doubled his pay to €7m, according to the bank’s annual report on Friday.  Investors, unions and politicians attacked the pay rises, which come at a sensitive time for Deutsche Bank as it is locked in talks about a controversial merger with German rival Commerzbank to create the eurozone’s second-biggest lender. Despite a poor share price and earnings performance, the management board opted not to waive its bonuses for a fourth consecutive year after Germany’s biggest bank eked out a small profit. Mr Ritchie’s “functional allowance” for Brexit has totalled €3.25m since it started in December 2017 and is scheduled to run until November 2020, by which time the award will amount to €9m. “It would have been smarter [for managers] to either once more waive their bonuses entirely or just accept half of them,” said Klaus Nieding, vice-president of the German Shareholders’ Protection Association. He described the bank’s 2018 profit of €341m as “primarily symbolic” and too small to signify it was out of the woods. In February, several of Deutsche Bank’s biggest shareholders called for deeper cuts to its perennially lossmaking US investment bank after running out of patience with the lender’s poor performance and tumbling share price. Some also questioned whether Mr Ritchie, whose contract was extended in 2018, was the right person to lead the business. Lothar Binding, a Social Democratic member of parliament in Germany, said “the question is if executive pay [at Deutsche] is at all linked to managerial performance”. He added that pay at the bank was “completely out of hand” compared to normal employees’ salaries. Oliver Popp, spokesman of Germany’s DBV union, said that he struggled to comprehend Mr Ritchie’s Brexit allowance. “Normally you would assume that dealing with Brexit is just part of his normal job,” Mr Popp told the FT. Deutsche Bank said its executives’ pay “reflects the improvements made by the bank to the stability of its balance sheet, the return to profitability and the significant progress made to reduce costs and improve returns”.  It added that nearly 97 per cent of its shareholders approved its pay plan last year and most of the bonuses were paid in shares that vest over seven years and can be clawed back for wrongdoing.  A person familiar with Deutsche Bank’s decision said the “functional allowance” for Mr Ritchie was a way to make his pay more competitive, given that rival investment bankers earn more than him and the EU has capped bankers’ bonuses. The annual report also revealed chief risk officer Stuart Lewis received an extra €150,000 a month to “further improve the relationship with US regulators” from November 2017 to August 2018, which increased his pay by €1.2m last year to €6.1m. Mr Lewis was judged by the bank to have hit 80 per cent of his individual targets last year, while Mr Sewing was rated to have exceeded his targets, said the person. While the group overall returned to annual profit in 2018, the investment bank’s pre-tax profit fell 52 per cent, its revenue was down 8 per cent and it made a return on equity of less than 1 per cent. The bank’s shares fell 58 per cent last year and have plunged more than 90 per cent since the start of 2008. “Deutsche Bank’s management is out of touch with reality,” said Sven Giegold, a Green member of the European parliament, adding that it was “just indecent” to accept such a pay rise at at time of poor operating performance and with thousands its employees fearing job losses in a potential merger with Commerzbank. “An honorable merchant would just not do that.” Last year Deutsche Bank’s US subsidiary was put on a federal list of institutions with weaknesses serious enough to threaten their survival, following a move by the Federal Reserve to label it “troubled” a year ago. The lender was also fined $7.2bn by the US Department of Justice in late 2016 to settle a probe of mortgage misselling. Sylvie Matherat, chief regulatory officer, who is responsible for the lender’s anti-money laundering operations that in 2018 were publicly rebuked by German financial watchdog BaFin, also more than doubled her pay to €4.5m. While the lender’s total management board pay rose to €55.8m — up from €29.8m in 2017 — the bank cut its bonus pool for rank-and-file bankers by 14 per cent to just under €1.9bn.  Separately, Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam received a 30 per cent pay rise last year — despite a 38 per cent plunge in the stock — after a cap on his pay was removed and the Swiss bank returned to profit to break a three-year lossmaking streak.

"Kraft Heinz shares dive 27% after SEC opens probe","$16bn wiped from company’s market value after ‘disastrous’ update","Shares in Kraft Heinz dived 27 per cent on Friday as Wall Street reacted with alarm to a “disastrous” update in which the company took a $15bn writedown and disclosed it was the subject of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting policies in procurement.
 About $16bn was wiped from the market value of the company behind Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Kraft dinners and Oscar Mayer hot dogs after it disclosed the bad news.  The writedown, combined with the SEC subpoena, intensified concerns about the management style of 3G Capital, which engineered the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz and went on to pursue deep cost cuts. Only two years ago the enlarged group had hoped to buy Europe’s Unilever but the planned $143bn deal collapsed amid concerns about a culture clash. The SEC probe prompted the company to launch its own investigation and, as a result, it recorded a $25m increase to its “costs of products sold”.  “They didn’t really go into a lot of detail but it doesn’t seem to move the needle — it just looks bad,” said John Baumgartner, analyst at Wells Fargo. Kraft Heinz said it was co-operating “fully” with the SEC, was improving its internal controls and did not expect the matters subject to the investigation to be “material” to its financial results. Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz © Bloomberg Kraft Heinz took the impairment charge to reflect the more downbeat prospects for the profitability of some of its best-known products.
 Shares fell to their lowest level since the group was created and triggered a rout across the wider sector with investors questioning how custodians of other big brands were coping as consumers shunned packaged foods.  By early afternoon in New York, Campbell Soup was down 8.3 per cent, General Mills 3.4 per cent and Kellogg 3.3 per cent.  Kraft Heinz’s travails reverberated in Europe, knocking as much as 4 per cent from Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, which was also built by 3G. Although the two circumstances are not exactly the same, ABI is also struggling to show that it can stoke sales growth after years of relentless focus on expenses and margins. The [SEC] didn’t really go into a lot of detail but it doesn’t seem to move the needle — it just looks badJohn Baumgartner The troubles at Kraft Heinz and ABI were “calling the whole model into question”, said James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC. “Kraft Heinz is to food what Budweiser is to beer: brands that are not very hip or current, and struggling to be relevant.” Kraft Heinz’s writedown reflected a reduced value of goodwill at its US refrigerated and Canada retail businesses and its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. “The trademarks have a value based on assumptions of future cash flows — but now they are saying their future earnings power is not what they initially expected it to be, so they need to write down the value,” said Mr Baumgartner. Bond markets also reacted with concern. Kraft Heinz bonds due to mature in 2045 dipped 1.24 cents on the dollar to 83.67 cents, just over 2 cents shy of an all-time low. The developments had “the hallmarks of a company that has a serious balance sheet problem”, said Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, who described the update as “disastrous”. Kraft Heinz slashed its dividend more than a third and said it was eyeing divestitures in an effort to shore up its balance sheet. Wall Street raised eyebrows over remarks from Bernardo Hees, chief executive, who signalled that despite the setbacks the company still had its eye on dealmaking.  The dividend cut and disposals would give Kraft Heinz “the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation — for us to be a consolidator — if the industry goes that way”, he said. Steven Strycula, at UBS, said: “We do not believe a large-scale deal is in KHC investors’ best interest. Margin gains have proven unsustainable and [earnings] erosion makes debt deleverage challenging.” Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, 3G’s highest-profile backer, was caught up in the sell-off. Shares in Berkshire, Kraft Heinz’s biggest shareholder, were down 1.7 per cent. Additional reporting by Joe Rennison and Arash Massoudi

"How to recession-proof your investment portfolio","Bond markets signal volatile times ahead, so investors should take stock now","© FT illustration After years of worrying about how Brexit could impact their portfolio, UK investors are now facing an even greater fear — that the global slowdown could morph into a global downturn. The warning signs have certainly been flashing across world markets this summer. Continued trade tensions between the US and China, weak economic data and a growing sense that policymakers have little firepower left are all factors weighing on investors’ minds.  Here, FT Money writers examine the signals world markets are showing, how investors are reacting, and what commentators expect to happen next — plus why now is the time to review your portfolio and work out the best long-term strategy to weather the likely storms ahead.  Which recessionary indicators are investors watching? In short, the bond markets. As fears of a downturn increase, investor demand for bonds has rocketed. The haven appeal of fixed-income investments has caused bond yields to plummet — so much so that 25 per cent of all government and corporate debt, worth some $16tn, is now negative yielding, up from $6tn last October. This means some investors are prepared to pay borrowers for the privilege of lending them money — and for increasingly longer periods, as the sale of negative yielding German 30-year bonds proved this week.  Is a global recession on the horizon? “This ‘new normal’, is a truly staggering place in which to find ourselves,” says David Absolon, director at Heartwood Investment Management. Investors are willing to buy negative yielding bonds for the potential protection they offer in a downturn — traditionally, bonds have appreciated in value when equities fall — and because they expect they will at least get nearly all their money back on maturity. The indicator that really spooked investors was last week’s yield curve inversion of two- and 10-year US treasuries, meaning short-term borrowing costs are now higher than long-term. This has been a reliable indicator of impending US recessions since the 1950s. “The bond market is sending out the clearest signals about trouble ahead, both the $16tn of bonds currently offering investors a negative yield and the inversion of the yield curve,” says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International. “Investors are concerned that short-term monetary policy is too tight, the risk of recession has risen and the longer-term threat of inflation is reduced.” “Investors are effectively pricing in no credit risk (the risk that the borrower defaults) or interest rate risk (the risk that changing interest rates reduce the relative value of the bond) for the duration of the bond they are buying,” warns Mr Absolon. “Time will tell whether or not this was a wise assumption.”  There are already worrying signs that the trade war is hitting large manufacturing economies. “The latest data out of China and Germany are worrying straws in the wind,” says Mr Stevenson.  The UK yield curve on two and 10-year gilts also inverted last week, casting a shadow over the British economy which is already stuttering as Brexit approaches. Though less reliable a measure of recession than the US one, the development is worrying investors.  “It’s seeming like a hard Brexit is likely,” says Mark Holman, chief executive at TwentyFour Asset Management. “That will push the UK into recession and drag Germany, France, Ireland and Italy down with it, which will be enough to create an EU-wide recession.” Another indicator of bearish investor sentiment is the soaring gold price. The price of the yellow metal rose above $1,500 per troy ounce this month for the first time in six years. Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-largest fund supermarket, reports that trading in gold exchange traded products on its platform has surged three-fold this month compared to July.  How else can investors be affected by negative rates? In times of crisis, investors may well retreat into cash — but in some parts of the world, this offers limited respite from negative rates. Customers with high cash balances are already having to pay some European banks for the privilege. On Tuesday, Danish bank Jyske Bank imposed negative rates on customer deposits over DKr7.5m (£910,500) charging a default rate of 0.6 per cent a year.  In Switzerland, UBS is set to charge 0.75 per cent on individual cash balances above SFr2m (£1.67m) from November and Credit Suisse is widely tipped to follow suit.  Mr Holman thinks it is inevitable that more banks will pass negative interest rates to wealthier customers, unless central banks act to limit the impact of the negative rates on their own balance sheets.  However, those borrowing money will view negative rates differently. Danish lenders have been offering negative mortgage rates since 2015, but Jyske Bank recently unveiled the first sub-zero 10-year home loan that effectively pays customers 0.5 per cent to borrow. Customers still have to make mortgage repayments, but every month, their overall debt is reduced by more than is repaid. They must also pay bank fees to arrange the deal.  How protracted could any downturn be? Historically, the inversion of the US yield curve might have been an accurate predictor of recession — but it is impossible to predict when any slump might actually happen. “There can be a gap of a year or two, and plenty of scope for a ‘melt-up’, particularly if authorities intervene with stimulus measures,” says Ben Seager-Scott, head of multi-asset funds at Tilney Bestinvest.  Other experts wonder if its predictive powers still stand. “Quantitative easing has distorted the shape of the yield curve and very likely means inversion is a much less reliable signal than in the past,” says Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood. “What’s interesting this time is the curve has inverted in the middle of a bull market flattening — as the interest rates were going down — which makes it even more sinister,” says Mr Holman. “I’d say there’s no way that an inverted yield curve is good for the market. The only question is how bad is the bad news.” The more optimistic investors argue that banks are better capitalised than they were ahead of the last downturn. The more pessimistic believe the extended length of the current economic cycle means any potential recession could be more drawn-out than we have previously seen. “Ultra-low interest rates and borrowing costs have led to very prolonged growth and rising asset prices,” says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Group. “That could also mean any downturn will be equally prolonged.”  What could the central banks do? Investors everywhere will be watching this week’s meeting of global policymakers at Jackson Hole for any clues.  More than a third of central banks have cut interest rates in the past six months — the most abrupt shift since 2009, according to Fitch Ratings. This includes the US Federal Reserve, which last month lowered interest rates for the first time since 2008 and hinted at the possibility of further rate cuts. However, analysts are divided on whether this will be enough to see off a global recession. Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management, points out that in times of recession, the Fed has historically cut interest rates by an average of 5 per cent to stimulate growth. With US rates currently at 2.25 per cent, there are obvious limits to monetary policy.  “The Fed hasn’t put enough ammo in the gun, as they’ve never been able to get rates high enough,” Mr McPherson says. “It would be unprecedented for them to go negative, so cutting rates by 5 per cent is likely impossible and that’s why investors are getting jittery.” Mr Holman adds: “If the global trade war continues, no amount of easing would stop a recession. These factors are overshadowing what policymakers can do, and that’s why it’s prudent to be cautious.” A more radical strategy would be for governments to unleash fiscal firepower aimed at boosting growth. Mindful of how an imminent recession could impact his chances of re-election next year, Donald Trump, the US president, said this week he was exploring a range of options for new tax cuts to stimulate the economy. European governments have also hinted they are ready to take action, with Germany reported to be preparing a €50bn stimulus package to boost growth.  As an investor, how can I prepare for volatility?  Many DIY investors have moved into riskier areas of the market to boost returns in recent years, and will need to reassess whether they are still comfortable with their exposure, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.  “You need to budget for the fact that after a 10-year period of bumper returns, things are going to get a little harder from here.” Having reviewed their portfolios, investors may be tempted to take some profits and de-risk by shifting part of their assets into gold, bonds or cash until better opportunities arise. But experts warn than timing the market so that you sell out and buy back in at the right time is near impossible. “The worst days in the market are often followed by the best days,” says Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. “If you get out, you tend to miss the bounce.” For example, investors who sold out of the market last Wednesday when the inverted yield curve caused US equities to fall sharply would have missed out on the subsequent rally that occurred this week. For long-term investors, the solution lies in having a well-diversified portfolio, says Fidelity’s Mr Stevenson. He recommends using multi-asset funds as a low-cost way of spreading risk across asset classes, sectors and regions. “Because we do not have a crystal ball, we can only seek to minimise the ups and downs of our investments by putting our eggs in a variety of baskets.” Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, says absolute return funds are another tool that investors can use to hedge risk. These funds are designed not to lose as much as equities when markets turn, at the cost of not performing as strongly in the good times.  Judging by the latest data, investors are not panicking yet — Morningstar’s alternative multi-strategy funds sector, which include absolute return funds, saw outflows of £877m in July.   What buying opportunities could emerge? Investors are already holding considerable amounts of cash, ready to deploy when markets get choppy. Customers at Interactive Investor have increased their cash balances by 57 per cent on average from the end of 2017 to August 2019, with cash currently making up about 12 per cent of a standard portfolio. Identifying what to spend it on and when to buy are hard decisions to make. Some predict that value investing could make a comeback in the event of a market correction. UK investors don’t have to look far to find unloved companies that trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals — domestic-facing UK stocks such as banks and retailers have seen their valuations battered by the risk of a no-deal Brexit and the weak pound. However, Mr Lowcock warns that not all value stocks will fare well in an economic slowdown. “Housebuilders, for example, could suffer in the initial phase of a recession as could banks, as they benefit from rising interest rates, not falling ones,” he says. Investors unsure of which stocks to pick could turn to value investing funds, including Fidelity’s Special Situations fund, which invests in companies that have suffered a period of underperformance but are tipped to make a turnround. Other fund managers seek defensively positioned companies with a steady stream of dividend income — what Simon Edelsten terms “cockroach stocks”. The manager of the Artemis Mid Wynd trust has been combing the utilities and telecoms sectors for targets and says that the dividend income from these stocks can soften the pain of a bear market. Some DIY investors are focusing their firepower internationally, and remain undeterred by trade war risks. Interactive Investor customers increased their exposure to US equities from 11.2 per cent at the end of 2017 to 14.6 per cent in July 2019, and upped their Asian equity holdings from 0.98 per cent to 1.06 per cent over the same period.  Mark Williams, fund manager of the Liontrust Asia Income fund, says it is possible to beat the currently poorly performing Asian equity markets. His team recently increased Liontrust’s stake in several Taiwanese technology companies with Chinese manufacturing sites after deducing that share price falls overestimated the trade risks. If the fiscal taps are turned on and governments attempt to build their way out of trouble, then infrastructure could have renewed appeal for investors — although investment trusts on this theme trade on average premiums of nearly 14 per cent. After a long period of being trounced by low-cost passive funds, others argue that if markets take a turn for the worse, active fund managers could soon prove their worth.  “It is at times like these that active managers may earn their higher fees to outperform their benchmarks,” says Richard Pearson, director of Selftrade. “However, active managers are not miracle workers, and investors should be mindful that even the experts won’t buck the downward trend if and when it happens.” Decision time for drawdown investors Warning signs of a global recession should be a trigger for those approaching retirement or already drawing on their retirement income to check that their investment strategies are stormproof, writes Josephine Cumbo.
 As a first step, advisers say those nearing retirement should think hard about when they take the tax-free cash available to them, typically a quarter of their pension pot.  Someone with a decent-sized pension pot could reduce its longevity by six or seven years if they took all the tax-free cash at the outset, compared to leaving it all invested, according to research by Quilter, a wealth manager.  However, many pension savers will be keen to take the cash in case stock markets fall further. “You need to consider whether you want to build up more defensive holdings now rather than expose yourself to the risk of the market falling and then withdraw the 25 per cent cash portion,” says Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor.  The picture is more complicated for those in drawdown — taking income from their retirement funds while remaining invested in the stock market — who must consider how volatile markets could affect their investment strategy. One way of managing volatility is adjusting the level of income being drawn. Which? has a very useful drawdown calculator that can help investors model different scenarios based on whether they are taking a high, medium or low investment risk approach. Worryingly, research suggests around one-third of those in drawdown do not know where and how their money is invested.  “Historically, a more diversified portfolio has been shown, over the lifetime of a retirement pot, generally to offer a combination of growth in good markets and downside protection in more volatile periods,” says Helen Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. “A key advantage of a diversified multi-asset portfolio is the ability to seek income-generating investments across regions and asset classes — be that emerging market debt, infrastructure assets, global equities or even alternative asset classes, such as renewable energy.” Before investing in riskier assets, those in retirement should assess whether they have adequate cash reserves to meet future spending needs.  “This ensures they do not become forced sellers during a downturn,” says Kay Ingram, chartered financial planner with LEBC, the advisory firm. “Next, they need to identify essential spending and discretionary spending — and treat the two differently.”","23.08.2019"
"Lyft seeks $23bn valuation in New York IPO","Ride-hailing company looks to raise $2.1bn in biggest US tech listing in 2 years","Lyft, the ride-hailing company, is hitting the road to pitch the biggest US technology listing in two years, as it looks to raise up to $2.1bn at a valuation of almost $23bn. The San Francisco-based company suggested a price range of $62 to $68 per share in an updated filing on Monday to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as it kicked off its investor roadshow. It will use the ticker symbol LYFT when it begins trading on the Nasdaq exchange later this month.   A $22.9bn valuation, at the top of the range and on a fully diluted basis, would peg Lyft’s worth in the range of the market capitalisations of public tech companies including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Twitter and AMD, as well travel groups Hilton and Expedia. It would be the biggest offering by a US tech group since Snap went public in 2017, according to Dealogic. The filing gives the first indication of what ride-sharing companies could be worth in the public markets. Lyft’s IPO is expected to be followed by a public listing from its larger rival Uber as soon as next month, which may fetch a market valuation topping $100bn.  Stuart Bedford, a corporate partner at the law firm Linklaters, said it was hard to value Lyft, since there is no predecessor to compare it to.  “The fact is that they (ride-hailing apps) are not ‘steady state’ businesses, they are all still driving for significant further growth and the battle being fought in the ride-hailing space means it remains hard to predict future revenues,” he said.  But one investor who holds a stake in Uber said the offer was tempting. “I think this is going to trade very well and that will bode very well for Uber.”  The listing will kick off what is expected to be a busy period for technology IPOs with other Silicon Valley stars including Pinterest and Airbnb waiting in the wings.  In Monday’s filing, Lyft said it would offer 30.8m shares, while underwriters have the option to purchase an additional 4.6m shares. JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and Jefferies are the lead bookrunners for the offering.  After expenses, Lyft expects to see net proceeds of about $1.9bn, rising to as much as $2.2bn if the underwriters exercise their purchase options. About 5 per cent of the shares will be offered for sale to some of its longest-serving drivers, who have completed more than 10,000 rides through its app, as well as to Lyft’s directors, certain employees and their friends and family.  At a price of $68 per share, Lyft’s two co-founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, would see the values of their stakes rise to $569m and $393m respectively. They also plan to create a new class of shares carrying 20 votes a piece, which will give them control of 48.8 per cent of voting power, despite their ownership of less than 5 per cent of the company.  Lyft’s largest shareholder, Japanese ecommerce company Rakuten, will hold a stake worth $2.13bn at the high end of the price range. It originally paid $300m for 11.9 per cent of Lyft in 2015 and invested in additional private rounds in 2016 and 2017. General Motors, which invested $500m in 2016, will have a stake worth $1.27bn. Among other top shareholders, Fidelity’s stake will be worth $1.26bn, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz will own a stake worth $1.02bn and Alphabet’s holdings will be worth $872m.  Lyft, which was founded in 2012 and operates in more than 300 cities in the US and Canada, had revenues in the past year of $2.16bn and a net loss of $911.3m.  Lyft kicked off its roadshow in New York on Monday. Executives and bankers will travel to Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Kansas City and other cities to meet potential investors, according to a schedule seen by the Financial Times. The shares are expected to price on March 28 and begin trading the next day. The company’s case to investors will emphasise growth, particularly the increases in active riders and revenue per active rider, according to a video presentation for investors.  The number of active riders — people who have taken at least one ride in the past quarter — rose more than fivefold from 3.5m in early 2016 to 18.6m at the end of 2018. Revenue per active rider more than doubled to $36.04 in that time. “This is a key indicator of our ability to drive usage and monetisation of our platform,” said Brian Roberts, Lyft’s chief financial officer, in the video. Costs have also increased substantially, however, tripling to $3.1bn last year from 2016.","18.03.2019"

"Stocks to watch: Reckitt Benckiser, Plus500, Petrofac, Casino, Kuka","Centrica is unlikely to shake dividend-cut fears this year, says Berenberg","Monday 13:00 GMT What’s happening ● Reckitt Benckiser led the FTSE 100 risers after full-year results from the Nurofen maker came with a pledge to continue with a restructuring plan rather than the major reset to margin targets investors had feared.  RB shares had slipped to a three-year low in January after the surprise retirement of Rakesh Kapoor, its chief executive, raised concerns about a change of strategic direction, including the shelving of a potential break-up. However, Reckitt said it would “continue to evaluate opportunities to maximise shareholder value from RB2.0” and Mr Kapoor’s successor “whether internal or external . . . will be a fit with the distinctive culture of RB and consistent with execution of RB2.0”. After delivering fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, RB said to expect 2019 margins to hold steady and sales to grow between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. While the consensus among analysts had been for 3.5 per cent sales growth and a 40 basis-point margin improvement this year, investors had feared that the margin target would be cut by between 150bp and 250bp, said Morgan Stanley. Its team saw the update as providing “the required clarity and reassurance”. Sellside stories ● Canaccord Genuity repeated “sell” advice on Plus500, the contracts-for-difference broker, with a target cut to 546p from £10.52. Plus500’s results last week were “noteworthy for the disturbing revelation of the extent of unexpected and previously denied profits and losses from client positions over a number of years”, said Canaccord, which argued that the “breakdown in trust between company and investors is a fundamental issue”. Declining earnings, increased regulatory scrutiny “and questions about integrity mean we still see substantial downside from the current price”, said the broker. Canaccord recalled that Plus500 had stated in 2017 and 2016 analyst presentations that its markets activities had delivered “nil” revenue in the 2015, 2016 and 2017 financial years. Canaccord said: “Management may state this was factually correct, ie client losses did not contribute positively to revenues. However, we believe investors are likely to feel aggrieved and possibly misled, particularly in light of the significant founders/PDMR [persons discharging managerial responsibilities] and directors’ share sales in the recent past.”  ● HSBC downgraded Petrofac to “hold” from “buy”. Its move followed David Lufkin, Petrofac’s former head of sales, pleading guilty this month to charges of bribery relating to contract awards in Saudi Arabia and Iraq totalling more than $4bn. The news “represents a material widening of our understanding of the case scope and introduces new uncertainties”, said HSBC, which highlighted that Saudi Arabia was Petrofac’s third-largest Middle East customer. It estimated that a fine of $2.5bn would leave Petrofac worth 355p per share, suggesting the market has priced in up to $2.25bn in penalties and franchise damage.  “The potential expansion of the Serious Fraud Office case has the potential to overshadow the shareholder story over the coming years if a substantial fine is levied and the company franchise is impacted.”HSBC ● Berenberg downgraded Centrica, the British Gas owner, to “hold” from “buy” with a 140p target price. Though a dividend cut “is not the inevitability that Centrica’s circa 9 per cent yield might suggest”, the concerns are unlikely to ease this year as operational problems in nuclear and upstream production continue to put earnings under pressure, it said.  “We do see value here, provided further mishaps can be avoided,” said Berenberg, which put bull- and bear-case valuations on Centrica of 174p and 96p per share. “However, the margins for error have narrowed, risks have increased and the path to an earnings recovery beyond 2019 is far from straightforward.” ● In brief: Aegon raised to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Bovis Homes cut to “hold” at Canaccord; Casino downgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Catena cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Continental raised to “hold” at Berenberg; ConvaTec upgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Kuka upgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Legrand raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Legrand upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Springfield Properties rated new “hold” at Peel Hunt; Sunrise Communications raised to “buy” at Berenberg; Swedish Match upgraded to “buy” at Société Générale.

"Stocks to watch: Inmarsat, Rolls-Royce, Sophos, Bayer, Campari","Dividend risks are growing for Wood Group, says Jefferies","Monday 11:00 GMT What’s happening ● Inmarsat led the FTSE 250 gainers after agreeing to be bought by a private equity consortium led by Apax, its former owner. The terms of the deal — $7.09 a share in cash plus a $0.12 dividend, equivalent to 547p in total — were unchanged from last week’s indicative offer.  Hopes of an improved offer meant Inmarsat was trading slightly above the deal terms, with analysts highlighting that US peer EchoStar would be free to come back after offering 532p a share in cash and stock last year.  Olivetree saw the move by the private-equity consortium to schedule court and shareholder meetings before the end of May as a possible attempt to head off counterbids. However, the broker highlighted that EchoStar’s market value had slid to just $3.4bn, about equal to Inmarsat’s, and that there would be “no real synergies for a strategic buyer over a private equity one”. The likelihood of Charlie Ergen, who controls EchoStar and sister company Dish, competing for Inmarsat as a way to stymie the proposed Ligado Networks’ US mobile network “remains of tail probability only”, Olivetree concluded. ● Rolls-Royce slipped after ValueAct Capital, the activist investor, said it had cut its stake to 9.48 per cent from 10.94 per cent. ValueAct had become Rolls’s biggest shareholder in 2015 and was given a board seat a year later on a promise that it would not publicly lobby for a break-up of the jet engine maker. Sellside stories ● Kepler Cheuvreux and Merrill Lynch downgraded Bayer to “hold” and “neutral” respectively. Both brokers advised clients to avoid Bayer until they had some clarity on the overhang from trials related to its glyphosate herbicide. “Bayer shares do seem to price in too much risk, so for long-term holders we still see value. However, the stock needs a positive catalyst and until the third quarter, we find it hard to see a clear chance of that happening,” said Kepler. Merrill said it continued to forecast a liability to Bayer of $1bn to $5bn, versus $15bn reflected in the share price, but argued that volatility was inevitable when the timing of any resolution was unclear.  Kepler estimated “collateral damage” against Bayer’s valuation at €30bn, even though “precedents suggest that much more than $1m for each of the 11,200 plaintiffs is unlikely”. But “what prevents us from a buy rating right now is that we cannot see where many new buyers might come from, prior to any positive news. The mixed structure of Bayer (50-50 crop [science] and healthcare) means there will be too many reasons for most investors not to invest.” ● JPMorgan Cazenove cut its target price on Sophos, the security software maker, by 10p to 330p and repeated “neutral” advice ahead of full-year results due on May 16. The broker said to expect a change to forward guidance including no update on cash earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, management’s favoured metric of profitability since flotation in 2015.  “By our understanding, Sophos may cease providing billings and cash ebitda guidance and shift to the more traditional revenue and operating profit guidance. While we are disappointed that the company will no longer provide the outlook for billings, we also note that recent misses suggest visibility was limited and quarterly volatility was high, and thus the company is shifting to revenue guidance, where it can more reliably provide outlook.”JPMorgan ● Jefferies downgraded John Wood, the oil services engineer, to “underperform” from “hold” with a 480p target price. It cited increasing risk to Wood’s dividend. Bolt-on mergers and acquisitions have been key both for Wood and for Amec Foster Wheeler, the peer it bought in 2017, Jefferies said. Management now needed to deliver disposals and cut debt but timing appeared uncertain, and “messy” 2018 results showed how much underlying performance had been obscured by adjustments and exceptionals, the broker argued.  Jefferies concluded that Wood’s reported earnings “has to be a function of valuation as frankly it is one of the few consistent measures we have”: it forecast 2019 net income of $74m, compared with a $193m consensus profit.  ● In brief: Austrian Post cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Campari raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; ConvaTec raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Dechra rated new “overweight” at JPMorgan; Diageo downgraded to “sell” at Investec; FirstGroup upgraded to “buy” at Investec; Fuller Smith & Turner rated new “buy” at Stifel; Hermes International cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Intertrust raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Kingfisher cut to “neutral” at Redburn; Mitchells & Butlers rated new “hold” at Stifel; National Express cut to “hold” at Investec; Primary Health cut to “hold” at Liberum; Restaurant Group rated new “buy” at Stifel; Schneider raised to “buy” at UBS; Spie cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Soco raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; SSP rated new “hold” at Stifel; Standard Chartered raised to “buy” at Investec; UBS upgraded to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; United Utilities cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Wacker Chemie downgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Young & Co rated new “buy” at Stifel.

"Banks fret over investor inaction on Brexit","Few clients have returned documents allowing them to trade smoothly in event of no-deal","Leading banks have appealed for help from regulators after as few as 10 per cent of clients returned paperwork allowing them to trade smoothly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Banks have spent months asking investor clients to sign trading agreements with their new EU-based brokerages so that they can trade seamlessly and efficiently across Europe if the UK crashes out of the bloc without a deal. The biggest issues are in derivatives, where contracts are complex and bespoke.  But client take-up has been slow. At Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, just 10 per cent of affected clients have returned the necessary documents, people familiar with the situation told the FT. At Citi, documents have been returned by 15 to 20 per cent of the clients the bank is trying to migrate to its Frankfurt broker-dealer, while Swiss banks have also had low sign-up levels, people familiar with those banks’ processes said.  “Clients have not been in a rush to re-paper,” said the head of one US investment bank, who believes clients are not responding with urgency because they do not foresee a no-deal Brexit. Asset managers have a backlog of documents to work through and sometimes they don’t have enough specialist lawyers and that creates bottlenecksPolicy expert in the UK asset management industry Banks also believe an orderly transition period is the most likely outcome. But they must plan for all eventualities, especially since the UK parliament overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal deal negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May. The slow response rate from investors has banks worrying about an avalanche of paperwork landing all at once in March, which might not be processed in time for the UK’s exit date on the 29th of that month. Without it, lawyers fear there could be restrictions to services connected to about £18tn of existing swaps. Users may also face higher trading costs and reporting requirements when they open new derivatives positions from April. With the clock running down, at least three banks have asked the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority to see if they could intervene to speed up investors’ responses.  “We complained to the FCA, (we asked them) can you please encourage them to do this, and they told us every bank is saying the same thing,” said a senior executive at one large bank. “The FCA has a duty of care to clients.”  The FCA declined to comment, as did Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse.  Monica Gogna, a partner with the law firm Dechert in London, who represents large and mid-sized asset managers, said there was “some inertia on both sides due to the impasse on Brexit”. “Clients are very focused on making sure all of their documentation is correct,” she added.   A policy expert working in the UK asset management industry said one likely reason for the delays was a lack of specialist resources. “Asset managers have a backlog of documents to work through and sometimes they don’t have enough specialist lawyers and that creates bottlenecks,” he said. He added that when new ISDA agreements for derivatives and swaps are required, brokers sometimes use that as an opportunity to slip in price rises and changes to protection terms. “Those changes require a negotiation between the broker and the asset manager and that causes delays,” he said. One of the bankers said investors’ response rates were not helped by the fact that there was no standardised process across the industry for revising trading arrangements. This meant investors have to wade through lots of documents, which vary slightly from bank to bank depending on their post-Brexit structures. Barclays’, for example, does not have to get its clients to sign new documents because it has transferred the ownership of its EU-based branches to a Dublin-based subsidiary.

"Opening Quote: Boohoo and Primark thrive as young shoppers spend, spend, spend!","Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what’s happening in the markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email. Primark and Boohoo both sell own-brand, cheap clothes to young people, with savvy digital marketing. But beyond that they are very different businesses (and to be fair, trade on vastly different multiples).  Boohoo is an online retailer that turns out the latest trends on ultra-quick turnround times. Primark looks much more like an old-fashioned retailer. It has no online store (though a popular webpage), owns a hefty chunk of its real estate and has far longer lead times on its merchandise.  Both reported results today: half-yearly figures for Primark-owner Associated British Foodsand full-year ones for Boohoo. And both strategies appear to be working. Primark had profits for the 24 weeks to the start of March up 25 per cent year-on-year as operating margins were boosted by a weaker US dollar. The dollar effect on margins should dissipate in the second half of the year, as ABF has hedged its foreign exchange exposure, but in the first half better buying, stock management and fewer markdowns also helped.  Boohoo, meanwhile, reported revenues that topped its latest increased guidance, up 48 per cent year-on-year. Revenues at its fastest growing label, PrettyLittleThing, more than doubled, and its smaller brand Nasty Gal came within a whisker of that. Pre-tax profits were almost 40 per cent higher and underlying margins ticked up.  The challenges both face are unsurprisingly different. Primark has to solve reputational and management problems in Germany, which have dragged on sales. Like-for-like sales were 1.5 per cent lower in the latest period, though that was better than the 2 per cent fall it had flagged in an earlier trading update. It says it is making progress. On the other hand, Boohoo has to work out how to transition to a more mature company as the pace of growth slows — it expects 25-30 per cent growth in the new financial year, and an increase in capital expenditure from £47m to between £50m and £60m. It recently turned to none other than Primark — more specifically the bricks-and-mortar retailer's former chief operating officer John Lyttle — to lead that process as new chief executive. Briefly Seven weeks after Aviva tapped company insider Maurice Tulloch to be its new chief executive, the boss of its UK insurance division is out. Andy Briggs will remain at the group until 23 October, but steps down from his executive and board role immediately. Tulloch will now lead a review of the UK businesses “to ensure the appropriate management structure to build on [their] success for the future”. Aviva will also expand its senior leadership team to include Colm Homes, the chief executive of its Canadian business and Patrick Dixneuf, who becomes CEO of Aviva's European businesses on top of his role as head of Aviva France. UK shopping centre landlords including British Land, Landsec, Hammerson and Intu are heavily exposed to struggling retailers and CVAs according to an analysis by UBS.

We were recognised for best business newsletter at a major publication, we launched a new members forum in London on Tuesday (pictured) and now the briefing turns two years old today.

Finally, look out for a lot more in the coming months . . . we’re just getting started. — Arash, JFK and the whole DD team
 Yesterday we talked about auto deals, which like London buses seem to want to come in threes. Today we need to talk about a trio of changes that all stunned the market in the past 48 hours. First, there was the news on Wednesday that Barclays’ investment banking boss Tim Throsby was ousted after barely two years in the job. The story of his exit is the basis of this wonderful read by the FT’s Stephen Morris, which starts with this intro: When Tim Throsby worked at JPMorgan Chase, he had a reputation among colleagues as “a bull in a china shop”. After taking charge of Barclays’ investment bank two years ago he decorated his office with a vast painting of a naked Minotaur. Late on Thursday, there was even bigger news. Tim Sloan, chief executive of embattled US banking giant Wells Fargo, announced he will retire on June 30. The bank’s board has appointed its general counsel, C Allen Parker, as his interim replacement. This comes two years after the bank was drawn into a huge scandal over the opening of fake accounts and political pressure has been piling up. Sloan’s exit was capped off by news that Morgan Stanley’s number two, Colm Kelleher, is heading out too. The Irish-native, who cut his teeth as a trader at Morgan Stanley’s fixed income business, will finish up at the end of June and become a senior adviser to the firm. Here’s a snippet of the memo by MS’s chief executive James Gorman to “all employees”:  Oh, we were about to forget: Birgitte Bonnesen, the chief executive of Swedbank, has also been fired by the Swedish bank’s board, paying the price for a rapidly escalating €135bn money laundering scandal. Her role will be replaced temporarily by chief financial officer Anders Karlsson. Read more in the FT about the departures of Sloan here; Kelleher here; and Bonnesen here. (Also check out this excellent profile of Kelleher and his obsession for, among other things, office dress codes, by Olivia Oran — at the time at Reuters, now at Business Insider). The M&A party can go on, at least for a while longer Why is all this banking news coming at the end of the first quarter? It could be an ominous sign for upcoming first-quarter results. But figures for mergers and acquisitions are up considerably, as shown below.  Still, when a banker tells you that she’s having a mixed year, be aware, trouble may lay ahead. That’s exactly what veteran JPMorgan Chase rainmaker Anu Aiyengar told us as she described the state of M&A so far this year. Why has it been mixed? “We’ve been very happy in terms of big deals but we need more deals overall,” said the head of M&A in North America for JPM. Mega deals did prop up the M&A market in the first quarter of the year. If it wouldn’t have been for 11 double-digit deals — think Bristol-Myers Squibb taking over Celgene for $90bn, or Saudi Aramco buying a $69bn majority stake in petrochemicals group Sabic — we’d be writing of the collapse in dealmaking activity. With $927bn worth of deals agreed so far, the first quarter of 2019 is officially the second strongest start to a year for M&A since the turn of the century. In contrast the number of transactions dropped by a third from a year ago to 8,765 deals, the lowest in more than a decade. What does this mean? Is the party over? What’s on CEOs’ minds? You can find most of the answers here.  Still need a teaser? OK, here you go. “Everyone is talking about a recession,” said Jennifer Perkins, corporate partner at Kirkland & Ellis. Yes, recession. Why? “What happened in December, when the markets slowed down and credit tightened, shocked a lot of people. It made people think: ‘Oh god, the good times might not last’,” said Aiyengar. Does this mean dealmaking will slow down going forward? Maybe. It depends. To get the full lowdown on the state of M&A go here. A wing and a prayer  “Grabbing the Buddha’s feet in an emergency” is the Chinese saying for last-minute efforts to extricate yourself from trouble. HNA, the aviation-to-finance conglomerate that flavours its business with Buddhism, is selling even its airline businesses as it tries to extricate itself from massive debt incurred in a major international spending binge.  HNA originally told both Beijing and investors that it’d navigate out of the problem by selling property and other non-core assets, while keeping its air travel business. That business strategy isn’t quite as convincing as it sounds. So far it has sold about $40bn but the debt pile it’s trying to fix is about twice that large, according to DD’s best approximation. The total value of HNA’s assets is an open question, since land values in China are notoriously murky and its financial platforms are heavily encumbered with debt raised from Chinese individuals. The FT story is here. Bond investors, at least, seem to be questioning the logic. HNA subsidiaries had a rough time issuing new bonds in March, and delayed payment on one maturing instrument. Some credit agencies have stopped covering HNA debt as their customers lose appetite. HNA’s co-founder Chen Feng is known for giving out sutras and filling HNA’s headquarters on Hainan island with prayer nooks. Even the building is designed like a Buddha. Chen has been in tight spots before. But it remains to be seen if he can wing his way out of this one. Job moves DD exclusive: Credit Suisse has hired David Krap as head of Northern European M&A, according to an internal memo seen by DD and confirmed by a CS spokesperson. Krap was most recently a managing director at Centerview Partners, where he had worked since 2014. Before that, he was at UBS. His hire marks a rare departure of a banker returning from a boutique to a big bank.

Barclays has hired Kristin DeClark to join its US technology equity capital markets team in San Francisco. She joins from Deutsche Bank.

"Nvidia to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox for $6.9bn ","All-cash deal aims to boost US group’s focus on data centres","Nvidia on Monday agreed to buy rival Mellanox Technologies for $6.9bn, including debt, in the biggest deal ever for the US semiconductor company as it seeks to bolster its business in data centres. The all-cash deal would help Nvidia shift its focus away from the gaming industry, which has been hit by slowing economic growth in China and the waning cryptocurrency fervour. Nvidia said it would pay $125 a share for Mellanox, a 14 per cent premium to the group’s closing share price on Friday. The chipmaker beat Intel in a competitive race to secure Mellanox, which is based in both the US and Israel, said one person involved in the bidding process. Intel is one of the biggest foreign investors in Israel. Just two months ago, the chipmaker announced plans for a $11bn production and research facility in the country. Intel purchased Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based maker of sensors and cameras for computer-assisted and autonomous driving, for $15.3bn in 2017.  Mellanox, which reported sales of $1.1bn last year, makes cables and switches that transfer data between servers, storage systems and infrastructure equipment. The technology will complement Nvidia’s graphics processors, which despite their origins in visual effects and computer games, are increasingly used in machine learning systems.  “The emergence of [artificial intelligence] and data science, as well as billions of simultaneous computer users, is fuelling skyrocketing demand on the world’s data centres,” said Jensen Huang, the founder and chief executive of Nvidia. “This type of workload is simply too big to fit on any one computer . . . Thousands of computers have to be networked together.”  The two companies said the combined entity will serve every big provider of cloud computing services and power more than half the world’s fastest supercomputers, with customers such as Dell, Google owner Alphabet and IBM.  Nvidia and Mellanox have partnered for several years, but acquisition talks began only recently, Mr Huang said on a conference call on Monday morning.  “We would like to accelerate growth into data centres by being able to architect across both the compute as well as the network fabric,” he said, saying the deal was part of a broader strategy to change Nvidia “from a chip and system-level company to a data centre-scale company”.  The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2019, and will be funded by cash on Nvidia’s balance sheet. The deal will require regulatory approval in the US, China and other jurisdictions, Nvidia said.   Nvidia generated roughly a quarter of its $11.7bn of revenues from its data centre business last year, which was dwarfed by its sales to gamers who want to supercharge their PCs. The company faced a turbulent end to 2018 as its gaming division’s sales slid, driven in large part by a slump in sales of graphics cards to cryptocurrency miners.  Nvidia has said it expects return to growth in its core gaming business in the quarter ending in July, but has warned of limited visibility among cloud computing clients. Executives warned investors and analysts earlier this year that its total revenues in 2019 would be flat or decline. Shares of the California-based company have declined 48 per cent from a record high hit last October.   Mellanox competes primarily with Intel in the market for a specialised form of networking technology designed for high-end servers and supercomputers, called InfiniBand.  The InfiniBand standard was originally developed in the late 1990s during the dotcom boom, but adoption stagnated after the bubble burst. Mellanox also sells Ethernet networking technology, which is more widely used across PCs and data centres.  The $12bn-a-year high-performance computing market caters primarily to clients in bio-sciences, aviation, defence, government and academic research. Hyperion Research, which tracks the HPC market, predicts the HPC market to grow to around $20bn by 2022. “Where compute starts and networking starts and ends is going to become harder to see,” Mr Huang said. “The entire data centre becomes one giant compute engine.” The transaction is a win for activist investor Starboard Value, which had bought more than a tenth of Mellanox and called for the company to explore a deal to bolster its share price. The activist sold some of its position after Mellanox last year agreed to add new directors to its board, but it remains the company’s largest stockholder, according to data provider Refinitiv. Mark Lipacis, an analyst with investment bank Jefferies, said he viewed the takeover “favourably” for Nvidia, writing that Mellanox technology was “uncorking the bandwidth bottleneck between large amounts of data and the processors that process them”. Nvidia shares rose 1 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday to $152. Mellanox gained 9 per cent to $118.93.  Goldman Sachs provided advice to Nvidia while Jones Day served as legal counsel. Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase advised Mellanox and law firms Latham & Watkins and Herzog Fox & Neeman offered legal advice to the company.","11.03.2019"
"Diminishing returns: hedge funds look to keep it in the family","Lower income and higher costs are forcing some funds to close, but others are shunning outsiders to look after their own money","© FT montage / Bloomberg / Dreamstime When the financial storm clouds started to darken in 2007, John Paulson, a little-known hedge fund manager who had been prescient enough to stock up on the equivalent of umbrellas, racked up one of the biggest hauls in investing history. Wildly lucrative bets against housing-backed bonds and banks netted Paulson & Co an estimated $20bn over the course of the financial crisis, and turned Mr Paulson into a superstar of the hedge fund industry. Investors desperate to profit from his golden touch lifted the assets of Paulson & Co, previously a small outfit specialising in more humdrum strategies such as trading around acquisitions, to a peak of $38bn in 2011.  However, a decade later, Mr Paulson is now considering whether to close his eponymous hedge fund and convert it into a so-called “family office” dedicated only to managing his own wealth. For former masters of the universe it is the professional equivalent of buying sweatpants, moving to Florida and filing for social security.   A long string of failed bets and fizzled trades on the likes of gold, healthcare stocks, banks, pharmaceuticals and German government bonds has deflated Paulson & Co’s assets under management to about $8.7bn, of which over three-quarters is its founder’s own fortune. This week Mr Paulson admitted he would consider whether to turn his hedge fund into a family office “in the next year or two”. “Most people eventually, when they get to this level, they do make a decision,” Mr Paulson recently told a podcast hosted by Broome Street Capital founder Michael Samuels. “Do they want to get bigger and, you know, create a bigger business of managing money [or opt to] make their life easier and morph into a family office?”
 He is not alone. Rising pressures on fees, mounting regulatory and investor scrutiny and a trading environment that has tripped up many managers have caused several industry grandees to convert hedge funds into family offices — in practice private, unregistered hedge funds with no outside investors. Steve Cohen was forced to turn his hedge fund into a family office by US regulators after an insider trading scandal in 2016 © Bloomberg George Soros, BlueCrest’s Michael Platt and Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors are among the prominent industry figures who have done so since the crisis. But many more have simply closed down, too small to be able to survive as standalone family offices. 
 “The general trends of the industry are shocking,” says Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager at GLG Partners, who now runs Real Vision, an online TV station focused on the industry. “The old saying was that there were more hedge fund managers than Taco Bell managers, but it’s now shifting in favour of Taco Bell.” Every hedge fund closure or conversion is unique. For Mr Platt, the brash British trader who founded BlueCrest, it was about shedding the shackles imposed by more cautious institutional investors, while Highfields Capital’s Jonathon Jacobson simply got tired after “three-and-a-half decades of sitting in front of a screen”.  Stanley Druckenmiller, who established his reputation by breaking the back of the British pound in 1992 with his mentor Mr Soros at Quantum Fund, threw in the towel in August 2010. “I have had to recognise that competing in the markets over such a long timeframe imposes heavy personal costs,” he wrote. 
 Leon Cooperman said he decided to close his fund after seeing the light at a concert by  Kenny Rogers, above © AFP Mr Cooperman turned Omega Advisors into a family office after turning 75, having a brush with the US Securities and Exchange Commission — the company paid $4.9m to settle an insider trading case — and seeing the light at a Kenny Rogers concert. 
 “He [Rogers] had great difficulty in getting around the stage and acknowledged that, at almost 80, he shouldn’t be performing any longer, but that he’d been divorced four times and needed the money! Well, I’ve been happily married to the same woman for 54 years, don’t need the money and know when to fold ’em,” Mr Cooperman wrote in his final letter to investors.  However, there are some common trends that are putting pressure on the industry, causing many smaller funds to close their doors and encouraging some better-established ones with wealthy founders to convert into family offices. Returns have been slowly fading for some time. Hedge funds have made 3.4 per cent on average a year since 2010, compared with 6.4 per cent in the previous decade and 18.3 per cent in their 1990s heyday, according to HFR’s fund-weighted composite index.  Some sceptics attribute this to stricter rules on corporate disclosure since the bursting of the dotcom bubble, and a crackdown on 
insider trading. Others point to the sheer number of fund managers who have emerged, making it harder to generate market-beating “alpha” returns. More recently, many blame the rise of quantitative investors and high-frequency traders, arguing markets have become more confusing. Hedge fund managers, meanwhile, cite the rising importance of more cautious pension fund investors, who want steadier, less volatile returns than those favoured by the wealthy jet-set that dominated the industry’s investor base in its early years.   Regardless of the root cause, many investors have become disenchanted, with only buoyant markets masking periodic outflows and keeping the industry’s global size constant at roughly $3tn. At the same time, investors are becoming far more demanding, asking for cheaper strategies and negotiating lower fees on existing ones.  The industry historically charged “two and 20”, or a 2 per cent annual management fee and 20 per cent of profits, a structure that Mr Paulson admitted was his favourite aspect of the business. When returns are good and assets grow, “the fees just pour out of the sky”, he said. George Soros is among the prominent industry figures who converted their hedge funds into family offices since the financial crisis © Reuters However, only 3 per cent of hedge funds now charge a 2 per cent management fee and 16 per cent take a fifth of profits, according to Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank estimates that the average management fee is now 1.45 per cent, and the performance fee 16.9 per cent. 
 At the same time, the expenses involved are mounting, says Jaynita Sodhi, co-head of US capital services at Credit Suisse. “It’s become incredibly onerous,” she says. “It used to be a Bloomberg terminal and a garage, but now you need a chief operating officer, compliance staff and an investor relations department. The costs are high.”  For a wealthy hedge fund manager, suffering a bad spell and seeing investor money gush out, the decision to rid themselves of the regulatory, compliance and transparency headaches that come with managing other people’s money can be tempting.  “Investors are the lifeblood of our industry, but they are a pain,” admits one hedge fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They don’t really understand what we do, but feel the need to quiz us all the time to fulfil their fiduciary duty.” Last year 580 hedge funds out of a global total of about 11,000 closed down, according to Eurekahedge, outnumbering launches for a third year running. 


 
In spite of the industry’s difficulties, the family office is not a path chosen by many. The desire to prove oneself, the thrill of managing vast amounts of money and the huge financial incentives for the best managers mean that shutting the door to outside investors remains rare. Moreover, hiring the best traders and portfolio managers can be difficult without the fees, growth and attention that come with managing money for outside investors.  And although challenged, the industry is not collapsing. Underscoring how top managers can still dictate terms to investors, the proportion of funds charging “pass-through” fees — costs like research or technology that are passed on to investors — has actually risen since 2010 on an asset-weighted basis, according to Aurum Fund Management.  Perhaps most tellingly, Steve Cohen — who was forced to turn his hedge fund into a family office by US regulators after an insider trading scandal in 2016 — reopened to outside investors as quickly as possible. Last year he raised $5bn for Point 72’s new fund, charging a management fee of 2.75 per cent and up to 30 per cent of profits.  Stanley Druckenmiller, who established his reputation by breaking the back of the British pound in 1992 with his mentor Mr Soros at Quantum Fund, threw in the towel in August 2010 © Bloomberg John Paulson’s fall from grace has generated a fair bit of schadenfreude. Many see him as an M&A arbitrageur who stumbled on the bet of a lifetime — admittedly one executed to perfection — and then imagined himself to be a master of all markets and investment styles.  At 63, it would be natural to step back a little, but in a statement to the FT Mr Paulson says he still has “every intention” of continuing to manage investor money. “In many ways, Paulson & Co has been a hybrid family office for some time, since we’ve always had the unique advantage of managing meaningful amounts of partner capital alongside external investor capital,” he says. “Most investors have found this to be a benefit.”  For Michael Platt, the brash British trader who founded BlueCrest, closing his fund was about shedding the shackles imposed by more cautious institutional investors  Mr Paulson says his hedge fund “has had a long and positive track record dating back to 1994” and continued to grow its merger-arbitrage strategies, all of which “are profitable”. 
 “Our credit fund has also performed well over time and is generating positive performance. Our co-investment platform is another area of growth for the firm and we continue to source new and interesting opportunities,” the hedge fund manager says.  Yet regardless of Paulson & Co’s future, ultimately the main takeaway for fellow hedge fund managers and their investors might be that excellence in one field does not translate into omnipotence in others. As one rival hedge fund manager quips: “Just because Louis Armstrong could play the trumpet doesn’t mean he would be good at the cello.”","25.01.2019"
"Takeda seeks to divest $10bn of assets after £46bn Shire deal","Japanese pharmaceutical group eyes reduction in $48bn debt pile following acquisition","Takeda will consider selling businesses from its Nycomed acquisition in 2011, as Japan’s largest pharmaceutical group seeks to divest $10bn of assets after completing a £46bn deal to buy Shire.  Christophe Weber, chief executive, said Nycomed was among the company’s “non-core assets” that it could consider jettisoning but denied that the $13.7bn acquisition of the Swiss drugmaker had been a flop, as some analysts have suggested.  Investors in Takeda have called for more clarity on the planned disposal of assets, which will be critical for the group in reducing $48bn in net debt that it will shoulder from buying Shire.  Mr Weber said in an interview at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco that his company had hundreds of brands outside its focus areas that he could sell if he could find buyers with a better strategic fit.  To simplify the business, Takeda will focus on five core areas: oncology, gastrointestinal conditions, neuroscience, rare diseases and plasma-derived therapies.  “The overall environment is demanding more innovative medicine,” he said.  Takeda bought Swiss drugmaker Nycomed, which included Daxas, a treatment for lung conditions, and a portfolio of over-the-counter medicines in 2011 in a bid to expand its presence in emerging markets such as Russia. But market conditions deteriorated following the acquisition, and analysts had long criticised Nycomed’s operations as a “black box” for Takeda.  “As a business, it was a failure and the acquisition was not necessary,” said Fumiyoshi Sakai, an analyst at Credit Suisse, adding that the company was likely to sell Nycomed’s OTC business in Russia.  Other brands deemed outside the core areas include Azilva, a blood pressure medicine, Nesina, for diabetics, and Uloric, which is used to treat patients with gout.  The troubles Takeda faced with Nycomed could be relevant for its integration of Shire, but the company has changed significantly since its last major acquisition.  Our long-term ambition is to have a very productive research and development engineChristophe Weber, chief executive, Takeda Under Mr Weber, the first non-Japanese CEO of the 237-year-old group, the company is led by an international executive team and the organisation is much leaner following an aggressive cost-cutting programme.  “The management needs to take this [Shire] acquisition and make sure that they drive improvement in profitability,” said Alessandro Valentini, a portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management, which has been a longtime investor in Takeda.  Critics have expressed concern that the acquisition may end up being one in a string of large deals needed to sustain Takeda’s drugs pipeline.  “Shire’s assets will run out in 10 years,” Mr Sakai said. “Takeda basically bought five years’ worth of time through this deal. If their efforts don’t bear fruit at the end of that period, they may need to do another major acquisition.”  But Mr Weber rejected the idea that Takeda might do a Shire-sized deal every five years. He said he was “confident” the acquisition would drive “long-term, highly innovative and sustainable” growth.  “Our long-term ambition is to have a very productive research and development engine,” he said, adding that Takeda has 21 assets in phase two and three drug trials. Phase three is the largest and most important stage for proving a drug’s efficacy.","09.01.2019"
"Honda investors back carmaker’s decision to close UK plant","Shares rise and analysts laud Japanese group’s ‘clear decision making’","Honda’s decision to close its Swindon plant has shaken confidence in the future of UK car manufacturing, but it has won acclaim from the Japanese carmaker’s investors.  Since last week’s announcement, Honda shares have risen 5 per cent. Analysts at Morgan Stanley MUFG lauded management’s “clear decision making”, while Nomura upgraded the stock from neutral to buy and raised its target price by 13 per cent.  Honda’s plan to close the struggling plant west of London comes at a pivotal moment ahead of the UK’s departure from the EU.  But for investors, the closure provides a much-needed breath of fresh air for a company that has been struggling since its expansion policy backfired in the wake of the global financial crisis a decade ago.  An aggressive pursuit of market share left Honda saddled with excess capacity, which ate into its profitability and suppressed the creativity of its engineers. Sales in Europe have steadily declined, falling 53 per cent over the past decade.   Analysts say the Swindon closure caps a series of fixes Takahiro Hachigo has implemented since he took over as chief executive in 2015, aimed at making the carmaker nimbler and faster to keep pace with big changes in the industry.  The pace of change, however, has been frustrating for investors, who have sent Honda’s shares down 26 per cent during Mr Hachigo’s time at the helm.  “Since Mr Hachigo took over, he has mostly been preoccupied with rectifying the global expansion policy pursued by his predecessor. Swindon is the final phase of his reforms,” said Yoshio Tsukuda, a former motor journalist who now heads his own research firm Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute.  The closure of its plants in the UK and Turkey in 2021, along with its plan to shut an ageing assembly plant in Japan in the same year, will reduce Honda’s global production capacity from 5.4m units to 5.1m units. Nomura estimates that these plant closures will boost operating profits by ¥60bn ($542m) a year from the 2021-22 fiscal year.  The profit boost is much needed as Honda faces tougher market conditions in US and China. In the latest quarter, its car business eked out a meagre operating profit margin of 1.4 per cent, compared with 13.5 per cent generated by its motorcycle business.   Despite strong denials from Mr Hachigo, people close to Honda say the company’s decision on Swindon would not have happened without the Brexit backdrop and the landmark trade deal Japan signed with the EU, which will result in tariffs dropping to zero by 2027. But while Brexit made the commercial case for a closure even stronger, Honda’s unprecedented move to close its overseas car plant reflects the broader competitive challenge it faces.  “Even during difficult times, Honda persevered by compensating losses at Swindon with profits from elsewhere. But that’s no longer possible,” said a senior industry executive with close knowledge of Honda’s operations.  What Honda's Swindon factory closure means for UK carmaking  Critics say Honda’s decades-long struggle to make meaningful headway in Europe has little to do with the political turmoil in the UK.  Overshadowed by the strength of German rivals, Honda has only a tiny share in Europe. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimate that its European business is operating in the red in underlying terms, excluding tax adjustments.  “It almost seemed as if Honda was masking the failure of its European strategy amid this Brexit turmoil,” said Koji Endo, head of the equity research department at SBI Securities.  Honda’s history in Europe is fraught with miscalculations. Its ambitions to expand into Europe — using the Swindon plant as a gateway — were badly shaken after its alliance with Rover Group fell apart when the British car manufacturer was sold to German rival BMW in 1994.  After clashing with Rover over quality control and cost management, Honda walked away from the experience with a strong view that tie-ups were difficult.  “Rover was Honda’s gateway to Europe. When its capital tie-up with Rover failed, it became a big trauma for Honda. It was also the reason why the company took a go-at-it-alone approach from then on,” said Mr Tsukuda.  Since Mr Hachigo came on board, Honda has begun to look again at tie-ups, forming a partnership with General Motors of the US to develop self-driving vehicles.  Mr Hachigo has stressed that the Swindon closure does not signal a retreat from Europe, saying it made more sense to supply hybrids and electric vehicles to Europe from China and Japan, instead of making them locally.  “The shift towards electrification could be an opportunity for us to give it another try in Europe,” he said at a news conference last week.","25.02.2019"
"Tesco braces for Brexit by renting frozen food containers","UK’s biggest supermarket group adds to storage space to ease potential disruption","Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket group, is renting refrigerated containers for the remainder of the year to increase the amount of frozen food it can store and mitigate some of the potential disruption from a disorderly Brexit.  A communication from Tesco to store managers seen by the Financial Times states that refrigerated containers used to supplement supermarkets’ existing frozen storage space over the busy Christmas period “are now planned to stay on site for the rest of the year as part of a contingency plan due to Brexit”. It added that the plan “is currently being finalised.” One major supplier of the containers confirmed that Tesco and some other retailers had asked to keep several hundred of the containers, which hold the equivalent of 10 pallets of merchandise each, for at least the rest of the year. “Ordinarily we would have picked them up by now,” the supplier said. Several other suppliers of the containers said they had seen an increase in inquiries relating to Brexit, but that had not yet translated into orders. Tesco, which also retained some temporary storage last year, declined to comment but the company’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, told reporters last week that the company was “working with our suppliers to think through sensible opportunities to improve stockholding closer to the market”.  “We’ll utilise the space that we have where that makes sense,” he added. Mr Lewis and other chief executives in the consumer sector have until recently remained tight-lipped about the details of Brexit planning, although some senior figures in the industry have taken part in prime minister’s “town hall” meetings with business figures and made clear their desire for an orderly exit from the EU. Wm Morrison said it had not hired additional units. Morrison’s supply chain is more vertically integrated than its main UK rivals. J Sainsbury also said it was “not currently holding any extra cold storage”. Additional container storage is only generally viable in larger stores with the requisite parking space.  Food retailers would be among the hardest hit of any sector if the UK were to leave the EU at the end of March without a withdrawal agreement.  Roughly a third of the UK’s food is imported from the EU, including large amounts of fresh produce, and the British Retail Consortium has previously warned of “food rotting at ports” if a no-deal Brexit results in additional customs checks. In a letter to the prime minister and the EU last year, it said frictionless trade allows soft fruit to arrive in the UK and still have a shelf life of about five days. Although Marks and Spencer and Tesco have recently said they are stockpiling some tinned and packeted items with longer shelf lives, retailers have repeatedly told government ministers and civil servants that substantial additional storage capacity is impractical. Without further inward deliveries, many regional distribution centres can only supply their store networks for about a week.  Analysts at Credit Suisse estimated last year that a hard Brexit could increase the wholesale cost of food by more than 5 per cent; this included estimated costs for tariffs, non-tariff barriers, additional labour and a weaker currency. Given their already-thin margins, the analysts said retailers would be forced to pass on at least some of the additional costs to customers in the form of higher prices.

"Stocks to watch: Renault, Avast, Debenhams, Inditex, GVC, Enagas","Online competition should not threaten Pets at Home’s turnround plan, says Citigroup","Wednesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● European automakers were in demand after the Financial Times reported that Renault aims to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months as a first step towards acquiring another carmaker, with Fiat Chrysler among the preferred targets. The recent creation of the new alliance board at Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi has improved confidence about executing the merger plans, the report said.   ● Ladbrokes owner GVC led the UK bookmakers higher after Kenny Alexander reiterated that he was committed to the business in the long term and would not sell any more shares while chief executive. GVC had slumped 20 per cent earlier this month after Mr Alexander and Lee Feldman, group chairman, raised a total of £20m with share sales. “We have had an excellent start to the year and I look forward to updating on progress in our first-quarter trading update on April 5 and at the capital markets day on May 16,” Mr Alexander added in a footnote to a statement detailing management bonus awards.  ● Avast led the FTSE 250 fallers after pre-float backer CVC Capital Partners sold nearly half its stake in the virus protection software maker. The placing, which came via CVC’s Sybil Holdings fund, was priced at a 4.3 per cent discount to Tuesday’s closing price at 284p a share.  ● Debenhams bounced after Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, its biggest shareholder, said it was weighing up a takeover offer at 5p in cash per share that would value the department store operator at £61.4m, or a 127 per cent premium to Tuesday’s market value. The offer was conditional on Mr Ashley becoming Debenhams’s chief executive and the company scrapping its rescue plan. A consent from debtholders on the current plan is due by 5pm Thursday. “For remaining equity shareholders, stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place, an offer, even of just 5p, might, in the face of potentially zero value under some of the restructuring options Debenhams is considering, be the preferred option. We think the pressure is now on Debenhams to find a restructuring plan that doesn’t involve wiping equity shareholders out completely.”Jefferies Dealers also noted that Odey Asset Management had raised its stake in Debenhams to 5.23 per cent, up from 2.92 per cent disclosed on Tuesday. Odey also reported an unchanged short position on Debenhams shares of 7.87 per cent.  ● Swedbank was the Stoxx 600’s sharpest faller in response to news that its headquarters was raided by the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, which has been investigating the Baltic money-laundering scandal. The raid followed a Swedish television report that linked Swedbank to “high risk non-resident flows” totalling €135bn through Estonia in the decade to 2018 and suggested that the lender may have withheld information from US investigators.  Sellside stories ● JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded Ferguson from “neutral” to “overweight” with a £59.50 target price. A sell-off in response to Tuesday’s first-half results and cautious guidance from the builders’ merchant was overdone, it argued. The broker also predicted that speculation of share buybacks would be revived as Ferguson approaches its 2019 year-end. “New growth guidance is sensibly based and implies a much less alarming view on volumes in the core US markets than on first view. Furthermore, we expect margin trends to begin showing signs of improvement in the second half, reflecting actions [taken] in the first, reduced labour inflation and better margin mix. We are also . . . more positive on the scope for US residential data to improve over the next six months . . . These factors should start to drive a re-rating, meaning the recent disconnect versus the US home improvement players reverses.”JPMorgan ● Citigroup upgraded Pets at Home from “neutral” to “buy” with a 180p target price. A deep dive into the group’s retail and veterinary divisions suggested that management has a viable turnround plan, it said.    “Although execution risk remains, we believe Pets at Home offers attractive upside potential as the restructuring continues, with further upside in the longer term from free cash flow growth. This is supported by the strong dividend payout track record.”Citi Vets remain the material driver for Pets at Home’s earnings growth and a stringent review of each joint venture practice by Deloitte should help create a more sustainable, mature business, said Citi. It also concluded that retail profitability should be sustainable over the longer term given Pets at Home’s differentiated product offering and high market share in key categories such as nutrition and accessories. The group’s reliance on private-label products and its loyalty programme with 3.9m active customers should be high barriers for any competitors, the broker added. ● Jefferies downgraded Inditex, the Zara owner, from “buy” to “hold” with a €27 target price. Easing headwinds from emerging market currencies have failed to translate to improved profitability, raising concerns that the margin pressure may not be transitory, it said.  The broker said it had assumed Inditex was adjusting local price points to reflect rising buying costs in the 2017 autumn-winter season, with a follow-through benefit to margins at the 2018 full year. In reality, fourth-quarter results from the group missed consensus forecasts as both like-for-like sales and gross margins disappointed, said Jefferies. It advised clients to switch into Primark owner AB Foods. ● In brief: Aggreko rated new “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Barry Callebaut raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; ConvaTec rated new “neutral” at Redburn; Greencoat Renewables raised to “outperform” at RBC; Técnicas Reunidas raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Enagas cut to “sell” at Société Générale; Endesa downgraded to “underperform” at RBC; Gem Diamonds cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Bureau Veritas rated new “sector perform” at RBC; Porvair rated new “buy” at Stifel.

"Amazon’s puffa jacket success sends shivers through luxury sector","A Chinese-made coat selling for $139.99 has been the runaway hit of the winter","A puffa jacket selling for $139.99 on Amazon has a story to tell about the disruptive threats facing the luxury goods industry. The Orolay Thickened Women’s Down Jacket has been the viral consumer hit of the winter. It is Amazon’s number one bestseller in women’s down jackets and parkas. Equipped with many zips and pockets, and in a cocoon silhouette that nods to the designs of luxury brands Moncler or Balenciaga, it has become an internet sensation. It has its own hashtag and even its own Instagram account @theamazoncoat, assuring its place in the zeitgeist. Crucially, for the luxury goods industry it also encapsulates disruptive threats long feared by executives and owners of Europe’s luxury brands: Amazon’s ability to sell sought-after fashion, China’s capacity to make it, and a belief among luxury’s traditional clientele that it is chic to spend less.  #TheAmazonCoat started to be noticed by the fashion cognoscenti a year ago. New York Magazine noted its appearance on the backs of women in New York’s Upper East Side, the well-heeled Manhattan enclave that is a core market for sellers of luxury goods. “It’s like Moncler when it first came out,” said one of the Upper East Siders interviewed describing its must-have status, a comment that also must have chilled the heart of any luxury executive reading it. “Or the black puffy North Face in the ’90s when it first came out,” this person added. Of course, the Amazon coat is not like Moncler, most clearly on price. A Moncler Amethyst coat from the runway collection, which is sold out on its website, retails for €2,600. A North Face retro Nuptse jacket sells for €240. A year on and the coat, which is made by a Chinese company that also makes folding chairs, storage cabinets and bar stools, has been photographed on hundreds of consumers — from fashion influencers pairing it with Chanel handbags to children wearing it playing in the snow. It has more than 6,000 comments on Amazon. © Instagram More than half the reviewers give it five stars, but not all of them are positive. There are complaints about resilience to bad weather and the quality of the stitching. But its price, lightly fashionable look and warmth are hits. So too is its inclusive sizing — a hot topic for the fashion and luxury industry. It comes in sizes from XXS to XXL.  One-off crazes are a fashion world staple. Teddy Bear coats for next winter have flocked the runways this fashion month and are already populating Instagram. Teen Vogue has compared the Amazon coat’s success to craze for J Crew gingham a few years ago. But the #TheAmazonCoat mania has a crucial distinction from past fashion sensations. It reveals consumer appetite to consider the world’s biggest retailer a destination for buying hot fashion. Amazon becoming a purveyor of high fashion is the stuff of nightmares for luxury executives. Johann Rupert, boss of Cartier-owner Richemont four years ago, warned about the threat luxury groups face if tech giants decided to sell luxury. So far Amazon has stayed out. Still, Carrie Barber, managing director and head of luxury goods, apparel and beauty at Credit Suisse, told a Financial Times conference last year that she believes when Amazon “choose to make luxury a priority then they will decide to do something meaningful”. © Instagram The Amazon coat also highlights the fashion opportunity for Made in China. McKinsey argued in a recent report that traditional luxury goods companies’ supply chains were ill equipped to cope with sudden surges in online demand and therefore missed opportunities. Part of the Amazon coat’s success has been its Chinese manufacturer’s super fast production response. It offered the coat rapidly in more colours and sizes as demand surged. The more subtle moral of the Amazon coat tale is one luxury executives fear so much they rarely dare to speak its name: that big global concerns over the economy, climate change and sustainability may radically alter people’s appetite for buying very expensive things. One veteran industry executive in Milan said his greatest concern was that traditional luxury consumers would start to find it more chic to spend less and consume less. The growing market for renting posh frocks — and bragging about it on Instagram — or buying only second-hand expensive handbags like those from Chanel or Louis Vuitton is seen as a sign of this shift in consumer sentiment. So too is the Amazon coat sensation. In other words: in the future you may proudly rent your Versace dress, while you proudly own #TheAmazonCoat.","20.02.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Unilever, Air France, M&S, Metro, Capita, Moncler","Shell’s dividend costs hobble its M&A potential, says RBC","Wednesday 15:00 GMT What’s happening ● Beiersdorf of Germany led European consumer goods makers lower after the Nivea producer reset margin targets to reflect a multiyear investment programme aimed at reviving growth. Stefan De Loecker, the group’s new chief executive, announced plans to spend an additional €70m-€80m annually on its consumer business, meaning divisional margins this year would be 14-14.5 per cent rather than the 15.9 per cent expected by the consensus. Analysts saw a 10 per cent cut to Beiersdorf’s 2019 earnings as a result. “This margin reset comes after many similar events in the industry over the past few months, and marks a necessary pivot towards a more traditional growth agenda after years of what had been seen as too extreme a cost-cutting. That said, this may thus put pressure via negative read across on the very few names [that have] stuck to their margin targets or high profitability levels.”Citigroup Beirsdorf joins Henkel and Colgate-Palmolive as having all cut margin targets to fund investment. “This is bound to up the ante for Unilever, who compete with all three of the resetters in big categories like skincare, haircare, dentifrice and laundry,” said Jefferies. “We therefore expect the credibility of Unilever’s 2020 margin target to be the subject of even greater debate.” ● Air France-KLM slid on news that the Dutch government had taken a 12.7 per cent stake in the airline and intended to increase it to 14 per cent, equal to the stake of the French government. Wopke Hoekstra, the Netherlands’ finance minister, said the move was a “fundamental step toward protecting Dutch interests”, adding that “several times in recent years the Dutch interest was not given enough weight in important decisions for the company as a whole”. “The hiring of a non-French chief executive to head the group was a clear positive in representing a commitment from France to allow the group to be run on a commercial basis to try to achieve industry-standard profitability at Air France in particular . . . However, the will of the Netherlands to play a bigger role in strategic decision-making raises the risk of political interference in the running of the group.”Credit Suisse Separately, Morgan Stanley downgraded Air France-KLM to “equal weight” on valuation grounds. ● Marks and Spencer plunged on a surprise dividend cut. The retailer said it would reduce its final payout from 11.9p to 7.1p while announcing a £600m rights issue to fund its purchase of half of Ocado’s UK food deliveries business.  Jefferies downgraded M&S from “buy” to “hold”. Not only was the Ocado deal a “very expensive way for M&S to defend food volumes”, the dividend cut and funding structure raised broader concerns about earnings visibility, ambitious synergy targets and return on investment, it said. “Ocado UK has grown sales by circa £1bn in the past decade (at reducing [operating] margins). It remains a great customer offering, but with very skewed demographics. We don’t see the replacement of Waitrose with M&S as changing that brand appeal. And as a result we don’t feel bullish about the potential for M&S to supercharge its food growth via the joint venture.”Jefferies ● Capita was the FTSE 250’s biggest gainer amid market rumours of a disposal. Analysts have speculated that the outsourcer remained open to selling parts of its Specialist Services division, which provides about a quarter of group revenue. ● Metro Bank hit a record low after setting out plans to slow growth and raise £350m via a rights issue. With full-year results that were no worse than flagged in a January profit warning, Metro scrapped its 2020 profitability target, reduced guidance for returns by 2023 and tempered medium-term ambitions for deposit growth and branch expansion. The lender also warned that it did not expect to get regulatory approval before 2021 to use its own estimates for credit risk, two years later than planned.  “The visibility of Metro Bank’s investment case is further reduced. And with the medium-term targets being five years out, we remain uncertain over the level of equity required to achieve these targets. The slower growth and higher than expected equity raise (£350m versus £200m in our estimates) implies that our returns will be further diluted.”Panmure Gordon Sellside stories ● HSBC downgraded Moncler and Prada to “hold” from “buy” as part of a European luxury goods sector review. Its overall thesis was for multi-brand, diversified groups such as LVMH, Richemont and Kering to outperform while single-brand companies faced growing pressure.  The likes of Moncler and Prada were risky investments “as fashion, by its essence, comes and goes. In that context, diversity offers a natural hedge,” it said. “The only exceptions we see to that rule are Hermès, for which in some categories demand exceeds supply and Chanel, for which there is a perception of timelessness.” Prada would find it “harder to sustain strong top-line growth at a time when Louis Vuitton and Gucci are dominating the space”, HSBC added.  On Moncler, the broker applauded its “best-in-class execution, creative projects and store expansion, driven by a solid bench of managers”. But a valuation of 24.5 times 2019 earnings was high enough given challenging year-on-year comparisons in the first half. ● RBC downgraded Royal Dutch Shell to “sector perform” and advised a switch into Total, which was raised to “outperform” with a €60 target price. The broker argued that Shell’s reserve life was shorter than peers and dividend costs hobbled its ability to build out the portfolio with acquisitions.  “With ongoing uncertainty in the macro landscape and energy transition, we see Shell’s dividend as too much of a burden over the medium term, meaning Shell’s buyback is out of necessity, not choice . . . At today’s share price we think Shell needs at least another $30bn in buybacks in order to reduce its dividend burden to a sustainable level. We think the need to complete a buyback out to 2025 could limit its options to high-grade its portfolio over time.”RBC Total, by contrast, has one of the most diverse portfolios of growth projects in the sector, as well as the strongest free cash flow generation, yet trades at a lower valuation than most of its peers, RBC added.  ● In brief: Auto Trader rated new “sell” at Stifel; Bluefield Solar raised to “buy” at Investec; EssilorLuxottica cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Freenet upgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; Icade downgraded to “underweight” at Barclays; Meggitt cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Munich Re cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Smurfit Kappa downgraded to “hold” at Goodbody; Technogym rated new “buy” at Citigroup; Tullow downgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; Unicaja Banco rated new “buy” at Berenberg.

"Potential criminal sanctions sharpen fintechs’ Brexit focus","Your essential weekly fintech briefing","Michael Kent, CEO of international money-transfer start-up Azimo, never considered that Brexit could make him an unwitting criminal. At least that was the case until two weeks ago, when he received a “Dear CEO” letter from the Irish central bank setting out the implications for any firm that continues to operate in the Irish market without local authorisations in the event of a hard or no-deal Brexit. “It is a criminal offence for an unauthorised firm” to continue to provide services in Ireland, the letter informed Mr Kent and the hundreds of other CEOs who received it, many of them smaller fintechs. “That was the first time I’d been threatened with criminal sanction by anyone, ever,” said Mr Kent, who is based in London and is also a co-founder of UK digital-bank Tandem. “A lot of people have been sticking their heads in the sand. That letter definitely focused the mind.” With the UK set to blow past the March 29 Brexit deadline with no deal in sight, London’s fintech community has become increasingly exasperated with politicians' dithering and the resultant difficulties companies face trying to plan for the future.  “If I was starting another fintech today, I would have to think very long and hard as to whether London was the best place to do it,” said Mr Kent, a Briton by nationality. “I suspect I would conclude not. I am hard-pushed to see a single positive thing in Brexit.” The UK established itself as Europe’s fintech capital by leveraging its deep capital market, diverse workforce, supportive regulator, trusted legal system and a series of tax breaks and credits (not to mention its pubs, restaurants, culture, language, transport — basically everything but the weather). But, with the country increasingly likely to be cast adrift and lose its “passport” to provide financial services across the EU when it leaves, those advantages may not be enough to save it. Valued at more than £100m and handling currency transactions of more than $1bn annually, Azimo would have the resources to set up an EU hub in Amsterdam and seek a Dutch banking licence, while retaining its London headquarters. Many smaller fintechs have been gambling on some kind of deal, transition period or regulatory forbearance so they can continue operating out of the UK.  Sylvia Carrasco, founder and chief executive of peer-to-peer gold trading company Goldex, which has raised more than £2m, said she has been most disappointed by the lack of communication from the British government and regulators over Brexit. “I am Spanish, I have been here 26 years, but I am still in limbo,” said the former Credit Suisse and UBS trader who also founded FCA-regulated brokerage Alion Partners Capital. “It’s now the end of March and I still don’t know how or if my companies will be able to serve European customers.” “[There is] a tremendous lack of information. What happens if there is no deal?” she said. “Chaos, sure, but tell me what chaos; how will it affect me? It is obviously a nightmare.” Goldex set up a subsidiary in Ms Carrasco’s native country as an insurance policy, but it came at a cost. Excluding salaries of employees engaged in Brexit-related work, the company has spent £100,000 on Brexit planning in the past 18 months, money that could otherwise have been spent employing young graduates in London. Both Mr Kent and Ms Carrasco are most worried about the often farcical negotiations damaging the reputation of the UK as a place to do business and causing an exodus of talent, echoing the CEOs of billion-pound fintech unicorns Monzo and Revolut. The founder of the latter, Nik Storonsky, recently called for specialised fintech British visas, but no plans are forthcoming. “Brexit has put young, mobile tech talent off the UK as a place to build a career. I hear it every day,” Mr Kent said. “Coupled with very high prices for everything in London, now Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin or Lisbon look more attractive. They are the future clusters.” Despite all that, UK fintech investment from the likes of private equity and venture capital jumped 56 per cent to $3.9bn last year, more than half the total invested in the region and four-and-a-half times more than second-placed Germany ($845m), according to data from Accenture and CB Insights. “It’s vital that London continues to foster an environment that encourages competition in the banking industry, irrespective of uncertainty” surrounding Brexit, said Richard Lumb, Accenture’s head of financial services. Some damage has already been done. “I have not been impressed by our political class,” Azimo’s Mr Kent says. “I travel all over the world — it is embarrassing to be British at the moment.” One to watch: Tiger Brokers Beijing-based online brokerage Tiger Brokers, which enjoys the patronage of famed emerging markets investor Jim Rogers, has become the latest Chinese fintech to set its sights on an American listing, writes Don Weinland in Beijing. Tiger, also known as Up Fintech, announced plans last week to raise $91m in a sale of American depositary shares, which could come later this week. The company’s main product is a sleek app that offers a channel for so-called “global Chinese investors” to buy US securities. Tiger captured nearly 60 per cent of the volume flowing through that market in 2017, or about $49.5bn, according to independent research cited in its prospectus.  With the backing of Mr Rogers, New York-based Interactive Brokers and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, Tiger will join a handful of Chinese fintech groups that came to the market over the past year. Several of those companies, such as Ppdai and Qudian, were part of China’s overheating peer-to-peer lending industry, a corner of the fintech world where companies match up lenders and borrowers on online platforms. New regulation in China has made P2P a risky scene and those IPOs have performed poorly. China’s online brokerages could become a better bet on the country’s fintech offering as competition in the sector heats up. Tencent-backed Futu Holdings, another Chinese online brokerage, raised $90m in a US IPO at the start of the month, at a valuation of about $1.7bn. During the recent rise of China’s stock market, another e-broker, East Money Information, became bigger than US-based E*Trade by market capitalisation. Yet, a note of caution for anyone looking to get in on the boom by investing in Tiger: Some analysts have flagged its reliance on backers for key operations and clearing trades. “While Tiger has grown at a stupendous pace over the past three years, it has been able to do so owing to [Interactive Brokers] doing most of the heavy lifting of execution and clearing,” said Sumeet Singh, an analyst at Aequitas Research, writing for Smartkarma. “While it’s trying to change that now, nearly all the revenue is still being driven by its [Interactive Brokers] affiliation.” Number of the week: $43bn  Combined value of Worldpay and FIS if their proposed merger comes off

 Further fintech fascination Regulators’ advance: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is having another crack at crypto. The influential global standard-setter for financial services decreed last week that cryptoassets such as bitcoin pose potential risks to financial stability. The warning comes just a few months after the Financial Stability Board, a close relative of the Basel Committee, said “cryptoassets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time”. Meanwhile, at the weekend, the People's Bank of China pledged to gradually set up a system of rules to regulate fintech.  Stumbling blocks: Things have only gotten worse for German fintech Wirecard since the Financial Times published reports on suspected accounting irregularities at the company. Last week Wirecard’s Singapore office said it has lost touch with Edo Kurniawan, who led the group’s accounting in the Asia-Pacific region since February 9. Mr Kurniawan played an alleged central role in the affair. Follow the money: Mexico City hasn’t always been known as a fintech hub. But Wall Street banks have recently taken notice of the market, where many people are underserved by traditional financial institutions. One alternative lender based in the city, Credijusto, just opened a line of credit of up to $100m with Goldman Sachs. The company is backed by former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack. AOB: Robo advisers are looking increasingly attractive for the 18–34-year-old demographic, only 6 per cent of which, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, took financial advice in 2017. ** Fintech Stash has introduced a reward programme with a difference for its Stash debit card — customers can now earn stock in the companies they buy from (or in an ETF if their vendor of choice isn't listed) ** ","18.03.2019"

Still, big as Donald Trump and Xi Jinping’s stand-off is, it is the elections in Europe that take centre stage. European elections On Thursday Europe begins elections for a new European Parliament. The vote will run until Sunday and, with 400m people eligible to take part, it is the world’s largest exercise in transnational democracy.  Both the main centre-right and centre-left blocs are expected to lose ground, with rightwing Eurosceptic parties as well as pro-EU reformists and greens set to make gains. Britain will also be electing MEPs after the UK government’s failure to deliver Brexit on March 29.  The feeling among commentators in Brussels is that it will take a coalition of three or four different political groups to form a majority in the EU parliament, which will be key to appointing the next European Commission president. The election begins a period that could last weeks or months of putting in place the new leadership of the commission and other EU institutions.

  India results  The first hint as to who has the advantage in India’s mammoth seven-stage general election will come after the polls close on Sunday and media outlets can finally report on exit polls after nearly six weeks of voting. But Indians must wait until Thursday for the official count. First projections last week pointed to prime minister Narendra Modi’s ruling coalition falling short of a majority, raising hopes within the main opposition Congress party that it will be able to cobble together a coalition and return to power. ● Modi faces unlikely challenge as Indian polling draws to an end
 On Wednesday Indonesia is due to confirm unofficial polls showing that incumbent Joko Widodo beat ex-general Prabowo Subianto in last month’s presidential election. Geopolitics President Donald Trump will travel to Japan on Saturday for a three-day visit. North Korea and trade are expected to be high on the agenda when the US president meets Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe. Mr Trump is also scheduled to meet Japan’s new Emperor Naruhito, who ascended to the throne earlier this month after the abdication of his father Akihito. Central banks The South African Reserve Bank meets on Thursday. Its policy rate was unanimously left unchanged at 6.75 per cent at its March meeting and no change is again expected.  Nigeria, Israel and Egypt announce rate decisions this week, again with no changes likely.  Investors will look for clarity on how transitory the Federal Open Market Committee believes recent weakness in economic activity and inflation to be when the central bank on Wednesday releases minutes of its May meeting. Committee members voted to hold rates steady, as expected, in response to muted inflation and economic uncertainty. The Fed has adopted a wait-and-see approach to interest rates, and some officials have suggested they could lower rates if inflation growth does not pick up. Fed chair Jay Powell said during a news conference after the meeting he did not see a strong case to move rates in either direction. The minutes of the ECB’s April meeting are also out on Wednesday. Earnings Ahead of the latest round of first-quarter US corporate earnings, the consensus among analysts was that profits would shrink. However, with about 90 per cent of listed companies having reported, the results instead reveal modest growth in net income of 0.2 per cent, according to Credit Suisse data.  The increase seems small but it is significant: it means US companies have managed to boost earnings without the aid of last year’s corporate tax cuts, which boosted the profitability of US groups by about 23 per cent. However, there are fears growth in US earnings has peaked. Markets Questions has more on this. Retailers are at the forefront in the US this week. Big-box chain Target, electronics retailer Best Buy and home-improvement stores Home Depot and Lowe’s are due to report quarterly financial results. JC Penney, Nordstrom, Ross, Kohl’s and TJX will also have earnings updates. Outside of the retail world, there will be earnings reports from HP, Toll Brothers, Ryanair and Tata Motors. In the UK high street bellwether Marks and Spencer will be the hot topic on Wednesday when it reports full-year earnings. M&S is expected to post a renewed decline in clothing and homeware sales in its latest quarter, damping the relief felt for the previous three months when it reported a first increase in nearly two years. The retailer is also forecast to report a 14 per cent fall in profit for its 2016-17 financial year, reflecting lower sales and higher employment costs. It is, however, expected to maintain its dividend payment. Royal Mail is expected to report significantly lower annual profits on Wednesday as letter volumes continue to decline. The postal service has been reviewing its operations and testing new methods including automation for deliveries. Soft-drinks maker Britvic, food-ingredient maker Tate & Lyle, power operator SSE, children’s goods retailer Mothercare and water groups Severn Trent and United Utilities also report this week. Metro Bank faces a potential investor backlash at its annual meeting in London, with some shareholders opposed to the re-election of key directors over an accounting error that forced it to raise £375m in a discounted share placement to shore up its balance sheet. ● Metro Bank’s woes are a warning: watch the metrics

 Economic data Japan’s first-quarter GDP data are out on Monday and analysts predict growth to be near the zero mark. Some expect a slight fall into negative territory while others, citing strong domestic demand and an unemployment rate of just 2.5 per cent, forecast a dip into recession will be narrowly avoided.  The reading takes extra significance because Japan holds elections for its upper house in July, while a decision must soon be made on whether to raise consumption tax.  Inflation data out on Friday are likely to show Tokyo’s inflation goal of 2 per cent is a long way off. Gavyn Davies: Shinzo Abe contemplates one last throw of the economic dice

Japan’s economy is ‘worsening’ for first time in 6 years

 Analysts will on Thursday parse the more detailed release of German GDP figures after the first reading of the world’s fourth-largest economy earlier this month showed a better than expected rebound to 0.4 per cent.  France, Germany and the wider eurozone all have purchasing managers’ indices out this week. In the US there will be fresh data on durable goods orders and sales of both new and existing homes. ING economists have cautioned that durable goods data will be negatively affected by a sharp drop in Boeing aircraft orders. UK inflation unexpectedly remained stable during March when consumer prices were 1.9 per cent higher than a year ago, the same as in February. City of London economists had expected an increase to 2 per cent. This time the forecasts are that inflation will rise above the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target. The UK’s retail sales on Friday could once again be volatile, with the sunny Easter weekend likely to play a part. March’s year-on-year figures were more upbeat but were felt to be flattered somewhat by fearful consumers stocking up ahead of Brexit and comparison with 2018’s Beast from the East storm.

"Lyft shares close almost 9% higher on market debut","Ride-hailing company lists in the largest US technology debut since Snap in 2017","US ride-hailing company Lyft accelerated into the public markets on Friday, with its shares opening up more than 20 per cent before pulling back on those gains to close 8.7 per cent above the initial public offering price. The shares traded in a $78.02-$88.60 band during the day before ending the session at $78.29, for a market capitalisation of $22.4bn.
 Lyft’s IPO raised $2.3bn on Thursday at an issue price of $72 a share, valuing the company at $24bn on a fully diluted basis, including restricted shares and options allocated to employees. A total of 6.1m shares changed hands at $87.24 a share when the stock began trading on the Nasdaq at 11:48am in New York. It was the largest US technology IPO since Snap in 2017, boosting hopes for a wave of listings by the most highly valued private companies in Silicon Valley, including Pinterest, Slack, Airbnb, and the biggest so-called unicorn of all, Uber. “The reservoir of private companies has built up enough,” said Paul Hudson of Glade Brook Capital Partners, an investment group with stakes in both Lyft and Uber. “We’re at a very interesting nexus where these fish are going to start swimming finally from the private market to the public market . . . There’s only so much Google and Facebook you can own.” John Healy, an equity analyst at Northcoast Research, said the pullback from the morning’s trading highs reflected “the supply and demand dynamics of the offering” rather than Lyft’s underlying business. “It was a week ago we were talking about this stock pricing at $65 and it’s ended today at $80 — that’s impressive.” We believed in the character and the culture of the [Lyft] founders, in a way we didn't in UberBen Horowitz, Lyft board member and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz Lyft beat its arch-rival to market, but Uber is close behind. Its larger competitor is preparing to unveil its own IPO as soon as next month, according to people familiar with the matter. Investors and bankers say it could be valued at more than $100bn in what would be one of the biggest public offerings in US corporate history. Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer — whose combined stakes were valued at more than $1bn based on the issue price — said the decision to take the company public had been driven by the company’s internal readiness, not Wall Street enthusiasm. “We thought the moment to do it was when we could go public without changing the day-to-day way we ran the company,” Mr Zimmer, Lyft’s president, told the Financial Times in an interview. “It happened to be that this is a good moment in the market to do so.” Under a dual-class share structure, Mr Zimmer and Mr Green will control almost 50 per cent of votes, despite owning less than 5 per cent of the company. Mr Zimmer said investors’ response to the listing was a validation for Lyft’s long-term goal of replacing private cars with a shared and, eventually autonomous, fleet. “Investors were excited to be part of this story because they saw there is a massive shift coming from owned vehicles to transportation as a service,” he said. “We’ve seen this play out in entertainment with Netflix and Spotify. They agree with us that there’s never been a market this large make that shift.” Investors flocked to Lyft despite its steep losses since it was founded in 2012 as a spin-off of Mr Green and Mr Zimmer’s first venture, a Facebook app for long-distance carpooling. Lyft's listing is marked in Times Square, New York © Reuters In its marketing roadshow over the past two weeks, the company pitched its rapid growth in revenue and market share, as well as the expansion of the overall ride-hailing market, as a can’t-miss investment opportunity. Lyft and Uber have battled each other in the US from their earliest days, driving up losses. But Lyft took advantage when Uber was rocked by a series of scandals in 2017, boosting its market share to about 30 per cent now, according to research group Second Measure. It still spends heavily, however, with losses rising 32 per cent to $911m last year as revenue doubled to $2.16bn. “Lyft is underestimated in terms of how quickly I think it will go profitable,” said Ben Horowitz, a Lyft board member and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, one of Lyft’s earliest and largest investors. Mr Horowitz said he had backed Lyft rather than Uber in 2013 “because we believed in the character and the culture of the founders, in a way we didn’t in Uber”. Daniel Ives, Wedbush Securities analyst, said Lyft was “a prove-me stock over the coming quarters to see what could happen on market share, ridership and profitability per ride”. Lyft sold 32.5m shares at $72 each, the top end of its targeted range. The offering was “meaningfully oversubscribed”, according to two people familiar with the matter, leading the company to increase both its price range and number of shares on sale.  Some would-be buyers who did not get allocated all the shares they had hoped for on Thursday bought on Friday, generating strong activity, one of the people said.

			 Lyft kicked off its first day as a public company on Friday at a former car dealership in Los Angeles, where its co-founders rang the bell to open trading on the Nasdaq more than 2,000 miles away. Los Angeles is the ride-hailing app’s largest metropolitan market and the hometown of chief executive Mr Green. He said the city’s notorious traffic had convinced him car ownership was a “failing model” and inspired his interest in rethinking transportation.  The founders were joined by Lyft board members and staff, as well as Nasdaq president Nelson Griggs, at a former Toyota dealership that Lyft is converting into a driver centre where it will offer repairs and other services. The company also invited some longtime drivers and passengers to the event. Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles mayor, was also on hand as Lyft announced it would invest at least $50m a year in transportation initiatives in cities where it operates, starting with LA.  “Some good came out of Los Angeles traffic,” Mr Garcetti said.

"Europe should be wary of the lure of bigger banks","As long as continent-wide deposit insurance remains out of reach, mergers will be risky","Compared with the US banks, Europe’s appear small © AFP In many ways it was hardly a surprise that the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber, said recently when commenting on European banks that “what Europe needs in order to catch up with American firms is European champions, banks that are larger in size”. Last year was a bad one for European bank shares, capping a torrid decade after which, for most large banks, profits and share prices are still well below pre-crisis levels. The industry is grappling with the twin challenges of a sluggish revenue outlook coupled with rising IT spending. And compared with the US banks, Europe’s appear small: JPMorgan’s market capitalisation today exceeds the combined value of BNP Paribas, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, BBVA, Santander, Credit Suisse, UBS and Deutsche Bank. It is hardly a surprise that investment bankers are dusting down their pitch books and that, in bank boardrooms at least, mergers and acquisitions are back on the agenda. And in some cases those bankers may be enjoying a receptive audience.  Supplying kindling to the gathering flame, the regulator for banks in the eurozone — the European Central Bank — appears to be positively encouraging combinations. Danièle Nouy, the just-retired chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board, has gone on record saying that the “European banking union sets the scene for banks to merge across borders”. And in the perennial joust between managements, who typically want to do deals, and shareholders, who tend to be sceptical, having the referee on your side clearly makes the desired result more likely. But is it safe to have larger banks? Consider perhaps the most important lesson of the financial crisis from Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England: “Global banks are international in life, but national in death.” Put in practical terms, the 2008 rescue of the globally active Icelandic banks fell mainly on the narrow shoulders of Icelandic taxpayers. Crucially, this lesson is as relevant today as it was then.  But doesn’t the “banking union” Ms Nouy cited spread the burden of rescuing banks across all Europe’s taxpayers, not just a single country? Unfortunately not, since a Europe-wide deposit guarantee scheme — arguably the most important part of that union — remains out of reach.  Today, as in 2008, it will be down to taxpayers in the home country to rescue their own banks, something the chair of the eurozone’s Single Resolution Board, Elke König, admitted in a recent Financial Times interview. But surely, at least, banks have shrunk enough today such that they are no longer too big to fail? Again, no. For example, Unicredit’s balance sheet today is still half the size of Italian gross domestic product. And if the periodically mooted combination with France’s Société Générale were ever to happen, the resulting group’s balance sheet would be bigger than the GDP of Italy and similar to that of France — leaving Italian or French taxpayers squarely on the hook. Finally, don’t new rules today mean that the cost of rescuing a bank falls on providers of bank capital and debt, not taxpayers? To an extent, yes; new rules provide some protection. But, in practice, it is clear that a large bank facing imminent collapse would not simply be allowed to fail once other providers of capital were fully wiped out. In the real world, taxpayers would again be required to step in, especially if failure to do so risked a systemic crisis. That is what happened in 2017 with the rescue of some small Italian banks. In reality we are a long way from ending “too big to fail”. For European banks, getting bigger may feel like an attractive escape route after a painful decade. Unfortunately, it is rarely the right response for shareholders. But it would also be a worrying development for Europe’s citizens who still have to deal with the consequences of banks that become too big to bail.

"JPMorgan, Goldman and Citi are stealing a march on overseas rivals as dealmaking surges in the US","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One DD scoop to start: leisure group Merlin Entertainments, best known for Legoland Resorts and Madame Tussauds wax museums, is set to be acquired in a £6bn deal by the Danish billionaire family that controls the toymaker Lego, private equity group Blackstone and a Canadian pension fund. More here.
 Donald Trump thinks of himself as the ultimate dealmaker. As we all know, he’s even got a book on it — The Art of the Deal. In it, Trump encourages thinking big (full disclosure: DD has no plans to ever read the ghostwritten book). US dealmakers have taken that to heart.  Intended or not, Trump’s “America First” policies have had an impact on global dealmaking. US activity is soaring, while Asia and Europe have been enviously watching from the sidelines.   Buoyant stock markets and cheap financing in the debt markets have helped to crank the volume of deals up almost a fifth from a year ago, and America’s slice of the takeover pie is bigger than it has been in more than three decades.  America’s merger success has come at the expense of cross-border deals, as Trump’s protectionist approach — including his trade war with China — keeps dealmakers thinking local.  Companies have found plenty of suitors on home turf, with 10 of the largest transactions sealed between companies located within the same country. The US accounted for eight of them.  While bankers in the US have been kept busy with mega deals from the likes of drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb, defence contractor United Technologies and oil group Occidental Petroleum, European bankers have looked on green eyed.  The trend has lined the pockets of American investment banks, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all gaining market share over Asian and European rivals, according to Refinitiv data. Here’s how they all rank:   Regulators in Europe have taken a hard stance on antitrust issues, dashing the hopes of companies such as Siemens.  And if it’s not the regulators putting barriers up, the companies themselves are having a hard time seeing eye to eye. For Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank it was too complicated and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles got tired of delays at France’s Renault.   A single $69bn deal engineered by Saudi Arabia to bolster the prospects of its state oil company Saudi Aramco was chiefly responsible for a pick-up in activity in Africa and the Middle East, proving the impact that large deals can have.   Here are the main takeaways in terms of data: $1.1tn worth of US corporate takeovers were agreed in the first half of the year; 

global dealmaking reached $2tn in total, which is the third-highest on record but still down 13 per cent from last year; 

European transactions tumbled 57 per cent to $287bn, marking the weakest first half in six years;

activity in Japan also dropped, by 23 per cent to $38bn. The value of deals in the rest of Asia Pacific came in at $342bn, down 28 per cent from last year. 

 Get the full story from the DD team here.  Japanese governance gets a makeover  Japan’s governance shortcomings have been a constant source of consternation for investors.  © FT monatge / Bloomberg Take the highly acrimonious battle between the hedge fund Oasis Management and Alpine Electronics over its merger with Alps Electric, its parent company and Apple supplier.  Minority investors, including the Hong Kong-based firm, took issue with the price, which they thought was artificially low. When the deal was announced, Alpine investors said the tie-up stank of a distinctly Japanese odour of stitch-up and claim that the company would be worth about twice that. The firm, ran by the activist fund Seth Fischer, said the deal was a clear example of the failure of Japanese managements to defend the interests of minority shareholders.  Japan’s governance issues are so profound — even high-profile companies such as Sony, Toshiba and Olympus have struggled to avoid them — that it prompted some people to ask, what else did you expect?  Even Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund run by Paul Singer, took a stake, emboldened by a government campaign urging Japanese businesses to engage with outside shareholders and deliver higher returns.  Now Japan is on the cusp of change. The country will unveil its first changes to its M&A guidelines in more than a decade on Friday as the government prepares for a spree of management buyouts and companies taking over listed subsidiaries.  The new guidelines reflect an acknowledgment by the government that current rules don’t sufficiently protect against conflicts of interest and too easily allow the steamrollering of minority shareholders.  The changes come as Japanese companies braced for what could potentially be the most contentious shareholder meeting season in history. Acutely aware of the high-profile activist pressures, some Japanese corporations are already making attempts to forestall trouble at their annual meetings by pledging to scrap their takeover defence strategies to placate investors.  But before activists get out the bubbly, it’s important to remember that the guidelines, which are intended to reduce the conflict of interest that arises from companies having cross-shareholdings and the overly cosy relationship between management and banks, are non-binding.  Still, it’s a show of Japan’s wider push for better governance standards that have left many investors in the region with a sour taste and could revive Japan’s underperforming equity market. The FT’s Leo Lewis has the full story here.  Hays takes Broadway to the courtroom Depositions are typically unpleasant affairs for those facing inquiry. But Carole Shorenstein Hays, Tony award-winning Broadway producer, was not going to let some probing questions crimp her style. And that has become a problem for the Tony law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell.  Hays’s company was involved in a complex Delaware law dispute with a business partner over the rights to featuring the shows Dear Evan Hansen and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in San Francisco. In a deposition she gave over 10 hours, Hays’s evasive and bizarre answers led to a rebuke from the Delaware Supreme Court in a 20-page addendum to the decision for the underlying dispute.  The court wrote about “Hays’s wilful and bad faith litigation tactics”: “The deposition appears to have been a colossal waste of time and resources due to her behaviour, which made a mockery of the entire deposition proceeding.” We’ve copied excerpts of her deposition answers below but please click the link and go to page 51 for the entire spectacle. Trust us, it’s worth your time.  The court also took issue with the law firm which the court believed should’ve done more to curtail its client’s courtroom antics.

"Stocks to watch: BAT, Burberry, Aon, easyJet, L&G, John Laing","Tobacco stocks stand to benefit from exit of FDA commissioner, say analysts","Wednesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands gained in response to news that Scott Gottlieb, the US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, would be retiring after nearly two years in the role. During Dr Gottlieb’s tenure, he pushed for anti-smoking measures including a ban on menthol cigarettes and cutting nicotine to non-addictive levels. “With Gottlieb being the driving force behind these initiatives, there is a possibility the timing around any action could be pushed out, and therefore it should be a net positive for big tobacco sentiment. In the case of a menthol ban, with near-term actions already unlikely . . ., without Gottlieb pushing this forward then we think near-term risk around this is reduced significantly.”Jefferies Dr Gottlieb’s exit may also be a positive for the ecigarette market, analysts said. The FDA said in November that vape flavours likely to appeal to children should be removed from retail stores but, while market leader Juul complied immediately, BAT and Imperial have been awaiting further guidance. Any delay resulting from Dr Gottlieb’s retirement “could prove to be advantageous to both BAT and Imperial with regards to potentially claiming market share back from Juul”, said Jefferies. ● Legal & General was the FTSE 100’s sharpest faller after a poor cash performance from the insurer revived fears of a dividend cut.  L&G’s full-year results showed a surprise weakening in solvency, the ratio by which its assets cover liabilities. The new business strain of a record £10bn of annuity sales in 2018 meant L&G’s solvency ratio at the year end was 188 per cent, down 5 percentage points since the half year. Analysts also highlighted margin pressure at L&G Retirement, which caused a lower new-business surplus and meant the net release of cash from its ongoing business was just £760m rather than the £877m consensus expectation. Changes to its mortality assumptions meant L&G’s headline operating earnings matched forecasts in spite of the shortfall. ● Aon rallied after the insurer scrapped plans to merge with Irish peer Willis Towers Watson, less than a day after it was forced into a statement confirming that it was interested in an all-stock combination. Shareholders had been worried about dilution from the deal. “The question still remains as to whether WTW could have other potential suitors, although we believe the probability is low,” said Barclays. “It also raises the possibility of Aon pursuing another large acquisition, whether in insurance brokerage or elsewhere”, added the broker, which name-checked Arthur J Gallagher and Brown & Brown as the largest publicly traded insurance brokers.
 Sellside stories ● Lufthansa
 is likely to be “very interested” in acquiring easyJet
, said Kepler Cheuvreux.  “We would not be surprised if Lufthansa were to make an offer for easyJet over the coming months, particularly in the event that easyJet were to come under further pressure due to Brexit,” said Kepler. It argued that the German airline’s Eurowings no-frills fleet had similar profit targets to easyJet’s and saw consolidation as a panacea in Berlin, where both budget carriers were likely to be lossmaking.  “While easyJet’s service massively overlaps with IAG and Air France-KLM, we believe Lufthansa’s and easyJet’s joint businesses would imply manageable hurdles with the EU competition authorities. We estimate that the integration of easyJet into Lufthansa’s network could generate synergies worth circa €300m a year in the short term, as well as additional benefits in terms of easyJet feeding transfer traffic to Lufthansa’s aeroplanes.”Kepler ● Goldman Sachs downgraded Burberry to “sell” from “neutral” with an £18.55 price target. “We like the long-term equity story at Burberry but expect activity to re-invigorate sales momentum will encourage higher incremental investment near term,” it said. “With new product now entering stores, we see this as the time for Burberry to focus on capturing share in a competitive market.” While Burberry has the potential to deliver 5 per cent retail revenue growth next year, brand acceleration in the luxury goods sector typically comes with higher spending on sales and marketing, said Goldman. It forecast Burberry’s operating costs before licensing to increase 7 per cent in 2020 and 2021. At 24 times 2020 earnings, Burberry’s valuation “looks relatively demanding” versus a peer group that delivers 9 per cent annual earnings growth and is on 22 times earnings, Goldman said. The broker’s price target allowed for a 30 per cent likelihood that Burberry would be bid for, given its status as “a rare monobrand in the luxury industry”. ● HSBC downgraded John Laing to “hold” from “buy”, largely on valuation grounds.  The construction group’s prospects remain strong, with growth “underpinned by the structural rise in demand for infrastructure provision and renewable energy production”, said HSBC. However, a 30 per cent rally since mid-December had pushed John Laing into uncharted territory, it said: since flotation the shares have tended towards a 10 per cent discount to net asset value but are now trading at a 20 per cent premium. ● In brief: AB Foods upgraded to “buy” at Redburn; Beter Bed cut to “reduce” at Kepler Cheuvreux; DNO downgraded to “sector perform” at RBC; Evonik cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Genel cut to “sector perform” at RBC; Intertek downgraded to “underweight” at Barclays; Prysmian cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Raiffeisen downgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Synthomer raised to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Tullow upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays.

"FirstFT: Today’s top stories ","Your daily briefing on the news","FT subscribers can click here to receive FirstFT every day by email. Facebook has unveiled radical plans to launch a new global digital currency — called Libra — with 28 partners, including Visa, Mastercard, Uber, Vodafone and Spotify, in a move that could catapult nascent blockchain technology into the mainstream and upend the financial services industry. Facebook’s move is the most significant effort yet to bring blockchain technology, which does not rely on a central authority to issue money, into the mainstream and comes after the launch of hundreds of digital currencies, not least the 10-year-old bitcoin. “We believe that people will increasingly trust decentralised forms of governance,” said Facebook and its partners in a statement announcing their proposal.  Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft have not yet signed up. Banks decided not to join the starting roster either because of uncertainties about regulation and concerns over logistical issues that could hamper take-up, several industry executives told the Financial Times.  The launch of Libra ends months of speculation about how the world’s largest social network aims to transform financial services. How will the new currency work? This Q&A has all the answers and here’s a cheat sheet from Alphaville, our financial blog. If you don’t have time to read all the news and analysis we have a two-minute video guide for you. Lex, our investment column, takes a more sceptical look at the proposal.

"Stocks to watch: Renishaw, Persimmon, IG Group, EssilorLuxottica","Release of Beluga whales has potential to hit visitor numbers at Merlin, says Berenberg","Thursday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● Persimmon
 led the UK housebuilders lower after moving to address customer complaints. The group said that from late June it would put 1.5 per cent of sales values into escrow with buyers’ solicitors, so funds could be made available to rectify mistakes at the time of handover. Barclays estimated a hit of up to 1.5 percentage points to Persimmon’s sector-leading gross margin of about 34 per cent. “If any builder has the scope (and some would say the need) to invest in customer care, it is Persimmon,” Barclays said. As the biggest user of the Help To Buy, Persimmon been singled out for criticism due to its relatively low Home Builders Federation customer-satisfaction score, with reports last month suggesting it might be excluded from the government’s subsidy scheme after 2021. “The new homes industry has been pushing the envelope (down) on product quality and specification largely because of Help to Buy and buyers have been prepared to accept a less than perfect product in a way they would simply not accept for a new car or new consumer goods. This has, we believe, been a key factor in the strength of the industry’s margins in the last three to four years and some of that benefit is likely to wind back. Taken together with a visibly weakening pricing environment we still believe that housebuilders’ margins have peaked, that industry commentary on prospects remains too bullish and consensus forecasts (that generally predict rising profits through to 2021) are too high.”Shore Capital ● Renishaw
 led the FTSE 250 fallers on a profit warning. The machine-tool maker blamed a slowdown in Asian demand for position-measurement encoders and from large electronics manufacturers. Management said not to expect conditions to improve in the remainder of the year. The latest guidance was for Renishaw to deliver adjusted pre-tax profit of £117m to £135m on revenue of between £595m and £620m. It had previously aimed for £140m to £160m in earnings on revenue of £635m to £665m, suggesting a 16 per cent cut to profit forecasts at the midpoint.  “What is striking is how rapidly this deterioration in full-year expectations has come through: the guidance that the group is now cutting was only set at the end of January, less than two months ago. This is a reminder of how high the group’s operational gearing is, and how limited its visibility. The obvious follow-on question is whether the bad news is now out, or if there may be more to come. We think it is probably too early to tell, particularly given the pending deadlines around US-China trade talks and Brexit.”Stifel ● IG Group
 dropped on weaker than expected quarterly results from the financial bookmaker, which it blamed on “dull” markets rather than European legislation. Revenue of £108m was down 12 per cent quarter on quarter and 29 per cent year on year as IG looped the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble. Numis downgraded IG to “add” from “buy” and reduced its year-end earnings forecast by 6.1 per cent to 42p per share, with similar cuts pushed through for 2020 and 2021. ● EssilorLuxottica
 dived on an escalation of infighting that has followed the glasses makers’ merger last year. Luxottica founder Leonardo Del Vecchio, whose Delfin vehicle has a 32 per cent stake in the group, accused Essilor management of reneging on the terms of a governance agreement and preventing the exercise of equal powers. “With both sides now looking to be trying to gain control of the company, the magnitude and the pace of synergies are obviously at risk . . . We mainly fear a lengthy confrontation, with a slim probability of the merger being undone. Even if both companies have recovered of late, this could prove distressing for employees after a long and painful antitrust process.”Exane BNP Paribas Sellside stories ● Berenberg downgraded Merlin Entertainments
, the Legoland owner, to “sell” from “hold” with a 315p target price. “We struggle to see the company achieving earnings growth in any division this year, despite its cost-savings plan and continued investment in new sites and hotels,” it said.  Investors should not see Midway, Merlin’s city attraction division that includes Madame Tussauds and Sea Life, as in recovery based on positive like-for-like revenue from the second half of 2018, said Berenberg. Year-on-year comparisons were distorted by the 2017 terrorist attacks in London, which provides an estimated 30 per cent of Midway’s revenue, the broker said.  The broker also highlighted that the Changfeng Ocean World in Shanghai, one of Midway’s top-performing sites, will next month release its two Beluga whales to a sanctuary off the cost of Iceland. As many as half the visitors to Changfeng Ocean World came specifically to see the whale shows, it said, citing management. On Legoland, Berenberg argued that the task of delivering like-for-like growth off ever higher levels of performance was getting tougher. And while Merlin’s Resort Theme Park business had a strong 2018, it was helped by unusually warm and dry weather so further like-for-like sales growth may be difficult in a normal summer, it said. With Merlin trading at 19 times 2019 earnings, investors have mispriced the earnings risk, Berenberg concluded. ● In brief: Assura rated new “neutral” at JPMorgan; Autogrill rated new “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Bodycote cut to “hold” at Berenberg; Capital & Counties rated new “hold” at Panmure Gordon; Compass downgraded to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Derwent London rated new “hold” at Panmure Gordon; Drax cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Eland Oil & Gas rated new “buy” at Stifel; Elior rated new “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Gamma Communications rated new “buy” at Jefferies; Genel downgraded to speculative “buy” at Canaccord; Great Portland Estates rated new “hold” at Panmure Gordon; Helical Bar rated new “buy” at Panmure Gordon; IG Group cut to “add” at Numis Securities; ING raised to “outperform” at RBC; Lanxess upgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; Lookers cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Munich Re downgraded to “hold” at Jefferies; SGS cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Shaftesbury rated new “hold” at Panmure Gordon; Sodexo downgraded to “sell” at Goldman Sachs.

"Mexico’s purge on technocrats fuels fears of expertise shortfall","Critics claim President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is becoming deaf to advice","At 7am every day, Andrés Manuel López Obrador talks directly to Mexicans, promising voters the unvarnished truth. Sometimes the leftwing nationalist president praises the “wise” people but also uses the broadcast to bash “irresponsible technocrats”. Orthodox policy wonks educated at elite US institutions have dominated Mexican policymaking for three decades. But Mr López Obrador has accused them of political bias, and blamed them for Mexico’s inability to escape sluggish growth, corruption and inequality. After taking office in December, he promptly purged government departments of layers of senior and middle management.  Mr López Obrador has, in addition, promised to hold a “people’s poll” on March 21 on whether Mexico’s past five presidents should be put on trial for pursuing “failed” neo-liberal economic policies that he claimed “pillaged” the country.  “They’re definitely hostile to technocrats,” said one former senior official.  In an age of rising populism, the Mexican president, though, is not alone in his suspicion of policymakers. US President Donald Trump prefers to follow his gut, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has ridiculed western-educated economists and piled pressure on the reserve bank, while UK cabinet minister Michael Gove stated bluntly that people “have had enough” of experts.   It’s a learning curve. But it’s steep and it’s going to cost usJorge Andrés Castañeda, IMCO think-tank But the war on technocrats has had consequences beyond Mexico.  When the country’s new government and Pemex held a roadshow in New York in January, it received crushing reviews. One investor described the state oil company’s performance as “absolutely disastrous”, displaying “little clue of finance”. Critics blamed the ramshackle roadshow on a dearth of expertise. Under an austerity drive, Mr López Obrador has limited consultants to three per ministry. And his vow to prevent officials from earning more than the president has led to an exodus of experienced officials — many at the Bank of Mexico, the finance ministry and Pemex — who quit instead of swallowing big pay cuts. “All of this experience will take a long time to recover — they’re shooting themselves in the foot,” cautioned Alejandro Schtulmann, a political consultant.  Mr López Obrador’s cabinet may include respected academics and a former supreme court judge, but critics fear the president is deaf to advice — and worry that no one is willing to challenge him. “It’s a learning curve,” said Jorge Andrés Castañeda at IMCO, a think-tank, of the new policymaking. “But it’s steep and it’s going to cost us.” The president has ploughed ahead with his priorities: a national energy policy, a crackdown on fuel theft, a new security strategy, higher social benefits and an apprenticeship programme to create opportunities and growth. At the same time, the finance ministry has quietly backtracked on its firing binge, hiring some staff back to new roles. “They know they need [technocrats], they just under-estimated how many,” said the former official. While Mr López Obrador is hugely popular, his methods have alarmed investors.  He announced, after a “people’s poll”, that he would scrap a partially built $13bn airport that senior officials had privately assured investors was safe. The president wants to supplement the existing airport by expanding a military base, spurning expert advice that operating the two simultaneously was incompatible. “A lot of the technocrats were very arrogant and, at the end of the day, didn’t deliver . . . you can see why they would be unwilling to talk to them,” said one former policymaker.  Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he would scrap the $13bn airport in Texcoco © Reuters “Hopefully experience will teach López Obrador that aside from good intentions and being courageous, you need to think things through — and listen to other people.” But John Ackerman, a law professor whose wife is the government comptroller, defended the changes. “Some types of knowledge are presented as neutral expertise but have a political agenda,” he said. “All these years, people have been saying ‘we know best’. This is refreshing,” he said. Technocrats are not Mr López Obrador’s only target among the old “establishment”. He has also blasted the media for publishing news with which he disagreed. He said the IMF was wrong when it lowered its 2019 growth target for Mexico to 2.1 per cent from 2.5 per cent. And when Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its forecast to 1 per cent, Mr López Obrador said: “I have other data.” He also called Fitch Ratings’ downgrade of Pemex “hypocritical”. So far, the government has been praised for financial prudence — but investors wondered what would happen if slower growth endangered flagship programmes and promises. “For much of the past couple of decades, Mexico . . . was rarely grouped with ‘problem’ or fragile large emerging market economies,” Alonso Cervera at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients.  “We think that over the coming years, Mexico will run the risk of becoming a more typical EM country . . . and that this will impact how Mexican assets trade — more vulnerable and more volatile.”   ","05.02.2019"
"Asia’s wealthiest man is ready to take on Bezos’s business empire","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One scoop to start: SoftBank’s Vision Fund plans to borrow $4bn against its stakes in Uber and two other Silicon Valley groups, as the investment arm of the Japanese conglomerate looks to hand back cash to investors in its $100bn fund. Read the story by DD’s Robert Smith and Arash Massoudi here. Now back to our regular programme . . .
 Asia’s richest man is taking on the world’s wealthiest man.  Mukesh Ambani (pictured above) wants to transform his oil products behemoth, Reliance Industries, into one of the world’s most powerful consumer-facing companies, taking on ecommerce giant Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos. Ambani has dug deep into Reliance’s coffers to lead a $30bn charge into the digital sector, but the details of his long-term strategy remain a closely guarded secret. One thing is for sure, though: this is just the start of Ambani’s ambitions to reinvent his oil products behemoth. His not so secret weapon is Reliance Jio, a mobile phone operator that has upended India’s telecoms sector, devastating the profits of incumbent operators and attracting more than 300m users.  One Indian media executive told the FT that Ambani views Jio as a valuable tool that holds huge potential to charge for content distributed through its platform. “He wants to be the gatekeeper, who will charge a toll from anyone who wants to come in.” Reliance is notching up acquisitions at a growing pace to help drive its transformation. The company has bought a string of Indian start-ups — ranging from Grab a Grub, which delivers products for small shops, to Reverie, which has built digital platforms in various Indian languages — in a bid to connect online shoppers with local stores. Ambani’s foray into ecommerce has been eased by disruption to incumbents such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, brought on by recent government restrictions. Some in Indian business circles suggest Reliance lobbyists had a hand in the Indian government’s decision to bring in new rules (Reliance took part last year in government consultations preceding the new guidance, to which Amazon and Flipkart were not invited; read more here).  The biggest swoop in Ambani’s recent buying spree came in October, when he paid $750m for majority stakes in Hathway and Den — two of the country’s largest wired broadband providers — tightening its grip on India’s soaring consumption of media content. There’s also the purchase of a music streaming app, Saavn, and minority stakes in two film production houses. Add to that Reliance’s shopping abroad with the acquisition of UK toy retailer Hamleys for £68m earlier this month. As the investment into Jio has mushroomed — Reliance has already committed $30bn in capital to the venture — so too has the group’s debt pile. That has fuelled media speculation about a possible multibillion-dollar investment by SoftBank’s giant Vision Fund, which would put Jio in the company of Uber, DoorDash and Slack, to name a few.   Though Ambani has been reluctant to spell out his ultimate vision for the Reliance’s consumer-facing business, his acquisition spree has given important clues. As one observer puts it, Reliance wants to “own the digital life of the Indian consumer”. With profits from the company’s oil products business in the billions of dollars, the aggressive investment looks set to continue. Check out this video of Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Ambani dancing at his daughter’s wedding in December. Read the full story from the FT’s Simon Mundy here. Döpfner springs into action to take Axel Springer private  Mathias Döpfner, chief executive of Axel Springer (pictured above), loves dealmaking. We at DD know something about it given that the German media group tried to buy the FT in 2015 — but lost out to Japanese rival Nikkei — and later went on to buy Business Insider, the digital financial news company founded by former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget. In addition to that, Döpfner has played an instrumental role in trying to reposition Springer as a digital-focused company by making numerous investments in online properties while selling regional newspapers across Germany, where it still controls the country’s top selling daily newspaper Bild. But the news business — print or digital — remains a tough business to navigate. That’s true for the FT as well as for Springer and now even internet darlings such as BuzzFeed, Vice News and Huffington Post, which were once seen as the future of news media, are now struggling to meet revenue targets. This partly explains why Springer said on Wednesday that the group’s founding family and Döpfner are teaming up with private equity firm KKR in a bid to take the powerful media group private. Springer’s stock price has dropped more than 25 per cent over the past year as some investors aren’t too sure about its growth strategy. But those running the business are convinced of the opposite and are clearly ready to buy out the entire media group to raise the long-term value of the company. Read more about the deal here. You can relive the story of how Springer missed out on buying the FT here. Is Baoshang Bank part of a broader banking crisis in China? What happens when a financier for China’s political elite takes over a commercial bank? The results might look something like Baoshang Bank, which recently required a government bailout and is now sending ripples through the country’s interbank market. Baoshang was for years under the control of Xiao Jianhua (pictured below), a broker of investment deals for some of China’s most powerful politicians through the 2000s and into this decade.  His luck turned, however, when China’s president Xi Jinping turned his sights on aggressive businessmen stirring up financial risk. (DD readers might remember the plights of Wu Xiaohui and Ye Jianming.) Xiao was abducted by Chinese agents in January 2017 from the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong and hasn’t been heard from since. But his legacy lives on in the financial risks he created. Read the full FT story here. Baoshang is thought to have mainly lent to companies connected to Xiao’s financial conglomerate, Tomorrow Group. With that holding company now in disrepair, Baoshang is understandably having trouble. So much so that the People’s Bank of China earlier this week was forced to explicitly guarantee some of its corporate deposits and interbank loans, a drastic measure that has hurt sentiment. The big question today in China is whether Xiao and Baoshang are an anomaly, a one-off case not to be repeated. Or whether similar asset quality problems have been allowed to fester. “Is Baoshang part of a corruption-related clean-up or the start of what could become a series of bank failures?” J Capital, an independent research house focused on China, wrote in a research note this week.

"Stocks to watch: Sirius Minerals, Dixons Carphone, Crispr, IAG","Wood Group retreats after Exane raises accounting red flags","Tuesday 13:30 GMT What’s happening ● Shares in Sirius Minerals
 dropped after the developer of a polyhalite mine in Yorkshire proposed a new path to raising $3bn of senior debt needed for the project. The company switched its plan from two tranches to three, saying its move was to “reduce both the risk and the quantum” of any government funding package.  The new structure involved raising up to $750m via an uncovered bond, followed by up to $1.5bn of commercial bank debt, and finally a loan guaranteed by the Government’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA) to cover the remainder. These would be drawn sequentially after construction milestones were reached. Sirius said it had sufficient cash to continue work at the project into the second quarter of 2019 and expected the refinancing to be completed within this timeframe. “Whilst the new structure mitigates the projects’ reliance on the IPA/UK government guarantee, the addition of the uncovered bond adds another degree of complexity which could put at risk the prior timing for financial close by the first quarter of 2019. It also puts upward pressure on the interest cost.”JPMorgan Cazenove ● Dixons Carphone rallied after its Christmas trading update showed market share gains in the UK and a strong international performance, which offset continued problems at the mobile division. The retailer said UK and Irish sales of electrical goods rose 2 per cent year on year, against a consensus for 1 per cent growth, as gaming kits proved the star performers. Sellside stories ● Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Wood Group to “neutral” from “outperform” in a European oil services sector review.  Full-year results from the oil majors will probably provide “steady as she goes” outlooks on capital expenditure, as their budgets have already been reset for oil at around $50 a barrel, said Exane. Offshore investment looks secure as projects continue to work even with oil below $40 a barrel, but more pain may be felt by US shale producers and recent announcements suggest first-half 2019 activity may fall sequentially by between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, it said.  On Wood Group, Exane said that debt reduction targets look challenging and accounting concerns need to be addressed. It listed the treatment of exceptional costs, acquisition-related adjustments, lease liabilities and the presentation of cash exceptionals as problem areas clouding the valuation.  As part of the same research, Exane upgraded TechnipFMC to “neutral” from “underweight”.  ● Citigroup downgraded Crispr Therapeutics, the gene-editing technology developer, to “sell” from “neutral” with a $21 target price.  A deep dive into experimental treatments for haemoglobinopathy — a genetic defect that affects red blood cells — suggests Crispr’s CTX-001 therapy was “at best equivalent to more advanced competitors” with its own possible dangers. With Bluebird Bio and Global Blood expected to launch treatments in the US in 2020, Crispr lags peers in the race to market by five years, Citi said. The broker also highlighted concerns about presentation data from rival developer Editas that raised the possibility of impaired blood cell production from edited cells.  “Despite an innovative gene-editing platform, we believe Crispr’s near-term valuation driver and lead programme in related blood disorders substantially lags more advanced competitors and with Crispr’s CTX-001 not an obviously better approach, potentially impacting eventual [market] share.”Citi ● In brief: AB InBev raised to “top pick” at RBC; Aggreko downgraded to “reduce” at Peel Hunt; Air France-KLM raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Babcock upgraded to “add” at Peel Hunt; Circle Property rated “buy” at Cenkos; easyJet cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Eon raised to “buy” at HSBC; Equiniti raised to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Faurecia upgraded to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Henkel downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Hochtief upgraded to “buy” at Société Générale; IAG downgraded to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; IG Design rated “buy” at Canaccord; Italgas downgraded to “sell” at Citigroup; Lufthansa raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Midwich upgraded to “buy” at Canaccord; Outokumpu downgraded to “underweight” at JPMorgan; Petrofac rated “buy” at HSBC; Red Eléctrica cut to “neutral” at Citigroup; Rentokil cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; Restore upgraded to “buy” at Peel Hunt; Ricardo cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; Shell cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Smart Metering upgraded to “buy” at Peel Hunt; SSAB downgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; St James’s Place cut to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Swedish Match upgraded to “buy” at Citigroup; Voestalpine upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan.

"Why European banks repeatedly fall short on Wall Street","Investor pressure on Barclays and Deutsche Bank to retrench is just the latest blow","Banks such as Deutsche expanded in the US at the turn of this century but that business has diminished and has been hard to replace © Bloomberg Near the Bank of England, there is a statue of George Peabody, “American philanthropist and great benefactor of the poor”. He was also a financier who came to the City of London, the world’s undisputed financial centre, and formed a bank with John Pierpont Morgan’s father in 1854. Wall Street was then a poor cousin to the City in investment banking, but those roles have reversed. JPMorgan Chase, one of Peabody, Morgan & Co’s successors, now has a market value 10 times that of Barclays and 20 times that of Deutsche Bank. The place for financiers to seek fortunes is New York, rather than London or Frankfurt. A gulf has emerged in power and profitability between capital markets in the US and Europe since the mid-2000s, when Europe’s banks came close to catching US institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. It may become greater still — some of Deutsche Bank’s biggest shareholders want it to cut back its lossmaking Wall Street operations. Barclays is also under investor pressure. Edward Bramson, an activist who took the opposite journey to Peabody, leaving the UK in 1975 to become a financier in New York, is pressing for it to shrink its investment bank. The latter includes the former US operations of Lehman Brothers, which Barclays acquired after its collapse in the 2008 financial crisis. If Mr Bramson and Deutsche’s investors succeed, European banks will no longer try to compete head-on with big Wall Street firms. They will instead retreat to a less profitable continent, where banks have been restructuring and shedding bad loans since the crisis. By dividing London from Frankfurt and Paris, Brexit is likely to fragment Europe further. Most of the European banks that most please investors have pulled back from volatile and risky investment banking in favour of steadier consumer banking in domestic markets, and investment management. UBS is among the most highly valued European banks, having curbed trading in 2012 to focus on private banking.  Rivals may have little choice but to follow. Banks like Deutsche expanded in the US at the turn of this century but that business has diminished and has been hard to replace. Their efforts to advance on Wall Street through sheer size and use of highly leveraged capital have been hampered by tighter banking regulation. US banks have adjusted more easily to advising on mergers and raising capital for companies, helped by old relationships with US multinational corporations. Banks such as Goldman face their own challenges but they have history and roots in the US market on their side. Deutsche, which ranked among the top three global investment banks after the crisis, has dropped out of the top five. There is a long history of European banks going to New York and trying to break into Wall Street. Credit Suisse was a pioneer in 1988 when it bought a stake in First Boston, later assimilating the bank entirely. Deutsche made another advance by buying Bankers Trust, which specialised in derivatives, in 1998. UBS bought the US retail broker Paine Webber two years later. But while Goldman and Morgan Stanley (another descendant of Peabody’s bank) have stuck with their push into Europe, cushioned by the profitability of their home operations, the going has been tougher for Europeans in the US. Today’s pressure on Barclays and Deutsche is the latest manifestation of investors asking why they bother. The answer is that Wall Street, having taken its lead from London in the 19th century, is a bigger and more profitable market than Europe. Margins are higher and there is greater opportunity. It has a deep pool of private savings and is the home base of big investment institutions such as BlackRock and Vanguard. Europe’s banks not only hoped to participate but to learn how it was done. This is a mirror image of the Victorian era, when Peabody’s bank, later renamed JS Morgan & Co after his partner Junius Spencer Morgan, raised money for US projects such as railroads from London investors. Companies in the FTSE 100 or the CAC 40 in France now want to tap US investors to float companies and raise debt, and can do that through Wall Street. For big European companies and investors, the imbalance of power between US and European banks may not seem too troubling at the moment — there is always someone to serve them. It is a greater problem for European banks, in particular Deutsche, which has a highly competitive home market and cannot simply retreat to Germany. Mr Bramson argues that focusing on retail banking is a more attractive notion for Barclays. Its UK bank is now very profitable, with a return on equity three times that of its corporate and investment bank. But banking is cyclical and Jes Staley, Barclays’ chief executive, is right to value its breadth — one day, an opportunity may swing back. It is more than sentimentality to hope that at least one European bank can maintain a top tier presence on Wall Street. Peabody’s seated figure outside the Bank of England shows the long-term value of venturing into the world’s leading capital market and sticking to it. It matters for London amid the turmoil and uncertainty of Brexit, and it also matters for Europe. john.gapper@ft.com

"Gold glitters on dovish signals","Mike Mackenzie’s daily analysis of what’s moving global markets","FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email. Central banks are bending on the policy front and of all financial markets, gold is glittering. Newcrest has made several bolt-on acquisitions of ore deposits, rather than the mega-mergers pursued by its larger rivals © Reuters Heightened risk aversion late last year explained the appeal of buying gold and yet the rally has continued into 2019 with the precious metal topping $1,341 an ounce today, a new peak since April last year. If markets are truly putting a torrid December behind, gold should be weakening as Japan’s yen, another classic haven, has been doing lately. Except gold has now climbed almost 12 per cent from a low of $1,200 in mid-November and appears set to test the $1,360 level soon, its high point from January last year.  Some people argue that the unresolved China-US trade spat, Brexit and other political flashpoints such as the European Parliament elections keep gold bugs in clover. That might explain why a rebound in the US dollar has not hurt gold of late, whereas from April last year, a stronger reserve currency did hurt. Gold does appear to be helped by signs of a dollar topping out at the moment. The dollar index sits under 97 and has yet to rise through November’s peak of 97.54.  Also of note, the drop in US 10-year real yields to about 0.80 per cent after they spiked to 1.20 per cent in November is another source of support for gold.   For a non-interest bearing asset, gold starts to look a lot better if global interest rates are truly heading lower, particularly in the US, where the appeal of cash through a three-month Treasury bill that pays about 2.4 per cent still remains attractive.  Gold’s latest rally also reflects hefty central bank buying, which in 2018 climbed to its highest level for almost half a century last year as the likes of Russia sold US Treasury debt and diversified their reserves. Where things get interesting is what gold’s resilience suggests loiters just beyond the markets’ horizon. The metal’s latest high point today coincides with dovish central bank chatter and data, all of which suggests a higher risk of much lower global bond yields and weaker economic growth. True, that entails subdued inflation, but gold’s solid performance of late reflects expectations of a greater willingness among central bankers to try to stimulate consumer price pressures through easy money.  That was the big concern flagged by gold’s surge from $700 in late 2008 to a high of $1,900 by September 2011 as the Fed upped its quantitative easing efforts. As the goal of higher inflation has faltered, gold once again shows signs of momentum as central banks prepare to follow the cycle of soak, wash and rinse.   Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan governor, told parliament today that the central bank would consider easing policy if currency moves affect consumer prices. Such an admission only affirms the message from the bond market as the 10-year yield has pretty much been below zero since late last year, an area not visited for any length of time since November 2016.  The Aussie dollar took a knock today and remains mired near lows not seen since late 2015/early 2016 after the release of dovish Reserve Bank meeting minutes. As a proxy for China’s growth prospects, Australia and Germany are two sensitive barometers.   Indeed, today, the Zew Indicator of Current Conditions in Germany fell 12.6 points month on month to 15 in February, its lowest point since 2014 and well below expectations for 23, according to analysts polled by Reuters. Another red flag fluttered with Sweden’s inflation data falling short of forecasts and placing a big asterisk next to its December policy tightening — that still left interest rates at a quarter of a point below zero — by the Riksbank.  Brad Betchel at Jefferies says: “The [consumer price index] print out of Sweden calls into question the wisdom of the Riksbank hike recently and I like looking to the Riksbank as a leading indicator of eurozone central bank thinking. The fact that they hiked was a good sign in my book and gave me confidence that the European Central Bank could surprise in the fall. The CPI print and the persistent weakness in data in the eurozone make it difficult to hold on to that call. But holding on for now I am.” Tomorrow markets will be scrutinising the Federal Reserve meeting minutes for January. Investors anticipate discussion about when the balance sheet contraction halts. But there has also been signs that the Fed is looking at altering its approach towards the inflation part of its dual mandate and that definitely matters for gold too. Bill O’Donnell at Citi notes today how there are signs of a shift under way at the Fed, as “inflation expectations are not only well-anchored, but anchored to a historic floor by some measures”. A recent Bloomberg interview with former New York Fed president Bill Dudley highlighted a focus on the Fed hitting a 2 per cent inflation target on average or, in other words, if it misses on the downside, it will let things run a little hotter to get inflation back up over time.  As Bill notes: “Our conclusion is that any perceived or actual shift toward an inflation-averaging regime . . . should, all else equal, steepen curves, boost Tips [Treasury inflation-protected security] break-evens and raise the term premium, over time.” Any central bank willing to let things run hot should help gold, so there does appear potential for further strength. Vale — David Shellock This is a very sad day for the FT and our Markets team as we heard that Dave Shellock passed away. Dave joined the FT in 1999 and was one of the London editors when I arrived at the paper in 2006 and he certainly improved my copy. Readers of the Markets section would know that Dave anchored the Global Overview for the paper and web. Dave’s deep knowledge of markets and professionalism will be missed by us all.  Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar HSBC tolls for UK banking — When a “boring” bank reports disappointing results, the alarm bells should ring. Slowing credit in Asia was highlighted by HSBC, which noted that loans and advances to customers in the region expanded 5.5 per cent year on year in the final quarter of 2018. That’s well shy of the double-digit gains seen in 2017.  HSBC also reported expected credit losses that were higher than analysts expected, primarily due to a $165m charge in the UK, reflecting the economic uncertainty of Brexit. That was enough to pull shares in the bank into negative territory for 2019 today. Also of note when looking at the year-to-date performance of key members of the FTSE 350 bank index is how Standard Chartered also lags the big UK lenders.  The market clearly thinks HSBC and StanChart face a tough time given their focus on Asia and emerging markets. Yet a nasty Brexit is not going to help UK-focused banks.  Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, notes that HSBC warned over possible bad debts in the UK and that this “will have a negative read-across to other UK banks as HSBC tends to adopt a fairly conservative approach to lending”.  Walmart sure enjoyed the holidays — Strong fourth-quarter results from the retail giant affirm doubts over December’s shocking drop in retail sales. Walmart’s like-for-like US sales rose 4.2 per cent in the three months to the end of January and that’s powered a nice bump in its shares today. But the retailer is holding its guidance for the current financial year, flagging comparable US sales to slow to between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent, excluding fuel. The Macro Volatility slide — Another aspect of dovish central banks is a clear slide in market volatility. Here, from Credit Suisse, is a look at implied volatility on a six-month contract for US 10-year interest rates setting a new low. The bank adds: “This suggests we may be in a ‘lower for longer’ rate regime as slowing global growth and a patient Fed puts both a floor and ceiling on longer-dated yields. With macro vols all moderating significantly, it’s no surprise equity vols have also fallen, with the Vix now back to the 39th percentile low.” Chart: US rate volatility (6-month v 10-year) making all-time lows

"World Bank’s Jim Yong Kim to join private equity firm","Global Infrastructure Partners led consortium that bought Gatwick airport in 2009","Jim Yong Kim will leave the presidency of the World Bank to join Global Infrastructure Partners, a New York-based private equity fund, after accepting a one-year cooling off period during which he will be barred from doing business with the organisation he has led since 2012.    Mr Kim’s sudden move to Wall Street stunned staff and directors at the Washington-based institution, at a time when its largest shareholder — the US, led by Donald Trump — has expressed deep scepticism about the value of multilateral institutions.  A primary concern for the World Bank in managing Mr Kim’s departure has been to insulate him from possible conflicts of interest: at GIP he will be working on infrastructure investments in developing economies, which is the World Bank’s core business.  There must be some big pull out there that explains it, but I’m disappointed in the sense that it doesn’t somehow befit the nature of the institutionJohannes Linn, former World Bank official Even before his February 1 exit from the World Bank, Mr Kim told directors he was recusing himself from day-to-day oversight of its projects. In addition, Mr Kim will be prevented from dealing with the World Bank during his first year at GIP.    According to people close to the matter, Mr Kim’s departure for GIP took shape around the time of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires six weeks ago, when conversations about the new position heated up.  Mr Kim started telling some World Bank senior staff — including Sandie Okoro, the general counsel — that he intended to leave for GIP last week, and then informed top executives of the bank at the weekend. At 9.13am on Monday he emailed board members to inform them of his decision, summoning them to a meeting 17 minutes later, at 9.30am.   “The opportunity to join the private sector was unexpected, but I’ve concluded that this is the path through which I will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change and the infrastructure deficit in emerging markets,” he then said in a note to staff.  His departure has triggered what is expected to be a hard-fought succession race, but supporters of the World Bank worry that the circumstances of Mr Kim’s exit risked demeaning the institution and its work.  “There must be some big pull out there that explains it, but I’m disappointed in the sense that it doesn’t somehow befit the nature of the institution, that you could just dump it in this particular way,” said Johannes Linn, a former World Bank official and non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think-tank.   At a town-hall meeting on Tuesday in a packed atrium at the World Bank’s headquarters, Mr Kim said he was leaving because the opportunity fell in his “lap” and sought to reassure staff that he still had great faith in the institution, according to one person briefed on the meeting. Kristalina Georgieva, who will be interim president after Mr Kim leaves, then added her own words stressing the continuity and resilience of the World Bank.  GIP — which did not return a request for comment — is among a breed of private investment funds that have emerged as leading financiers of renewable power generation assets that are replacing legacy coal and gas plants. The identity of the private equity group where Mr Kim was headed was first reported by Bloomberg News.  GIP — now led by former Credit Suisse investment banking head Adebayo Ogunlesi — last year began raising money for a potential $20bn fund, just a year after raising a record-breaking $15.8bn vehicle, much of it earmarked for assets in the energy and transport sectors.   GIP led a consortium of investors that bought London’s Gatwick airport for £1.5bn in 2009. Last month the group sold a majority stake in the airport to the French infrastructure company Vinci at an equity value of just under £6bn, just days after the hub was shuttered for several days over sightings of drones.  The infrastructure sector reached a record $450bn of assets under management at the end of 2017, according to Preqin, with specialists such as GIP and its rival Brookfield increasingly vying with traditional private equity group such as Blackstone and KKR in a race for cash and assets.","08.01.2019"
"The first-gen wealth creators who struggle to talk to their kids about money","It is essential for entrepreneurs to talk to their children about wealth","Every culture has its own version, but in Britain the saying goes: from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations. The anecdote about how family money can easily disappear is particularly poignant for entrepreneurs trying to navigate whether, or how, to pass along their wealth to their children. Compared to the institutionally wealthy, who may see themselves as custodians of family wealth, entrepreneurs or first-generation wealth creators can have a more difficult time talking to the next generation about money. Popular narratives of “trustafarians” and children or family businesses damaged by excessive wealth “have made entrepreneurs shrewder”, says Judy Lin Walsh, principal at Banyan Global, the Boston-based family business advisers. “It’s a real fear that the second generation can squander the wealth and there will be nothing left for the third.” Duncan MacIntyre, the UK chief executive of Lombard Odier private bank, says clients often ask him: “How do I stop my child from turning left on the plane?” When it comes to estate planning, wealth advisers say there are fundamental differences between entrepreneur clients and those who have inherited wealth, which makes the transfer of wealth more complex. Money is the result of an entrepreneur’s focus, rather than the cause. “A true entrepreneur is interested in the thing they do, not the by-product of the thing they do, which is the money,” says Graeme Dreghorn, of Ascot Lloyd, a financial adviser. One consequence is a preoccupation with passing down their business to their children, regardless of whether the next generation shares their parent’s professional interests. Entrepreneurs tend to be optimists with a high appetite for risk, causing them to have a different mentality on timelines. The first hurdle for entrepreneurs looking to talk to their children about money is confronting their own mortality. “To be uber successful you have to have an almost single-minded pursuit of growing your business and making that venture hit it big,” says Walsh. The moving on of wealth is the first time you have to confront the idea that there’s an end dateAscot Lloyd’s Graeme Dreghorn She says clients in their seventies can still think they have 20 years to prepare. “It’s hard to think about preparing the next generation because most entrepreneurs still feel like they’re in their prime.” Dreghorn says: “The moving on of wealth is the first time you have to confront the idea that there’s an end date.” As entrepreneurs can also be very controlling, with a singular expertise, they can err by choosing to “take care of it” without including their families in discussions about wealth planning. Dreghorn says: “The biggest mistake entrepreneurs can make is to assume that they’ll always make the right decision.” “Skills that define entrepreneurs are strong decision-making abilities, knowing what they want, acting on what they believe in and know,” says Viola Steinhoff Werner, head of next generation and families at Credit Suisse. “These skills are not so helpful when seeking an open dialogue about something they might not know as well or feel comfortable discussing.” Entrepreneurs can be divided in their views of how much money should go to the next generation. Among the kinds of entrepreneurial wealthy Rachel Harrington works with in succession planning at Coutts, she sees “realists”, “spenders” and “philanthropists”. “These types are not binary,” she explains. “They’re more like dials.” Some entrepreneurs believe their wealth is there to be spent and want their family to enjoy it while it lasts. But a consequence could be allowing children to get used to a lifestyle they will not be able to sustain. “It’s very tough to bring your children up with one degree of comfort and expect them as adults to not have any of what they previously had,” says Matthew Fleming, partner at Stonehage Fleming, the multi-family office. Guilt about time spent away from family while building the business can colour an entrepreneur’s view of how much they should provide financially for their children. Others want their children to have the same upbringing that they did, without extreme wealth. Entrepreneurs such as American billionaire Warren Buffett have spoken about their decision to use wealth as a “kickstart” for their children, supporting them to a point but also encouraging them to fend for themselves. Buffett famously told Fortune magazine in 1986 that the perfect amount to leave an heir is, “enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing”. “Entrepreneurs can assume that the same purpose that drove them will drive their children and often that’s not the case,” says Fleming. Entrepreneurs struggle with how to best pass along the hunger that made them successful, while not necessarily forcing their children to struggle as much as they had to. Approaches vary, says Walsh. Some choose to “stoke a fire” or limit the amount that is given over time, providing children with a sum to prove that they can effectively manage. Some advisors say entrepreneurs can teach their children to be more effective managing money as adults by decreasing cash allowances from weekly to monthly, to every six months to once a year, to encourage long-term thinking. Others recommend placing the children in charge of a sum with a directive to invest, or to place in a non-profit and track its progress. Teaching children to give money away effectively can be more difficult than teaching them to grow it, says Walsh. In other cases, Walsh has been instructed to set up trusts to hold the wealth for the grandchildren, passing over their parents using “skip-generation” trusts. “I’ve had clients who are billionaires who have told their children: ‘You will inherit nothing; it’s all going to subsequent generations’.” It is essential for entrepreneurs to have conversations with their children about wealth as early as possible, advisers say, to not only tell them what they want, but also to listen to what subsequent generations want, too. These conversations are an opportunity for families to discuss individual goals as well as their family values, which can be written down into family charters or constitutions to govern wealth for future generations. They are also useful for families to discuss how the money was made, a narrative that may not be the same for the wealth creator and their children, who may have more limited knowledge of their parents’ careers. It is essential for entrepreneurs to have conversations with their children about wealth as early as possible, advisers say Having these difficult conversations, says Harrington, is essential for helping children understand that wealth generation can be a painful, difficult process and to place realistic expectations on themselves. “It’s important to be able to tell the story of how the money was created and how much effort goes into creating that kind of wealth.” Walsh says: “You might not have seen your family for dinner every night. Your children might not have had the benefit of seeing everything you did.” This can also help to reduce the pressure that having extremely successful parents can place on children. “You can inadvertently put your children off being an entrepreneur because they’re trying to live up to an ideal and failing,” Harrington adds. At the same time, artificially recreating the scarcity in which they achieved success is not necessarily the best approach for entrepreneur parents looking to raise driven children. “Entrepreneurs need to recognise that even with the best will in the world, they cannot recreate the circumstances for their children in which they grew up,” says Harrington. Not every child wants to be the recipient of a fortune, nor to live in the shadow of an exceptionally successful entrepreneur. “Psychologically, if you feel like you didn’t earn it, it can be really challenging to live with or benefit from the greatness of your parents,” says Walsh. Meanwhile, the arrival of wealth can be difficult for the entrepreneurs who spent their entire professional lives focused on the work that created it. “Some entrepreneurs find themselves completely bereft when they have created their wealth and sold their business because it was the process of creating wealth that defined them, not their wealth,” says Fleming. “But many are serial entrepreneurs as a result,” he says. “They start again.” This is increasingly the case as entrepreneurs generate wealth earlier than ever before. Previously, where wealth generators would have been approaching adult children to discuss the transfer of their finances, men and women are becoming affluent earlier, while their children are still young. “Wealth generators are creating their wealth . . . in their late thirties or mid forties, so their children are at a different point and the conversation starts earlier,” says Camilla Stowell, head of wealth and investment management at Coutts. “It’s easier to have those conversations earlier rather than later.” Still, says Dreghorn, regardless of whether a family gives everything, or nothing, to the next generation, the most important thing is to have the conversation about the transfer of wealth, even when it’s difficult. Along with taxes, “death is one of the two certainties in life. If you don’t confront it, it will get worse later.”","10.05.2019"
"Jean-Charles Naouri puts the ‘computer in his brain’ to the test","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

 When sizing up the big beasts of the French business elite, there are few who dispute that Jean-Charles Naouri is the smartest of the lot.  But while friends and critics alike may all agree that the chief executive and main shareholder of supermarket group Casino has a mind like a steel trap, Naouri’s penchant for financial complexity and leverage means he is now battling to retain control of his empire. “He has a computer in his brain,” says one analyst. “But that’s part of the problem. He’s too smart for his own good.” Naouri controls Casino through what one might politely call an “only in France” corporate structure. Above Casino there are his three publicly listed holding companies — Rallye, Finatis and Foncière Euris — and another private one called Euris. All four entities had to file for bankruptcy protection last month, as the slumping value of Casino’s shares put pressure on the more than €3.5bn of debts at these holding companies. DD’s Rob Smith dissected the vulnerabilities in the structure at length last year, which our friends over at FT Alphaville have handily collated here.   
  Hedge funds have been ratcheting up their bets against what Rob dubs Naouri’s “wedding cake of debt” for the best part of a year. Although it’d be wrong to think they have all made money out of his bankruptcy protection filing — check out Rob’s column on the hedge funds hit with the curse of Howie Hubler. When the FT’s Harriet Agnew spoke to Naouri last year — in a rare on the record interview from the shy and intense 70-year old — he warned that those betting against the company did so “at their risk and peril”, and is able to recite from memory the names of those funds who have short positions in Casino. And Harriet and Rob put together the essential profile of Naouri over the weekend. Here are some key takeaways: Naouri eschews flashy displays of wealth: he collects Greek and Latin books, not sports cars and yachts.

He is notoriously security conscious: as well as using private bodyguards he is even rumoured to have his office checked regularly for bugs.

While beloved by staunch allies such as Sanofi chairman Serge Weinberg, Naouri’s history of bitter disputes over assets mean he has his fair share of enemies as well.

 You should read the whole thing — particularly if you want to hear what long-term adversary and famed short-seller Carson Block thinks of the recent developments. But we’ll leave DD readers with this great quote from another big beast of the French establishment: “Naouri’s takeover method proceeds in three stages: charm, conquest, eviction. He built his empire through a combination of financial engineering and a vision for the retail sector.” Why is Blackstone going warehouse shopping? About a 90-minute drive south-west of Chicago, the suburban community of Joliet is as good a place as any to size up the dilemma confronting real estate investors in America. Four decades ago, this city seemed like a decent place to own a department store and a 14-screen multiplex. The city’s mall has been owned by retail giant Westfield and a certain private equity group named Blackstone.  But to find the hottest property in Joliet today, you follow lumbering juggernauts a few miles down a dusty access road to a building that plays a crucial role in Jeff Bezos’s campaign to revolutionise retail.  Built by Singapore-based GLP, this warehouse is one of dozens that Amazon operates on the fringes of affluent cities. And Blackstone is buying. The world’s biggest private equity group hoovered up 1,300 warehouses from GLP this weekend, in a $19bn deal that is the largest private real estate transaction ever (read the FT story here). It also represents a big bet on ecommerce, and the conviction that the ambitions of pioneers like Bezos will grow faster than builders can accommodate them. But real estate is a fickle business. Just ask the new owners of the mall up the road, which Blackstone sold in 2003, back when Amazon was mostly a bookstore. Sears, which built the Joliet mall in 1978 and was an anchor tenant for four decades, closed its doors this year. Bayer biz to be latest PE megadeal? Just weeks after one of Europe’s largest deals since the financial crisis, and the buyout guys are hungry for more. BC Partners is putting together a bid to buy Bayer’s animal health unit, which could fetch up to €8bn and become one of the largest transactions in the continent since the boom years of a decade ago. The London-based private equity group is exploring to team up either with a rival or with an investor — either a pension fund or a sovereign wealth fund, people following the process told DD. But competition will be steep for BC Partners. Cinven and Permira are teaming up. CVC and Advent could also join the fight for the asset in what promises to be a competitive process even if expectations from the seller are deemed high. The deal comes at a time when private equity groups are raising their biggest funds at their fastest pace but the industry keep wondering: when will the music stop? Read Javier Espinoza’s scoop here.

"Private equity cools on the UK over Brexit uncertainty","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One scoop to start: Roland Rudd, one of London’s most-connected executives, has approached WPP about a possible management buyout of Finsbury, the corporate communications group he founded. Get the details from DD’s Arash Massoudi here. It used to be the number one destination for private money in Europe looking for a home to do deals. But the UK is now a second-rate destination for dealmakers who in light of Brexit are increasingly finding themselves more comfortable doing deals in historically smaller markets, such as France and Spain. After speaking to multiple executives, DD’s Javier Espinoza reports back that the industry’s main concern is how to price the risks associated with a potentially disorderly UK departure from the EU, which some expect could lead to a massive flux in sterling prices.  They are also worried that the political infighting in the UK will lead to a government led by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been vocal about taxing the rich. Figures from Invest Europe, the trade association representing venture capital and private equity groups on the continent, revealed dealmaking outside the UK went up by 13 per cent to €63.9bn last year while the UK went down by 12 per cent to €16.7bn. Ouch. It’s not just capital that is choosing to go elsewhere. Johannes Huth, pictured below, the European head of KKR moved to Paris in 2017, as he praised business-friendly reforms in the country, including favourable tax arrangements. Others have told DD they could jump if the lack of clarity over what Brexit means continues.  Buyout groups have taken the worst-case scenario view: that the UK crashes out of the EU and the pound takes an immediate hit as businesses find themselves unable to hire people. In some cases investors are demanding their exposure to the UK is capped at no more than a third in the companies a fund invests in. It’s not all doom and gloom. Some investors are willing to be contrarians when it comes to UK investing, like US billionaire Warren Buffett. During a recent interview with the FT, Buffett said he would invest in the UK regardless of the outcome of Brexit. He said: “We welcome the chance to put money out any place where we think we understand and sort of trust the system.” Still, some worry the damage will be beyond repair. “I’m afraid the money that has left will not come back,” a seasoned private equity executive told DD.  Read Javier Espinoza’s full Brexit and private equity analysis here. Question looms over Uber IPO mess Reporters who covered the 2016 US presidential campaign learned one painful lesson on November 9: the work only intensifies after election night. The top banks on Wall Street have been taught something of the same after taking two of Silicon Valley’s brightest stars public. Shares of ride-hailing app Uber 
have tumbled 18 per cent in just two days, leaving investors who bought at the $45 a share initial public offering price nursing heady losses. Rival Lyft is down more than 30 per cent from its IPO.  The declines have caused hand-wringing by the banks — JPMorgan and Credit Suisse for Lyft and Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America for Uber — that led the two multibillion-dollar floats. While attention centred on lock-up agreements after Lyft’s stock market debut, another narrative is taking hold in the wake of Uber’s poor performance: public markets simply don’t believe the valuations ascribed by private investors like SoftBank. Bankers have collected some handsome fees for their work on these IPOs. Uber’s underwriters are splitting some $106.2m in fees, including $40.6m for Morgan Stanley. But those declining stock prices are heaping pressure on the litany of privately held companies that have prepared for debuts of their own: think WeWork and Airbnb. “Discovering the correct price and floating the shares without tumult has now defied two syndicates of highly competent Wall Street underwriters,” said Rett Wallace, co-founder of Triton Research. The drop for Uber came despite what chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, pictured below, described as a conservative approach to pricing its IPO. The $45 price was near the bottom end of the indicated range. Bankers factored Lyft’s slide in the weeks since its listing into their thinking, and they tried to pick investors who would hold the stock “for the long term” rather than quickly selling.  Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to prevent the drop in Uber shares, as we all know now. There’s much more to read on the flagging IPO.

 EssilorLuxottica: Blurred vision EssilorLuxottica says it has reached “a settlement agreement to overcome” its “governance issues” — namely the fight between its French and Italian partners about which side really controls the newly merged eyewear giant. The row between Luxottica’s Leonardo Del Vecchio and Essilor’s Hubert Sagnières, pictured, highlights the difficulty of merging a founder-run Italian family business with a publicly run company — and the cultural clashes that could imperil other so-called European champions. This particular Franco-Italian fight has been simmering since the 2017 merger but burst into public view in March of this year over the appointment of a new chief executive of the group, writes the FT’s David Keohane from Paris.  Essilor accused Del Vecchio of pushing his lieutenant, Francesco Milleri, as the new chief executive and in doing so going for “a de facto attempt to take control of the new group, without any premium offered to shareholders”. While Del Vecchio said that Milleri was merely “a scapegoat” and that Sagnières was attempting to run the company without paying heed to the Italian owner, which happens to also be the biggest single shareholder, controlling close to a third of the capital. The deal between the two sides announced on Monday will see Milleri and Laurent Vacherot, chief executive of Essilor, take on more power at the group while both, crucially, will not be candidates for the group CEO position. Will it be enough to cool the tensions on both sides? Citi says no: “We still see a big culture clash between the entrepreneurial spirit of Luxottica’s key people and the managerial ones of Essilor. Hence, where we read Del Vecchio we read Milleri and where we read Sagnières we read Vacherot.” And the fact that EssilorLuxottica shares ended the day flat on Monday doesn’t suggest there is an oversupply of confidence from investors ahead of an AGM on Thursday which could still yield fireworks.

"Big drop in US homebuilders’ shares could spell trouble","Rising interest rates and structural pressures have dimmed the outlook for housing","The US housing market was at the heart of the financial crisis that rippled through the global economy a decade ago. Today, emerging cracks in a property recovery are darkening the outlook for housing-related stocks — and possibly further afield. US house prices kept deflating until 2012, but since then they have climbed more than 50 per cent, propelled by a slowly-healing economy, falling unemployment and interest rates at record lows. That buoyed home-builder stocks, with the Dow Jones Home Construction index, a $47bn-in-market-capitalisation benchmark, delivering almost twice the return of the broader US stock market over the five years to 2017. But the bloom came off last year, as the index fell more than 40 per cent from peak to trough. While homebuilder stocks have enjoyed a welcome bounce over the past couple of months, they are still down 32 per cent from the top. Concerns over the sector — and what the deterioration means for the broader US economy — continue to swirl. “The psychology in the housing market has altered,” says Michelle Meyer, head of US economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “That could be very forceful in dictating future volumes in home sales.”  Indeed, the number of US homes sold fell to a three-year low in December, according to data released last week by the National Association of Realtors. The tumble, the second-sharpest month-on-month drop in home purchases since prices began to recover in 2012, may not have halted the recovery in housing stocks, but raises important questions over whether rising US interest rates are now biting into the real economy. The Federal Reserve lifted rates four times last year, nudging the cost of new mortgages higher, keeping would-be buyers at bay. The central bank has now turned more cautious, and analysts expect an easing in mortgage rates since November to coax back nervous purchasers in the crucial spring selling season that begins next month. Yet the long-term prospects for the sector remain more challenging. In addition to interest rates, more structural headwinds — including affordability after the dramatic rise in prices, unexpected demographic changes and the rising cost of construction — have dimmed the outlook for homebuilders.  High prices have deterred younger buyers while older owners are staying in family homes, bucking expectations they will sell up for a smaller place in a warmer climate. “Baby-boomers are working longer and millennials are taking longer to move into a single-family home,” says Susan Maklari, an analyst with Credit Suisse in New York. Meanwhile, last year’s market ructions deterred wealthier buyers with assets tied up in stocks and bonds, she argues. The other end of the spectrum has fared no better. Higher construction costs mean the homebuilders that have cut prices to lure buyers at the low-end of the market will have a hit to their profits. “Ultimately, they’ll have to make some difficult decisions around pricing,” says Michael Dahl, housing analyst for RBC Capital Markets. “You might see more activity come back but it will be at the expense of margins for homebuilders.” Mr Dahl believes the sector’s earnings have peaked, and predicts that valuations will drop again in coming months. The industry itself is also growing more concerned, with homebuilders’ confidence near the lowest levels since May 2015, according to the National Association of Home Builders. The spring selling season — the busiest time of the year for home sales — will be a crucial test that will probably inject volatility to the sector, whether or not sales volumes impress. Meanwhile, there are a few bright spots. Companies specialising in home repairs and remodelling, for example, could gain from still-rising house prices and a dearth of buying activity. Analysts expect owners who enjoyed the twin benefits of low mortgage rates and rapid price growth will refinance their homes to fund improvements. “A lot of people out there will say to themselves ‘we’ll tap into the equity of this home and redo the kitchen or the bathroom’. That’s an alternative to going out and buying that new home,” Ms Maklari says.  However, the broader concern is that the softening housing market and the slide in homebuilders’ stock prices could be a sign of big trouble ahead. The Dow Jones Home Construction index and sales volumes both started to slide in 2005, before actual house prices began to weaken in 2006. A broader economic downturn took hold a year later. The recent housing weakness could be a sign that the US economy is more sensitive to interest rates than previously thought, some analysts say. Such fears come as concerns over a slowdown are already elevated. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the pace of US economic growth will slow a little from 2.9 per cent in 2018 to 2.5 per cent this year, but some investors and analysts fret that the next downturn could be much closer. “Let’s not forget that [former Fed chair Ben] Bernanke said there was no recession coming in 2008,” says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG in New York. “Housing was the canary in the coal mine and it pulled the economy straight down.”","29.01.2019"
"Stocks to watch: Sainsbury’s, Southwest, Lloyds, Intu, HSBC, CVS","Axel Springer’s investment costs may require a guidance reset, says HSBC","Wednesday 15:30 GMT What’s happening ● J Sainsbury was the FTSE 100’s sharpest faller after the Competition and Markets Authority’s provisional report was seen to effectively block the supermarket’s plans to merge with Asda.  The CMA said the proposed merger would risk lessening competition in 629 local areas and argued for a raft of restrictions on any store disposal process, including requiring a single purchaser for the whole fleet and demanding that all for-sale shops were taken exclusively from either the Asda or Sainsbury’s network.  “Even if Sainsbury and Asda could find a way of making the merger work with 300 store disposals, the CMA’s requirements around store disposals would likely form an insurmountable barrier. It is hard to identify many potential buyers of circa 300 Sainsbury or Asda stores — with the possible exception of Amazon. However, Sainsbury and Asda would likely be very wary of facilitating the entry of a potentially significant competitor.”Barclays The news also hit Wm Morrison, which had been widely tipped as the default buyer of stores from any Asda-Sainsbury disposal process. ● Lloyds Banking Group gained after the lender increased its share buyback fund by £750m to £1.75bn and gave a reassuring 2019 outlook, which included bringing forward a cost-cutting target by a year. Fourth-quarter results were mixed, with Lloyds’ underlying earnings beating consensus forecasts but disappointing at the headline level because of payment protection insurance compensation costs. ● Intu Properties dropped after the shopping centre owner cancelled its final dividend to concentrate on debt reduction. Full-year results from Intu showed net asset values down 24 per cent to 312p per share, which was better than a 270p consensus, and there was no update on its search for a new chief executive. “Shares trade on a 57 per cent prospective net asset value discount, but with no income support and a compromised capital structure there remains plenty to be cautious about, especially with respect to the potential impact on retail landlords from the rebasing of retail rents.”Peel Hunt ● Southwest Airlines led US travel stocks sharply lower after warning that it had underestimated the effect on demand from the government shutdown. The airline warned it was expecting a hit to first-quarter revenue of $60m, versus prior guidance of between $10m and $15m. Separately, Goldman Sachs downgraded Southwest to “sell” from “neutral”. It cited worries about a higher level of discounting on the group’s new Hawaii service. ● CVS Health plunged after lowering 2019 expectations. The drugstore operator said earnings this year would be between $6.68 and $6.88 per share, versus a $7.35 consensus, with management explaining the miss by flagging a 10 per cent drop in retail operating profit.    “Despite low expectations coming into the print, the greater headwinds and softer guidance will likely pressure shares, particularly after [a] recent bounce,” said Citigroup. “While the stock remains cheap, the lower EPS guide does little to assuage the ‘value trap’ argument, with upcoming execution and ability to manage headwinds the key to getting the shares to move higher over time.” Sellside stories ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded HSBC to “underweight” from “neutral” with a 620p target on the back of the bank’s full-year results on Tuesday. Among the broker’s concerns was a rise in funding costs as Hibor — a measure of lending costs between banks in Hong Kong — underperforms Libor, the equivalent UK rate.  “Although we rate HSBC’s management highly and view the group on the right strategic path long term, we believe that revenue growth pressures (partly as a result of the changed outlook for US rate hikes, a widening Libor-Hibor gap and macro uncertainty) alongside cost investment needs could weigh on the [return on tangible equity] outlook for longer than we previously thought.”JPMorgan With HSBC unlikely to deliver an 11 per cent return on tangible equity by 2020, its premium valuation of 1.2 times book value looked exposed, JPMorgan said. The broker added that HSBC no longer had a capital surplus, yet investors continued to expect a share buyback this year. HSBC’s dividend of 51 cents should remain stable over the medium term but the yield of 6 per cent might move higher given the uncertainties faced, particularly as peers with growing capital returns offered 5.5 per cent yields on average, it added. ● HSBC downgraded Axel Springer to “hold” from “buy” with a €62 target price. Axel’s 2019 guidance “is likely to be uninspiring” when the German publishing group delivered full-year results due on March 7, it said.  Axel was likely to reset expectations for its classifieds business, which accounted for more than 80 per cent of the group’s enterprise value, HSBC said. Margins were vulnerable because of relatively high fixed costs, so guidance of operating earnings growth in the mid-single digits would “lead to significant consensus estimate cuts”, it said. “Like any other public company, Springer needs to find the right balance between short-term earnings growth and long-term investments. We think its 2019 outlook could tip that balance towards the latter. We don’t want to suggest the lack of margin drop-through is going to be the ‘new normal’ but at the same time we expect this to be the least inspiring guidance for many years.”HSBC ● In brief: ACS cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Bakkafrost cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; BHP cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Credit Suisse upgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; DKSH raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Ipsen upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Marston’s raised to “buy” at Canaccord; McBride cut to “hold” at Peel Hunt; RSA rated new “buy” at Peel Hunt; Sanne raised to “buy” at Liberum; Sartorius downgraded to “neutral” at UBS; Snam cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Tele2 upgraded to “buy” at Société Générale; VolkerWessels raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; XXL upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs.

"Stocks to watch: G4S, Indivior, Reckitt, Stagecoach, Unilever","Boeing’s Max problems leave Ryanair exposed to soaring costs, says Goodbody","Wednesday 14:00 BST What’s happening ● G4S was the FTSE 100’s biggest gainer after Canadian peer GardaWorld confirmed it may bid for the security services group. In response to an Evening Standard report, Garda said it was in the “preliminary stages of considering an approach to the board of G4S regarding a cash offer for the company, or part thereof”.  Analysts said the talks were likely to have stemmed from G4S’s plan to split off its Cash Solutions division, announced in December. “We consider Brink’s and Prosegur Cash to be frontrunners,” said Jefferies. “However, GardaWorld is executing an aggressive roll-up strategy under an extremely ambitious management team and deal size is increasing as they were linked with a $2.0bn-$2.5bn offer for Constellis [formerly known as Blackwater] last year.” Buying the whole of G4S “would be a stretch” because GardaWorld only has annual revenue of around £2bn, compared with G4S’s £7bn of sales, “but they are plausible contenders for Cash Solutions or perhaps a post-transaction G4S”, said Jefferies. ● Indivior plunged to a record low on news that the US Department of Justice had indicted the drugmaker for illicit marketing practices and sought damages in excess of $3bn. A slump of more than 70 per cent wiped nearly £600m off its market value as analysts questioned its ability to avoid bankruptcy.  Reckitt Benckiser, which spun off Indivior in 2014, led the FTSE 100 fallers on worries that it may be liable for at least part of any fine. Reckitt has already booked a $400m provision to cover its liability to Indivior investigations and has cautioned that the eventual cost may be “substantially higher”.   A grand jury in the Western District of Virginia indicted Indivior for “executing an illicit nationwide scheme to increase prescriptions of Suboxone film”, its opioid addiction treatment, since 2010. Indivior had “illegally obtained billions of dollars in revenue from Suboxone film prescriptions by deceiving healthcare providers and healthcare benefit programmes into believing that Suboxone film is safer and less susceptible to diversion and abuse than other, similar drugs”, the grand jury said. 
 Indivior said it would vigorously defend its position in court against the charges, which included conspiracy to commit mail, wire and healthcare fraud. If convicted of one or more of the alleged offences, Indivior would pay a minimum of $3bn, the indictment said.  Such a fine “would require either a major rights issue or could lead the company to bankruptcy”, said Jefferies. “However, in our view the $3bn could be a headline number and a starting point for any further negotiations given Indivior has been in advanced discussions and has already provisioned $438m. We also believe that the DoJ would unlikely wish to be the cause for Indivior to cease operations given its major role in treating the opioid crisis in the US . . .  This is still likely to be a drawn-out process with a court case and appeals, so likely still several years before any potential penalties are paid if found guilty.” Nevertheless, the uncertainty led Stifel to downgrade Indivior from “buy” to “sell” with a target cut from 440p to 10p.  If Reckitt was also given a fine in the region of $3bn it would push group net debt to 3.1 times core earnings, from 2.6 times currently, said Credit Suisse. The broker also worried that the uncertainty may stall Reckitt’s plans to spin off its home care brands.   The news had no effect on Aberdeen Standard Life, Indivior’s largest shareholder, which traded slightly higher. ASL and US-based Scopia Capital Management hold 17.3 per cent and 16 per cent of Indivior shares, respectively. TT International, a London hedge fund founded by former UBS traders including Tim Tacchi, was the only investor to disclose a sizeable short position in Indivior with 1.2 per cent of the stock borrowed. ● Stagecoach slipped to a two-year low after the UK’s Department for Transport disqualified it from all three rail franchise bids for which it had been shortlisted. The DfT said it had made the decision based on risks concerning pension funding over the life of the franchises.  Unless Stagecoach can appeal against the decision the company will close rail operations when its current franchises expire over the next 12 months. Though analysts had already written down most of its rail business — Citigroup had valued it at 12p a share in a 177p group valuation — they said the loss would leave the group reliant on a UK bus business that was sensitive to demand and political pressures. Sellside stories ● Goodbody downgraded Ryanair to “hold” from “buy” with a €12.70 target price, cut from €13.70.  “Lower summer capacity growth forecasts now seem to be more than offset by weakening demand, as seen in easyJet’s recent guidance cut. While Ryanair has always been cautious on summer yields, we expect its commentary on May 20 [full-year results] to be downbeat.”Goodbody The delivery of 47 Boeing 737 Max jets had been expected to help lower Ryanair’s unit costs next year, but with regulators setting stringent conditions to getting the Max back in the air the ex-fuel cost to Ryanair of late delivery would be €10m, Goodbody forecast. The broker also noted that lease costs have risen a third since the grounding of the Max fleet and Ryanair has few planes in reserve.  Rising lease costs, disruption risks and a 6 per cent jump in fuel prices from February suggest Ryanair will deliver profit after tax of €960m, down 16 per cent in two months, Goodbody said. ● Barclays started coverage of Unilever and Lindt & Sprüngli with “underweight” advice in a 311-page note on the European food producers. It preferred Danone and Nestlé, both rated “overweight” in new coverage, along with AB Foods. “The food industry stands at a crossroads where its traditional advantages of scale, big brands and mass marketing have been all but eroded . . . Mass marketing is being replaced with mass personalisation, with fragmentation everywhere. Nimble small brands have been the winners, taking global share from the larger players every year in the last five, because they have grasped the magnitude of the food revolution and how younger consumers’ relationship with food has fundamentally changed . . . Aggressive cost-cutting to drive margins (fuelled by activists and cheap capital) when growth is slowing, has proven to be an unsustainable model as the Kraft Heinz warning proved. There’s no alternative to growth.”Barclays Big brands have been fighting back after “years in the wilderness” by shortening their speed-to-market times and using in-house venture capital funds to buy smaller producers, which should make it harder for the sector to be blindsided again, Barclays said. The next battlegrounds would be food personalisation and precision marketing, its team predicted. Barclays said to sell Unilever “as we worry its margins are looking exposed at a time when its top line and market share gains have slowed and when we see limited ability for transformational change given its [Anglo-Dutch] structure”. On Lindt, the broker liked its premium positioning but worried about US exposure and an “elevated” valuation. Danone “has the healthiest portfolio in global food, and we believe the structural growth of its plant-based portfolio is under-appreciated”, while Danone still has “plenty more runway to unlock value, including potentially monetising its L’Oréal stake and setting new targets beyond 2020”.   ● In brief: Aena raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Alcon rated “overweight” at Morgan Stanley, “hold” at Berenberg and “neutral” at JPMorgan, all in new coverage; Conzzeta rated new “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Epiroc cut to “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley; Evotec downgraded to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; FDM Group cut to “hold” at Stifel; FLSmidth upgraded to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; Glencore downgraded to “sector perform” at RBC; Gooch & Housego raised to “hold” at Stifel; Industrivarden cut to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Novartis cut to “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Qinetiq downgraded to “hold” at Investec; Siemens Gamesa cut to “neutral” at Redburn; Valeo downgraded to “sell” at Citigroup.

"Exertion of force: Goldman Sachs challenged on leverage loan conflicts","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Goldman Sachs has the finest collection of chief executive and board relationships of any company in the world. And its new chief executive David Solomon is keen to monetise all them to the max as the firm’s traditional earnings power in sales and trading wanes. The question now is if the company and its clients understand the risks inherent in expanding those relationships.  Sujeet Indap’s Inside Finance column this week on the litigation between Goldman and US grocery wholesaler United Natural Foods examines the perils when those close CEO relationships get all weird. UNFI used Goldman to help clinch the $3bn buyout of rival Supervalu. Goldman then went out to sell a $2bn leveraged loan to fund the deal. Leveraged loans have become the hottest product on Wall Street in recent years as a recent FT series has explained. And it’s a natural play for Goldman, given its dominance in M&A advisory and its post-crisis status as a bank holding company. But leveraged loans are a trickier business from a risk and conflict perspective than M&A advice. Goldman assumed the risk of offloading the loan to buyside investors and when earnings dipped at both UNFI and Supervalu, investor interest waned. Suddenly, Goldman was adverse to its client. Now UNFI claims it breached its responsibilities to it, accusing Goldman of, among other things, improperly holding on to $40m of loan proceeds and even “manipulating” the credit default swaps markets to place the debt with hedge funds. Goldman strongly denies the allegations, believing this is a straightforward contract dispute. That is, its actions were perfectly consistent with its rights per its legal agreement with UNFI. In that sense, it’s what makes this dispute so interesting. UNFI feels betrayed by Goldman, whom it effectively believed would shield it when the debt markets went south. Its CEO, who knew Goldman well, was caught off guard. The lawyers and the judge will sort out the legal niceties here, but observers point out that companies need to be acutely aware how their bankers’ incentives and roles can quickly change depending on what product they’re selling. Democrats seize role as antitrust warden The list of Democratic senators running for US president (pictured below) is getting longer and more diverse. Some are anti-Wall Street, such as 
Elizabeth Warren, while others are moderate, such as Cory Booker, who are loved by liberal private equity types.  Wherever these Democrats fall on the scale, they all seem to agree on one thing: US antitrust regulators should be tougher on the wave of M&A witnessed in recent years. That view was made loud and clear on Tuesday by nine US senators, including five presidential hopefuls, who urged America’s top antitrust regulators to block T-Mobile’s $60bn takeover of indebted rival Sprint. In a letter to the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, the senators said the merger was “likely to raise prices for consumers, harm workers, stifle competition, exacerbate the digital divide, and undermine innovation”. Their view will matter. Dealmakers are already worried that the political pendulum is swinging too far to the left in reaction to the rightwing nationalist policies of US President Donald Trump. DD would caution those worried bankers and lawyers — the pendulum hasn’t swung too far to the left yet: the Democratic party only controls the House of Representatives. A takeover of Sprint by T-Mobile, if approved by regulators, would leave the US dominated by three major wireless carriers. The two groups have sought to allay antitrust concerns, warning that neither can compete with Verizon or AT&T, the two leading wireless providers in the country, especially as each readies for the arrival of 5G technology.  Executives from T-Mobile and Sprint are due to testify to Congress about the deal on Wednesday and Thursday this week. Kadhim Shubber, the FT’s main antitrust watcher, said that the companies have attempted to assuage concerns about the deal in recent weeks. In a letter to the FCC on February 4, T-Mobile’s chief executive John Legere pledged not to raise prices after the merger was completed. Makan Delrahim, the DoJ’s chief antitrust watchdog, has indicated that he had no fundamental issue with a deal that reduced the number of competitors in a market from four to three. That’s a significant shift from previous administrations. Sprint was forced to abandon its pursuit of T-Mobile in the summer of 2014 after Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive, failed to win over regulators. Separately, AT&T’s attempt to buy T-Mobile for $39bn was blocked in late 2011. As we get closer to the 2020 presidential race, Wall Street should prepare itself for tougher scrutiny when awaiting regulatory approval. If anything, it could be the next pitch to clients as to why they should agree a deal today. Behind the Money: BB&T and SunTrust This week our Behind the Money podcast digs into the first mega-bank merger since the financial crisis. DD readers will remember that BB&T and SunTrust sealed their $66bn merger with a very awkward fist bump. But now that the market has recovered from its shock over the knockout deal, everyone wants to know whether there’s more to come.  The FT’s Rob Armstrong and DD’s James Fontanella-Khan dig into the details of the deal and discuss whether the largest banking transaction in a decade will inspire other executives to take the plunge. Copycat deals are not unfathomable in the Trump era, but we’re unlikely to see the likes of JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America consolidate.

"Moral Money: Bridging the yawning information gap on ESG investing","Introducing your guide to the investment and business revolution you can’t afford to ignore","Welcome to the first Moral Money newsletter! It used to be said that money makes the world go round. But these days, that is only half true. A growing number of financiers, investors and business executives want to do more with their money than just chase returns, so they are embracing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals (or at least they are keen to be seen as doing so).
 Here at Moral Money, we will be breaking news, curating content and providing analysis on this bubbling revolution in our weekly notes to you. Your feedback is critical to our success. Get in touch at moralmoneyreply@ft.com, forward this newsletter to colleagues who you think would find it valuable, and sign up here if you haven’t already.
 Let’s get started . . . 
 What’s $28tn among friends? (Almost) everyone knows that ESG is big these days. But how big? That is a matter of heated debate. This week the Global Impact Investing Network released its latest survey of its 266 members who manage $239bn dedicated to “impact”. These investors report compound annual growth of about 17 per cent and the GIIN reckons that if you include investors outside its network the sector is now worth $500bn — or more. However, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance says impact investing is just one tiny subset of ESG — and says the entire sector now totals $31tn, an $8tn increase since 2016. That sounds eye-poppingly large. However, JPMorgan complains that “ESG surveys in general overstate the ‘true’ ESG investment universe”, which it suggests is “only” $3tn.  A $28tn measurement gap is hefty — even between friends. But irrespective of this, three things are clear. First, the sector is growing rapidly, not just in Europe, but America and Asia.  Second, business and finance is reaching an interesting tipping point: investors and executives now fear that it is more costly and risky to ignore ESG than embrace (at least some of) these ideas. Third, there is a yawning information gap. That is where Moral Money comes in. We will not be preaching about ESG; as journalists our mantra is “illuminate, not advocate”. But we want to highlight what works (and what does not) and spotlight key people and ideas by collating the best existing coverage from the FT, its sister publications and elsewhere in this weekly newsletter and hub page — and supplementing it. So, if you have read this far . . . thank you! Please keep reading! Better still, tip us off with stories, ideas, complaints or anything else at moralmoneyreply@ft.com. Let’s create a new compass in this $31tn (or $3tn?) landscape! Shipping: The next wave in the fight against climate change Which sectors get the worst black marks over carbon emissions? If you were to ask that question to most politicians — or voters — they would probably say cars, coal mines and planes.  Think again. Last year scientists calculated that the shipping industry emits as much carbon as the entire nation of Germany. And though shipping has not been at the forefront of the green finance movement, that is about to change. Almost a dozen global banks, led by Citi, Société Générale and Danske, met in New York this week to sign the so-called “Poseidon Principles”, which effectively ban lending to shipping groups that do not sign up to the International Maritime Organization’s plan to cut carbon emissions in half by 2050. When this target was created, cynics doubted it would have teeth. But the dozen banks signing the Poseidon Principles account for a fifth of the $450bn ship lending market (which, in turn, represents 90 per cent of shipping finance). Thus far the venture has been driven by US and European groups. But the Poseidon Principles organisers are confident that Chinese banks will soon sign up too. If so, the Japanese and Koreans will almost certainly follow. The bottom line? Investors urgently need to wake up to the IMO rules, and the role of green finance. If shipping hits those IMO targets it could have a striking impact on global carbon emissions — and create a new world of winners and losers in green shipping. Oil chiefs commit to carbon pricing after ‘Come to Jesus’ meeting with Pope Francis  For the second year in a row, Pope Francis called together the heads of some of the world’s largest oil and finance companies to urge them to take meaningful action to combat climate change. And this time he got results — at least on paper. After a closed-door meeting at the Vatican last week, nearly 20 chief executives, including the bosses of Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP, signed an agreement to support carbon pricing as a means of keeping global warming below the 2C goal set out in the Paris agreement. The group also agreed to report material information in line with the standards set out by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The leaders of BlackRock, State Street and other big financial groups also attended and signed the agreement. “Undeniably, the Earth is a single system and humanity is a single whole. This requires a new level of cooperative leadership, trust-building, and commitment. We embrace this challenge,” reads the letter signed by the chief executives. The Pope himself had even stronger words about the severity of the situation. Climate change “threatens the very future of the human family”, he said, calling for the world to “avoid perpetrating a brutal act of injustice towards the poor and future generations”. As of now, most of the world’s top 500 companies are on pace to miss the targets outlined in the Paris agreement. It was not all doom and gloom from the pontiff, though. The transition to clean energy could be good for business and be a strong source of new jobs, he said: “There is still hope”. (Vatican News) Chart of the week  Peace sells . . . but who is buying? The answer appears to be “no one”, according to the FT’s newest Investing for Global Impact Report. Clean energy and green tech were far and away the top priority for impact investors this year while world peace-focused investments found few backers. Smart reads Taming the wild west nature of ESG reporting
 Since regulators have been slow to lay out exactly how companies should report on ESG factors, investors have no choice but to hack their way through a thicket of disparate metrics. The European Commission put out new guidelines on sustainable investing this week, but there are still no hard reporting requirements. Groups such as the CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, have made it their mission to standardise ESG reporting, but they can only do so much when companies refuse to play ball. The CDP does not easily take no for an answer, however. This week it enlisted a group of investors with a combined $10tn under management to name and shame companies that will not submit data in accordance with its framework. Holdouts such as Amazon and Chevron insist they are reporting enough on their own, but the CDP says that misses the point. Moral Money’s Billy Nauman has the full story. Moral Money: why investors should pay attention to ESG  Inequality boils over in Switzerland
 Switzerland’s gender pay gap is among the worst in the developed world, according to the International Labour Organization. Women working in finance face an even higher gap than the national average, but UBS and Credit Suisse are not making it easy for them to air their grievances. Both banks told the FT that employees would need to take leave if they wanted to join the nationwide women’s strike that took place last week. (FT) Grit in the oyster Many companies and investors say they try to “do well by doing good”. As a reminder that many continue to fall short, here’s a little grit in the ESG oyster.

 Facebook’s lack of transparency and disregard for user privacy have become so bad that the company has been booted from one of the broadest ESG indices on the market.

 When Japan’s powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry speaks, Japanese companies jump to attention; such has been the agency’s power over the economy in recent years. So everybody inside and outside Japan should pay attention to a startling report that emerged from Meti a couple of weeks ago (albeit hitherto without much acclaim outside Japan). This document, “SDG Management Guide”, warns companies that they need to embrace the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals as fast as they can, or risk facing a backlash from millennials. The reason is that Japan’s millennials are “SDG natives”, says Meti, and millennials will soon be the majority of consumers, shareholders and employees globally. Thus being SDG compliant is not a cost for companies but a necessity, and ignoring these goals is a major “risk” for companies. Meti also has a positive message: if Japanese companies embrace the goals, they will have a new language to communicate with clients on the world stage and a tool to attract more investment. They can also ride the wave of enthusiasm being created around the 2020 Olympics. And Meti thinks Japanese companies may be better placed to embrace the SDGs than companies in other markets because Japanese businesses have had a longstanding tradition of focusing on stakeholders, not just shareholders: since the 17th century, a popular phrase in Osaka has been “three way satisfactions (san pou yoshi)” — meaning companies need to keep buyers, sellers and society happy.

"Huawei: still fighting for survival despite Trump truce","The Chinese telecoms group is determined to accelerate efforts to become self-reliant"," Visitors to the Shenzhen headquarters of Huawei — the Chinese company that has been at the centre of the US-China trade war — are struck by the ubiquity of one photograph. It is displayed on the walls of the reception, in the coffee shop and on cardboard prints handed out by Ren Zhengfei, the company’s founder and chief executive.  The grainy, black-and-white image shows a second world war Soviet plane that has been so badly damaged by enemy fire that it has gaping holes in its wings and body.  “I felt that it was quite like us. We are riddled with bullets from the US,” Mr Ren said. But the former soldier in the People’s Liberation Army is not seeking victim status. His affinity with the photo derives from a different reason; in spite of its shot-up state, the plane did not crash and instead managed to fly home. Huawei is similar, argued the 74-year-old entrepreneur who founded the company with seed capital of just $5,000 in 1987. It will also manage to “fly home” in spite of all the flak hurled at it by the US administration of President Donald Trump. At the weekend, Mr Trump called a partial ceasefire in those hostilities telling the G20 meeting in Osaka that US technology companies — banned from supplying Huawei since May — would be given a qualified go-ahead to restart sales of products “where there is no great national emergency problem”. This could mean they may be able to supply some of the chips, software and other 
components 
critical to the world’s largest telecoms equipment company.  Huawei's CFO, and Ren Zhengfei's daughter, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada last year. © Getty Yet the bruising battle between Huawei and Washington — and the distrust it has created — is expected to further reduce the reliance on US suppliers, which analysts say is already a trend within China’s tech sector. Mr Trump’s weekend comments are unlikely to do much to reverse that, with many in the US believing that his 
move could undermine national security.  “The US is helping us in a great way by giving us these difficulties. Under external pressure, we have become more united than ever, ” Mr Ren said in an interview 
before the dramatic weekend U-turn. “If we aren’t allowed to use US components, we are very confident in our ability to use components made in China and other countries.” In an 80-minute discussion in a cavernous hall adorned by doric pillars and statues of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, Mr Ren touched on a wide range of topics. He spoke of Huawei’s links to China’s military, allegations that his company has used its networks to engage in espionage and charges that it violated US sanctions by dealing with Iran.  He was more reticent on the detention of his daughter Meng Wanzhou in Canada. And a question on whether he would answer a phone call from Mr Trump — were it to come — led to a flurry of evasive manoeuvres.  Mr Trump, he was sure, was “very busy” and “I don’t understand English”. Yes, he supposed, interpreters could be found but they “don’t know much about politics, while I specialise in electronics”. Another issue, he said, was that Mr Trump was “somebody and I am nobody really”. Pressed further, he said that in any case, “I am busy patching up holes [in Huawei’s business] and may not have time to talk”. Presidents Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping called a partial ceasefire at the G20 meeting in Osaka © Reuters In spite of such reticence it is clear that Mr Trump, more than anyone else, holds Huawei’s immediate future in his hands. This reality was underscored when the US president signalled a potential softening of the ban on American companies selling to Huawei.
 The blacklisting imposed in May by Washington represented a body blow to China’s most prominent technology company. It meant that about 1,200 US suppliers of components and intellectual property to Huawei and its 68 affiliates would have to stop such sales — along with overseas firms that shipped items containing more than 25 per cent US-made content.  Huawei bought $11bn in components and services from US suppliers last year out of a total procurement bill of $70bn. Yet in technology terms the disruption would be even greater. As Mr Ren said, if even one out of a thousand key parts is missing, a piece of telecoms equipment will cease to work. As a result Mr Trump’s comments at the G20 were welcome. In an emailed response Mr Ren told the Financial Times: “President Trump’s statements are good for American companies. Huawei is also willing to continue to buy products from American companies. But we don’t see much impact on what we are currently doing. We will still focus on doing our own job right.” It is this phrase — “doing our own job right” — that is key, analysts say. They believe it amounts to Huawei swapping out reliance on US-made inputs as fast as possible. “President Trump’s softening stance on Huawei is an important lifeline for the company,” says Dan Wang, technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. “Nonetheless, Huawei will try to design out US components and continue to build its own capabilities. It can’t allow its survival to be contingent on US political actions.”  Reducing reliance on the US was a theme Mr Ren returned to repeatedly during the interview. He spoke with the urgency of a man who, at that time, risked losing his company once several months of inventory ran out.  “We are looking for alternatives [to US-made technology],” he said. “We are developing our own components and we have strong expertise in doing so, which will enable us to survive.” He ticked off a list of areas most vulnerable to disruption from a rupture in the 
US supply chain and then detailed where he thought Huawei stood in terms of being able 
to replace or develop its own components, service and intellectual property to plug any gap. 
 Mr Trump shared news of the truce agreed at the G20 with his followers on twitter  “We don’t have too many problems with chips, as we can create most of what we need,” he said. “We don’t have big problems with our hardware. But there is some impact on our software systems.” Independent analysts had a less optimistic view. Huawei’s Achilles heel is in chips, according to Credit Suisse, including radiofrequency varieties used to broadcast mobile signals for phones; and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), critical to telecoms equipment such as 5G base stations. Both areas are dominated by US suppliers for which there are no obvious alternatives who manufacture on a similar scale. Software is another key vulnerability. Two-thirds of the cyber security software tools used in Huawei products come from US suppliers, according to executives at the Chinese group, who declined to be identified. Nevertheless, Mr Ren appeared confident that solutions could be found. “Even if the [US] continues to cut off our supply of these things,” he said, “we will be able to get the ‘holes’ fixed and catch up.” Another weakness is the reliance of Huawei’s smartphones on Google’s Android operating system. As a replacement, Mr Ren talks about repurposing a homegrown operating system, called Hongmeng, to install in its mobile phones and support an ecosystem of apps.  A Kunpeng 920 chip is unveiled in Shenzhen in January. The company plans to expand into emerging markets despite western warnings the company might be a security risk © AP This process of localisation and substitution that Mr Ren describes goes far beyond Huawei alone. “Made in China 2025”, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping, was launched in 2015 with the aim of making China a technological superpower. It envisages global leadership in 10 core sectors including “new-generation information technology”. Made in China’s goals of achieving high levels of “self-sufficiency” in such industries — by substituting foreign technology with domestically-developed alternatives — have made the blueprint 
deeply unpopular in the US and Europe. In recent years, China’s state media has downplayed the programme, but Huawei’s strategies now chime with Beijing’s industrial policy. Strains of techno-nationalism run through China’s industry and are by no means limited to state-owned companies. Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of tech giant Alibaba, last year warned against US dominance in semiconductors, fretting over the vulnerabilities that countries could suffer if US manufacturers restricted supply. “If we do not master the core technologies, we will be building roofs on other people’s walls and planting vegetables in other people’s yards,” Mr Ma said.
  Mr Ren does not come across as a nationalist. His eclectic international taste is on show not only in the decor of his company headquarters but also in the vast new faux-European campus he has built in Dongguan, a city in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.  To a European, the architecture in the campus feels surreal. A replica of Heidelberg Castle in Germany is home to the Huawei research unit and there are 12 imitation European towns — with buildings reminiscent of Oxford, Paris, Verona, Bruges and others — dotted across parkland connected by a funicular railway reserved for employees. Perhaps such internationalist credentials help Huawei — which employs over 188,000 people in 170 countries — live up to its global ambitions of conquering the market for 5G, a new generation of superfast services that promises to usher in the “internet of things”.  Huawei’s headquarters in Dongguan occupies a faux-European campus including a replica of Germany's Heidelberg Castle  So far, it has won 50 contracts for 5G outside China and shipped 150,000 5G base stations, according to executives. Asked how many countries around the world he expects to adopt Huawei’s 5G equipment, Mr Ren said: “About 135 to 136 countries. The US and Australia won’t choose us. Most European customers will.” In some countries, such as the UK, winning acceptance has been an uphill struggle. Suspicions over whether Huawei may have installed “backdoors” in its systems — through which it might eavesdrop on sensitive communications — have pulled the company into an expensive official review. The UK is also reviewing the source code that underpins Huawei’s systems to ensure it is safe, having found “vulnerabilities”. “The UK is not rejecting us; it’s telling us that our systems have vulnerabilities,” he said. “We are both working to ensure security.” In Europe, the road to acceptance appears equally tortuous. The General Data Protection Regulation, the EU-wide data privacy regime, has obliged Huawei to overhaul its systems. “This will require us to redevelop networks,” Mr Ren said. “It will take about five years to re-architect all products, which means a lot of effort across the company.” A Huawei surveillance camera  © Reuters Meanwhile, the company continues to fight a rearguard action against longstanding suspicions that swirl around its links to China’s security state. Mr Ren said his own military background proves nothing: “It’s true that I was once a soldier, but that does not mean that Huawei has ties to the military.” With so many diverse pressures, Mr Ren might be expected to welcome efforts by large US semiconductor companies that are understood to be lobbying in Washington to resume sales to the Chinese company. But his response to this is brusque.  “We don’t know what they are doing,” Mr Ren said. “We have switched from seeking development to fighting for our survival. We are trying to gather together scientists to make the most advanced future technologies, so that we can [just] fight back.” Huawei: Ren Zhengfei defiant in face of hostile US actionsSubtitles unavailable  Governments ask Huawei: ‘Is it safe?’ For many of the 140 countries Huawei sells telecoms equipment to, the question is not whether to allow the Chinese group into their networks or not, but how to assess and mitigate risk. Although the US has been pressing its military allies to bar Huawei from their 5G networks, a number of European governments are still weighing their options and have begun security reviews. The UK has the strongest security assessment process for Huawei. In 2010, the company set up the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre under the watchful eye of the UK’s GCHQ intelligence agency, following growing concerns over the threats posed by security flaws in critical infrastructure. The HCSEC tests whether Huawei equipment can be broken into, and reviews the source code behind its software. And while it has not found evidence of backdoors built into Huawei’s software that could allow Beijing to monitor users’ communications, it has found a string of mundane but serious vulnerabilities that could allow hackers, either state-backed or commercial, to access global telecoms networks. HCSEC’s latest report in March warned that it could only provide “limited assurance” that risks to national security had been mitigated, criticising Huawei for failing to improve its cyber security practices. The main reason behind the “limited assurance” is that HCSEC still needs proof that the source code Huawei is providing for inspection matches the code used in the UK.   Huawei argues that the UK’s review process is the toughest of any in the world and its competitors have not faced similar levels of scrutiny. But security experts say that the UK’s model is far from foolproof, because Huawei rolls out software updates which are not screened by the HCSEC. 
 The difficulty of verifying Huawei’s security highlights a problem facing all governments’ ability to screen their equipment providers. Trust and geopolitics, not just technical reviews,  play a large part.  “We’re between a rock and a hard place between China and the US

,” John Suffolk, Huawei’s global cyber security officer, told the FT earlier this year, “but that’s the realpolitik of the situation, and there’s nothing that we can do about that”.","03.07.2019"
"Aurelius court victory sends Windstream to Chapter 11","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One thing to start: One of the biggest pharma deals in history — with a mouthwatering $1bn payday for Wall Street at stake — is in trouble. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s largest institutional investor has said it will not back the company’s $90bn takeover of Celgene. Cue the fire drills at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, the lead advisers. Now back to the show . . . Well that escalated quickly. In less than two weeks, Arkansas-based telecoms group Windstream has gone from losing a bruising legal battle with New York hedge fund Aurelius Capital Management to filing for bankruptcy. Highly indebted companies fall into bankruptcy all the time. But the reason the Windstream case has raised eyebrows even in the stone-faced world of Wall Street, is because it has shown just how easily aggressive hedge funds can hasten a company’s demise. Aurelius had bought about $300m of Windstream’s bonds, giving it a strong bargaining position to push through its case that a 2015 sale-leaseback transaction had violated the terms of the company’s debt. But it is believed to have pushed so hard because it had made a side-bet in credit derivatives, which could hand it huge profits, were the company to default.   
  To say there’s no love lost between the company and its pursuer is an understatement. When filing for bankruptcy, Windstream’s chief executive Tony Thomas accused Aurelius of “predatory market manipulation” around its CDS bet. Aurelius has since dismissed the accusation as “nonsense”, brushing off the executive’s claim as “whining”. Aurelius’s founder Mark Brodsky is no stranger to putting noses out of joint. A lawyer-turned-distressed debt investor made his name in the 1990s at Elliott Management, when the New York hedge fund partnered with Aurelius in a decade-long tussle with Argentina over its defaulted debt. But it isn’t just Windstream’s management that Brodsky is aggravating. The other big losers in Windstream are heavy-hitting hedge funds, including his former employer. Elliott not only holds a position in Windstream’s battered bonds, but it is the telecom company’s fourth-largest shareholder and the third-largest holder of its listed spin-off, Uniti. Windstream’s shares have crashed more than 85 per cent during the chaos of the past couple of weeks, while Uniti’s have halved.   
  While no fund has stepped up to voice their frustration in public at Aurelius’s hardball tactics, there’s been a lot of heavy hinting. John Bringardner from Debtwire described Aurelius as the “Voldemort” of this week’s bankruptcy hearing: the fund everyone was talking about but nobody would name. A lawyer representing one group of creditors all but named Aurelius, for example, when he argued that a fund that had bet aggressively on Windstream’s demise using CDS shouldn’t get equal representation in a bankruptcy. “It’s one thing to buy insurance on my neighbour’s house, it’s another to burn it down, it’s a third thing to collect money on insurance and another thing to be welcomed at my neighbour’s table.” This analogy of home insurance against fire is also one that respected academic Henry Hu used this week, when the foremost expert on CDS wrote an FT op-ed arguing for the reform of the credit derivatives market. One underdiscussed aspect of the tale, however, is why Windstream was so rife for CDS shenanigans in the first place. And the answer lies in one of the weapons of financial mass destruction that many thought died in the crisis: the synthetic CDO. In 2017, Alastair Marsh at Bloomberg did an excellent deep dive into how Windstream’s CDS was being packaged into $3.5bn of such collateralised-debt obligations, the market for which had miraculously rebounded due to investors’ desperate hunt for yield. The demand from these CDOs skewed the price, making Windstream CDS incredibly cheap to buy and, therefore, the perfect playing field for an aggressive scheme. While DD readers are welcome to disagree, we think that the financialisation process may have gone a bit too far when credit-default swaps packaged into CDOs eventually help hasten the downfall of an actual business. The fight for Newmont Mining is starting to get ugly Barrick Gold’s bold $18bn hostile bid for Newmont Mining, the only gold miner in the S&P 500, has already degenerated into a war of words. Gary Goldberg, the chief executive of Newmont, has dismissed Barrick’s macho big-game hunting chief executive Mark Bristow as an executive who has only run operations in Africa, lacking the experience of managing a global mining company. Since the two companies last tried to merge in 2014, Newmont’s shares have risen by 65 per cent while Barrick’s have fallen 22 per cent — a fact that Goldberg is only too keen to point out. “The current Barrick management team has only been together for eight weeks and has never collectively managed a global portfolio of our scale, complexity or quality,” he said this week.   Shareholders have now started to weigh in.   
  New York-based Coast Capital, which is a small shareholder in Newmont, has written a letter to other investors urging them to reject the deal, which it attacked as “poorly conceived and extraordinarily aggressive”. “[The] synergies claimed by Bristow are taken as fact by investors and observers — but given the fact that most mergers fail to realise any synergies, we are well advised to have very tempered expectations,” the letter states. “Indeed, if Barrick has 100 per cent confidence in these claimed synergies, why not pay 50 per cent of them at least to Newmont to secure the deal?” Coast Capital said Bristow, who was previously chief executive of Africa-focused gold miner Randgold Resources, doesn’t have a record of managing a company of this size with far-flung operations. In addition, photos of Bristow hunting big game in Africa wouldn’t go down well with investors in North America, Coast Capital said. “I would rather not spend time in a room with someone who thinks that killing defenceless animals is what one should do with one’s life,” James Rasteh, partner at Coast Capital, said. Still, the success of Barrick’s bid will be determined by a small group of investors who own shares in both companies. These include Flossbach von Storch and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Flossbach von Storch, a German asset manager that’s a top-five investor in both gold miners with holdings worth more than $1bn, said the idea of combining the best assets in the industry was attractive, if they could be integrated seamlessly. “We like the approach and the optionality that comes with the Barrick merger proposal but — and this is the important thing — it has to be seamless and not too hostile,” said Simon Jäger, a portfolio manager. “Both parties need to want this deal.” Iliad’s odyssey tests investor patience Investors are losing patience with French telecoms operator Iliad. In fact, two Iliad shareholders are so frustrated with founder Xavier Niel’s belated efforts to recover his mojo that they draw parallels with Samuel Beckett’s French play Waiting for Godot, in which two protagonists wait for someone called Godot who never comes. Last week Iliad’s share price hit an eight-year low. Its market value has more than halved since its May 2017 peak, wiping billions off the net worth of its majority shareholder Niel, one of the country’s richest men and the so-called enfant terrible of French telecoms.   
  DD’s Harriet Agnew in Paris writes that Iliad has made investors wait on three fronts: for consolidation to happen in France, for cash flow to materialise, and for its commercial strategy to bear fruit. Like its French rivals Orange, Altice’s SFR, and Bouygues, Iliad has periodically stoked investors’ hopes for deals — namely that four players would go back down to three — ending a brutal price war. Yet with several failed merger attempts in the past five years, shareholders aren’t holding their breath. It’s still uncertain whether any possible combination would be able to surmount the egos of the billionaire backers at three out of the four operators, and the scrutiny of the regulator.

"Leaving London: voices from the financial front lines of Brexit","The Financial Times talks to people involved in moves from the City of London to rival EU cities","In the 33 months since the UK voted to leave the EU, thousands of financial services companies with European hubs in London have been assessing their options.  Many of them have concluded that the potential disruption of Brexit means they need to expand elsewhere in the EU, anticipating the loss of passporting rights that permit them to access clients across Europe. Financial Times research published last week found that the City of London’s biggest international banks have moved fewer than 1,500 jobs from the UK in the run-up to Brexit, far fewer than originally estimated in many quarters. While relatively few people have shifted so far, rivals to London’s crown as Europe’s financial centre have been jostling to attract more Brexit escapers. Yet even the current trickle of new arrivals is stirring concern about upward pressure on property prices and extra competition for places at international schools. The FT has spoken to people in six of the cities affected by these moves — Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Milan and Madrid — to hear how Brexit is playing out.  Paris © Alamy  Stefano Petricca remembers where he was when he realised that his fledgling London-based asset manager would have to pack its bags and head to the continent.  “I was watching the referendum on local TV . . . I immediately understood that it was going the wrong way, immediately,” Mr Petricca said in an interview with the Financial Times in Paris while setting up his new life. The 53-year-old Italian native is the founder and chief executive of Petricca & Co Capital, a €700m asset manager, which he set up in London four years ago. 
 To guard against the potential disruption of Brexit, he started planning a move to the continent as soon as the referendum result landed. He fired a handful of staff and uprooted his life, writing off the cost of obtaining UK licences. He chose Paris because of its top cultural attractions, as well as its established financial market infrastructure and its close travel links to London. His move to the French capital has been mirrored at larger banks and asset managers, with Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and a host of others shifting operations there. They were lured to Paris in part by a low-tax offer made by French President Emmanuel Macron.  I had to start to prepare lawyers and accountants to move one year agoStefano Petricca, founder of Petricca & Co Capital “We have seen an acceleration of teams being moved to Paris . . . there is still uncertainty and people are still waiting, but the plans are there and the first teams have been put in place,” said Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, a French business lobby group that estimates some 20,000 jobs are shifting there from London. The moves are pushing up property prices and fuelling competition for scarce places at the city’s best international schools. “We were able to increase the number of school places in Paris by 1,000 to close to 11,500,” said Charline Avenel, who administers four major school districts around Paris, including Versailles.  “The planning began two years ago, after the referendum,” said Ms Avenel, pointing to a new school with an international section opening at Courbevoie near the business district of La Défense that has guaranteed school places to the European Banking Authority’s staff as it moves from London to Paris. Prime office space in the centre of Paris is also already scarce, with Brexit only adding to the pressure. “In the most sought after areas of Paris the vacancy rates are at a record low of 1.7 per cent,” said Philippe Perello, a Paris partner with Knight Frank. 
 The same is true for high-end apartments. “There is a scarcity in the market . . . in the classic arrondissements, like the 16th, with a good stock of Haussmannian apartments, some with gardens, and close to the good schools, prices have jumped by over 5 per cent since Brexit,” said Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, who works at Belles Demeures de France specialising in luxury real estate. She has been inundated recently with requests from bankers moving from London to Paris. Mr Petricca is himself searching for an apartment in Paris and although he “prays for a second referendum” his own move is now set in stone. “You know why; because I had to start to prepare lawyers and accountants to move one year ago.” David Keohane in Paris
 Frankfurt © Alamy  In the coffee shops and bars of Frankfurt’s financial district that surrounds the city’s old opera house, talk of Brexit has been drowned out by a different, yet equally contested topic: the merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. Both banks have their headquarters in the German city, and they are expected to sack tens of thousands of employees if the deal goes ahead. In the long run, Brexit is likely to impact Frankfurt more fundamentally than Deutsche’s potential absorption of Commerzbank. But for now, little has changed in the sleepy city of 730,000 people. Since the Brexit vote in 2016, more than 45 financial institutions have set up or beefed up their presence in Germany, the vast majority of them choosing Frankfurt — including the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Standard Chartered. “Frankfurt is the first choice for Brexit banks,” said Gertrud Traud, chief economist of Frankfurt based Helaba, a state-owned bank that is tracking the process closely. The total assets banks hold in the city is expected to rise by more than a fifth this year as they relocate several hundreds of billions of euros from London. The clearing volume of euro-denominated derivatives such as interest rate swaps — close to zero when Britain voted to leave the EU — jumped more than tenfold last year alone. For now lenders are only moving “the bare minimum” of jobs from London to Frankfurt that they need to satisfy regulators, said Joachim Wuermeling, a Bundesbank board member. “There will be a second wave, but at the moment it is very difficult to assess how big it will be.” Most banks have been hiring locally for any extra jobs in Frankfurt.
 “We have a number of employees ready to move instantly in a hard Brexit situation, but so far almost no one has made the plunge,” said a Frankfurt-based employee at a large US investment bank. Germany’s financial capital, which lack’s London’s global buzz or Paris’ cultural flair, has done little to woo banks. Mayor Peter Feldmann, a left-of-centre Social Democrat, avoids the sector. The federal government in Berlin has, however, promised to make it easier for banks to fire highly paid senior staff.  While partly driven by Brexit, the boom in Frankfurt’s commercial and residential real estate market is mainly caused by low interest rates and a strong local economy outside of banking. 
 Residential rents are up 58 per cent since 2014, and commercial rents for premium office space in prime locations were up 7.3 per cent last year alone, according to BNP Paribas Real Estate.  Expectations of tens of thousands of extra finance jobs have been scaled back. Helaba’s latest estimate is that by the end of next year, Brexit will have pushed the staff employed by foreign banks up by 2,000 to about 4,500.

 Dublin © Bloomberg  Dublin was in the grip of acute financial crisis when Barry Mangan left the Irish capital for London a decade ago. By the time the JPMorgan Chase executive returned last year, the Irish capital was booming again and set for an influx of Brexit bankers.  Mr Mangan, who is in his mid-30s, is chief risk officer at JPMorgan’s payments unit in Dublin’s docklands financial centre. His own move was not directly linked to Brexit. But it came as concern grew that an influx of bankers would squeeze property and school spaces.  Data from IDA Ireland, the state investment agency, suggest Brexit-related projects will create more than 5,000 jobs in an already accelerating economy.  Although Mr Mangan had heard “horror stories” about Dublin’s hot housing market, he and his wife managed to buy a home after six months. “It took some time but nothing crazy,” he said. 
 Dozens of companies have made Dublin their EU hub as the UK prepares to leave the bloc, and this shows no sign of slowing down.  EY, the accountancy firm, reported that 28 financial services groups have committed to relocate staff or operations to Dublin since the 2016 referendum. Among them are Citigroup, Bank of America, Barclays, Legal & General and Axa. 
 More than 100 companies have sought Central Bank of Ireland authorisation to operate in the country and IDA Ireland said 70 new investments are linked directly to Brexit, many outside the financial sector.  Yet John McCartney, research director with estate agents Savills Ireland, said many companies are setting up in Dublin with only small teams. “
They’re finding out about the city, seeing how the land lies . . . If the need arises they will be in a position to scale up,” he said. William Tighe, director with Dwellworks, a specialist international relocation agency, reported a “sustained uplift” in business because of Brexit, adding that the rise in “actionable relocations” has been in the thousands. 
 Places are scarce in Irish state schools, leaving many people to turn to fee-paying institutions. “We’re seeing more placements into private schools and the international schools as a result of these transferees coming in,” Mr Tighe said.  Rents are expensive, with prices in the swishest Dublin suburbs on a par with London or Paris. But the surging house price inflation that took hold after the crash has eased. Residential prices rose 5.6 per cent in the year to January, slowing from 11.8 per cent in the previous 12 months. 
 Mr Mangan is glad to be back in Dublin, saying non-Irish colleagues who have moved there are “generally very pleasantly surprised” at “how vibrant it is and how lively it is”. Arthur Beesley in Dublin
 Amsterdam © Reuters  For Harm Bots, the new head of Royal Bank of Scotland’s expanded Amsterdam office, one of the best things about the Dutch city is its proximity to London. “I can get up in Amsterdam and catch the 7 o’clock flight to London City and still be in the office by 8am, sometimes beating my colleagues who are commuting in London,” said Mr Bots, who recently returned to the city he left 14 years ago after stints in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and London. Mr Bots, who is running RBS’s Dutch subsidiary NatWest Markets NV, is among the hundreds of bankers leaving the UK to work for new European entities, which have been set up so banks can continue servicing clients across the region after Brexit.  Many of those quitting the UK in the first wave of departures are like Mr Bots: foreign nationals from Europe returning to their native country.  The RBS executive, who lived in London for seven years until November, said he will miss its world-class culture. 
“I love London. It’s a fast city, and when I think about the events and exhibitions it’s great,” he said. “But the good news is I’m still often there. And the family can go back to see friends.” Amsterdam’s enviable location and conveniently positioned international airport — seven minutes by train from the financial centre — are among its main selling points, making it well connect to other financial hubs such as Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris. Despite its benefits, including the fact that English is widely spoken, Amsterdam is unlikely to become a hub for investment banking. One factor holding it back is the rule capping bankers’ bonuses at 20 per cent of fixed salary — in effect a tenth of what others earn elsewhere in the EU.  Nonetheless, several trading groups — including CBOE Europe and the London Stock Exchange’s Turquoise platform — have picked Amsterdam as their post-Brexit hub, as has Japanese bank MUFG.  Their expansion threatens to stoke inflation in already surging property prices. In 2017, the city was added to the UBS global real estate bubble index, and now ranks seventh after London and New York on the ratio of average property prices to income.  The Municipality of Amsterdam has responded by proposing a ban on new-build properties financed with buy-to-let mortgages, targeting landlords seeking to rent out apartments on sites such as Airbnb. But the measure also threatens to limit the supply of housing for workers moving to Amsterdam.  “The city is relatively full, there’s talk of a tourist tax,” said Clifford Abrahams, chief financial officer of ABN Amro. “
The housing market is already strained and people are worried about their kids getting on the housing ladder,” he added. David Crow in London
 Milan © Alamy  Davide Serra, founder of a fast-growing $12bn investment company in London, is one of the most high-profile repatriates to Milan since the UK voted to leave the EU.  The 48-year-old left Milan at the age of 22 after winning a place on Warburg’s UK graduate trainee scheme and he never looked back. That is, until Brexit happened. “I have contingency plans,” said Mr Serra. “I can move anyone into any major jurisdiction, depending on what Brexit turns out to be. I am hoping for the best but prepared for the worst.” He said his decision to move with his wife and their four children to Milan from London was a personal one. For now, his Algebris business, which specialises in banking investments and makes a third of sales from Italian clients remains anchored in London with offices in New York, Milan, Luxembourg and Singapore.  Hefty tax breaks offered by the former Renzi government, of which Mr Serra was an outspoken financial supporter, have lured many Italian financiers back from London. Mr Serra said a tax break was not his primary motivation. Instead, he was worried that he and his wife with their British passports and their UK-born and English-speaking children could both find themselves “cut off” from Britain and “find it harder to work across Europe in the future” because of Brexit.  “I want to make sure my kids are fully bicultural and not just bilingual,” he said. “London is the best city in the world — I am convinced London will prevail and London will fight back — but I also realised London is not going to be what is used to be.” Italy has changed since he left. “Milan has become the true Italian capital,” he said. The “grey, dark, dirty and dangerous” northern city he recalls has been transformed since hosting the World’s Fair in 2015.  Qatari and Chinese money has poured into property developments, tourist numbers are higher than in Rome, new international schools have opened luring UK teachers with higher euro-denominated salaries. Crucially, it has also become the “gateway city” for Italy’s export-driven economy to access Europe and the world. Mr Serra said this brings two advantages: “At an entrepreneurial level I get more contact with the real economy than I had in London, and there’s also a growing international Italian community who felt ill at ease with the Brexiters and have come to Milan.” All in all, the move back “has been very pleasant,” he said. Still, he has not turned his back on the UK. Last year, he set up a Policy and Research Forum, signing up German former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, Denmark’s former prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Mr Renzi to debate and promote the values of the EU. The first two debates were in Milan and London. Rachel Sanderson in Milan
 Madrid © Alamy  Sebastián Albella, head of Spain’s securities regulator, has a number of theories why the trickle of post-Brexit bankers moving to Madrid has been below expectations. He blamed a sense of instability caused by the conflict in Catalonia and a lack of tax breaks for companies like those other countries have used to attract international banks looking to set up new EU hubs. Still, he said that “the game is not over yet”, pointing to the arrival of bankers from Credit Suisse and a number of smaller institutions. Madrid will be home to some of the 250 employees Credit Suisse is expected to move out of London, as the Swiss bank establishes an investment banking hub paired with its other main continental European base in Frankfurt. Matthew Taylor, headmaster of King’s College in Madrid, said the English-language school is seeing many more enquiries “most notably since Christmas” from people with finance backgrounds engaging in contingency planning. He said more banks and multinationals are also asking if the school has space for students.  The impact has so far been limited, however, with only about 10 new students relocating from the UK for Brexit-related reasons. “There’s an equally large, if not greater, interest from people relocating from Venezuela,” he added.  Those who do move to Madrid will find a real estate market in full upswing, with prices higher than when the bubble popped during the 2008 financial crisis. Sale prices rose 17.2 per cent in Madrid in the year to January, according to Beatriz Toribio, head of research at real estate portal Fotocasa.  “We are seeing annual increases above 15 per cent in the central and prime districts and we’ve seen them since the end of 2017,” she said. “Madrid is going at a very high speed both in rental and in sale prices.” Prices rose in rich as well as poor areas, with apartment sale prices jumping 13.4 per cent in well-heeled Salamanca and climbing more than 10 per cent in the nearby suburbs of Las Rozas and Majadahonda. Housing sales to British buyers slumped in 2017, the year after the Brexit vote, but rebounded in 2018 as the exit date grew closer. British buyers accounted for 10,722 transactions in 2018, or almost 15 per cent of sales to foreign buyers, the largest market share.  While most were for second homes, some 2,500 were to people moving to Spain for work reasons, said Patricio Palomar Murillo, head of alternative investments at AIRE Partners. “What we’re primarily seeing is the arrival of executives, not that of less-qualified people who need to establish themselves,” Mr Palomar said.

"Stakes are high for Macau casino groups as Sino-US risks lurk","Geopolitical threats mount in the world’s biggest gambling centre","2019 is the year of the pig, according to the Chinese calendar. It is also the year that marks the 20th anniversary of the return of the former Portuguese colony of Macau to the motherland of mainland China. Those reasons — superstitious and sentimental — are on a list put out by Credit Suisse, in an attempt to justify a bullish stance on casino firms operating in Macau, the world’s biggest gambling centre, after a very rocky year. In 2018 the Bloomberg Macau China Gaming index fell by more than a quarter, under-performing the Hang Seng stock index as a whole, reflecting a year of macro pressures as high rollers from the Chinese mainland cut back on spending and borrowing. That means that this year is beginning on a note of low expectations and undemanding valuations. Still, there are lingering risks — not all of them economic — as China gets ready to celebrate the lunar new year and its reunion with Macau. Perhaps the biggest is the risk that casino companies in Macau will join the growing numbers of firms becoming hostage to Sino-US tensions, whatever happens this week.  Such geopolitical fears eclipse economic dangers such as slower growth, a squeeze on shadow banking and a possible plunge in the value of the currency (such as happened three years ago), triggering huge capital flight. Today three of the six major Macau casino firms are either wholly or partly owned by American interests, including Sands China, Wynn Macau and MGM China (the last a joint venture with Pansy Ho, whose father Stanley was a towering presence on the casino scene before his retirement several years ago).   All hold concessions from the government for the privilege of operating casinos, which is separate from running the hotels that house them. Sands could be especially vulnerable, in that context, as it is owned by Sheldon Adelson, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. The MGM concession (along with that of Hong Kong-owned SJM Holdings) is the first to come up for renewal, in March of next year. “Concession renewals remain at the forefront of investors’ minds as we approach the expiry date without any clarity,” noted analysts at the CLSA unit of Beijing-based Citic Securities, in a relatively cautious piece of research published this month. “We cannot rule out Macau getting caught up in the crossfire of US-Sino trade tensions and the fact remains if a more punitive approach were to be levied on either the three American operators, or even all six operators, Macau would be the biggest loser.” Even if Beijing were reluctant to tear up concessions before they expire, at a time when it is eager to attract more foreign investment, there are other measures the government could adopt, such as levying higher taxes on foreign-owned casinos. The American operators are also at risk of broader nationalistic effects, which are hard to quantify. For example, when Apple’s sales began to soften in China two years ago, it was because some of the early, price-insensitive adopters decided Huawei phones were superior, thanks to their dual sim cards and nicer cameras.  Today, though, many consumers are boycotting Apple out of outrage at the way local brands such as Huawei have been treated beyond their borders. Another example is Chinese tourists staying away from South Korea when Seoul imported an anti-missile system from the US that could be directed towards the mainland. “Obviously a beautiful casino hotel without the right to operate a casino inside is not what these operators have in mind,” said one Hong Kong-based hedge fund founder who remained bullish on the sector. “It would be like nationalising $10 to $15bn in hard assets. You can’t revoke a land lease and renege without serious thought.” This investor also notes that Sands and Wynn employ 30,000 workers, combined, in Macau. “It would be a ‘gulp’ moment if you tell Wynn to leave town and turn the building over to some cut-throat local junket operator or [state-owned enterprise] which cuts health insurance, hires all their relatives as management and skips the fire safety checks to save a few nickels,” he added. Still, such an outcome is not completely off the table. Beijing has long been uneasy about Macau given its history as a destination for those who want to get money out of the mainland, evading capital controls. Gambling (as well as online gaming) also has its detractors within government, who see the activity as socially unproductive and fiscally regressive. People born in the year of the pig tend to be wealthy but lose their tempers easily, according to lore. Given all the headwinds in Macau, prudent investors should bear that in mind as they look out over 2019. henny.sender@ft.com

"A five decades-old basin proves ripe for fresh PE capital","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. When oil prices collapsed in 2014, the flow of money into energy projects in the North Sea dried up. Investments dropped to less than £500m in both 2016 and 2017, after reaching as much as £17bn in 2011. Companies, after all, were less keen to invest in new projects after their potential returns had just been marked down significantly.  But others have seen it as an opportunity to strike. In November 2016, Siccar Point Energy — backed by Blackstone and Blue Water Energy — purchased the North Sea assets of Austria’s OMV for $1bn. It marked a turning point for the region’s fortunes. Over the past two years a number of new companies have burst on to the scene and are shaking up the industry. Many are backed by deep-pocketed private equity firms, which are sitting on record sums of dry powder. So far, more than $12bn of private equity money has been pumped into offshore oil and gas assets in the UK North Sea that had gone unloved by the oil majors. The North Sea is fertile ground for private equity-owned companies. With assets on the block from the likes of US majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips, another $13bn of private equity money is expected to be pumped into the industry this year.   One of the biggest factors behind the sea change? Regulatory changes that allow buyers to offset future decommissioning costs with tax relief. Read more from the FT’s Nathalie Thomas and David Sheppard here. And for more, check out the recent FT profile of Jim Ratcliffe, one of the biggest players changing the face of the North Sea. The chemicals tycoon and Brexit supporter was in the news earlier this week for calling the EU’s green taxes “foolish”. Make way for the next generation of Bollorés Billionaire industrialist and sometime corporate raider Vincent Bolloré, 66, has previously said that he would hand over his wide range of businesses to his four children by 2022. But it’s all happening sooner than we expected, writes Harriet Agnew for DD in Paris. Vivendi, the media group in which Bolloré’s family holding company is the largest shareholder, said on Thursday that he’ll step down from its supervisory board in April. Vivendi said it’ll ask shareholders to appoint Cyrille Bolloré — who currently runs the family company’s transport and logistics division — to replace his father on the supervisory board.  Bolloré senior has kept something of a low profile in Parisian circles recently. Since April last year he has been under formal investigation related to the alleged bribery of foreign officials in Africa. Later that month, he stepped down as chairman of Vivendi and was replaced by another son, Yannick Bolloré. Things are never entirely straightforward where Bolloré senior is concerned, and he’s never far from the action. But one thing’s for sure, he does like to keep it in the family. If you’re interested in some of Bolloré’s past legal struggles, see Harriet’s piece on the dealmaker.

"How bad behaviour by super-rich hits London’s wealth managers","Some clients have been ditched because of their questionable antics","At the London office of an exclusive Swiss wealth manager, a bowl of luxury Sprüngli truffles — costing nearly £2 a pop — sits in the reception as a perk for its ultra-rich clients. Recently, the head of the office came out of a meeting to find the receptionists “in a state of shock” after one multi-millionaire client tipped the entire bowl of truffles into his bag and headed off without saying a word. One receptionist pointed out that, had he only asked, they could have just given him a box from their storeroom. Bad behaviour by a minority of clients is par for the course in the supposedly genteel world of London’s scores of private banks and wealth managers serving the super-rich, according to multiple advisers who asked not to be identified. They complain of questionable antics that range from shouting at their companies’ employees and the pursuit of female staff, to demands for advice on aggressive tax avoidance. The breadth of bad behaviour that bankers and advisers cite reflects the UK capital’s status as a home for the super-wealthy. There were 9,370 people with assets of at least $30m in the UK in 2017, up 9 per cent on the previous year, according to a report by Wealth-X, a data company, putting the country in eighth place globally. Most London wealth managers only accept clients with at least £1m in investable assets. Some of the bad behaviour that bankers and advisers highlight is as tedious as clients repeatedly turning up late for meetings. “There’s always a sense of entitlement. I started to think he was doing it on purpose,” one wealth manager said. “There are some who flaunt the cash big time and are obnoxious,” said another wealth adviser. Serial philandering and aggression But it can be much more serious. One wealth manager told how a client — a “serial philanderer” — asked him if there were any young women working at the company that would like to meet him. Another adviser, referring to requests for help with tax avoidance, said: “You have meetings with clients where they basically say: ‘I don’t want to pay any tax’. And you have to tell them you can’t do that any more.”  Some banks and wealth managers will sever ties with clients rather than tolerate their antics. The head of one Swiss private bank said that it had parted ways with clients who had been “aggressive” towards the bank’s relationship managers, while a partner at a London-based private bank said they had also told clients to close their accounts with them after being rude to staff. Advisers said the most common reason for ditching existing or prospective clients was when they lied about the sources of their wealth or were unable to prove where it came from. The UK’s anti-money laundering regulations have been tightened up in recent years, resulting in greater scrutiny from banks when considering whether to take on new clients. One insider said that certain owners of English football clubs failed the test at his bank after it looked into the sources of their wealth.  The head of another private bank turned down a client worth more than £80m whose wealth had a “complex” history involving foreign courts. While trying to work out exactly where all the money came from, the banker found the prospective client had not been completely honest even though the provenance of the money ultimately seemed to be legitimate. A new British crime fighting tool affecting those serving the uber wealthy is the authorities’ use of so-called unexplained wealth orders against ‘politically exposed persons’ — such as politicians and civil servants, plus their family members. These orders require those affected to explain how they were able to afford certain assets. Being deemed a politically exposed person is a yellow card for some wealth managers, with the wealth management arm of UBS among those sometimes turning such people down as clients. Some of the more traditional banks are staying true to their conservative roots. One banker said a client was asked to leave after he “kept appearing in the wrong pages of all the wrong magazines” — referring to celebrity gossip publications. The wealth management arm of Rothschild & Co said it had turned down clients wanting “unrealistic” returns or “a more high-risk approach”. Turning a blind eye in a competitive market However, in some cases of bad behaviour, bankers and wealth managers ignore what has happened because of the enormous wealth that their clients have.  And in an industry where the wealthy are getting richer, those who are kicked out of one private bank are likely to find others willing to turn a blind eye to their faults.  No private bank or wealth manager dominates London’s provision of services to the super-rich, resulting in a fiercely competitive market among institutions that include Cazenove Capital, Rathbones, Rothschild & Co, UBS, Credit Suisse, Pictet and Julius Baer. The consequence is that clients often have significant power to dictate terms.  “The UK is a really fragmented market,” said Caroline Burkart at Scorpio Partnership, a wealth management consultancy. “You’ve got wealth managers and private banks all falling over each other to win new business so from a client’s perspective they’re spoilt for choice.” As one adviser put it: “In the wealth management industry, you have to kiss a lot of frogs.” This article has been amended to reflect that UBS does not automatically turn down politically exposed people as clients.

"Markets get their groove back after chaotic end to the year","Investors welcome US-China progress, more dovish Fed and still-bright earnings forecasts","The FTSE All-World index fell the first two days of 2019, but has now notched up five straight days of gains  Investors entered the new year nervously, whiplashed by one of the worst months for stocks in a decade and wary over the global economic slowdown. The first batches of economic data from China and the US were disappointing, stirring concerns that 2019 might continue where 2018 left off.  But after a brief wobble, some welcome calm has returned and buoyed markets once more. The FTSE All-World index fell the first two days of 2019, but has now notched up five straight days of gains, extending its bounce since the Christmas Day nadir to almost 8.5 per cent. There are several drivers of this shift in sentiment. Positive signs on US-China trade talks, growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will pause rate hikes and favourable corporate earnings predictions have all helped breathe fresh optimism into the market. But the biggest factor may simply have been that investors became far too pessimistic in December, when markets were beginning to price in the possibility of a painful economic downturn in 2019. When people realised that was still very unlikely, a rebound was natural, according to Sean Darby, global head of equity strategy for Jefferies. “We’re set up in global equities for a rally simply because the position has become very risk averse,” he said. “It makes me think of the old saying ‘Be fearful when everyone is greedy and greedy when everyone is fearful’. Well now everyone is fearful, I feel you should be going back and putting lots of money into equities.”  The trigger, however, was clearly the combination of strong US employment data — which assuaged concerns that the economy was weakening sharply — and Fed chair Jay Powell backtracking on his more hawkish comments. Last week he stressed that the central bank would be “patient” in tightening monetary policy and opened up the possibility that the central bank could tweak its “autopilot” policy of shrinking its balance sheet. The more cautious stance was then reinforced by a series of other dovish comments from Fed officials over the past week. The release on Wednesday of minutes from the December meeting indicated that still-low inflation and choppy financial markets meant that “many” policymakers thought the Fed “could afford to be patient about further policy firming”. As a result, the S&P 500 has jumped 10 per cent since its December low, with economically sensitive sectors such as household appliances, energy and homebuilders rocketing higher. But the rally has been broad. Of the 3,195 members of the FTSE All-World index, more than four-fifths have seen gains in January. “Powell changed his tune, and people feel more comfortable now,” said Adam Sender, chief investment officer of Sender Company & Partners, an asset manager. “People were offside and got extremely bearish, and now we have the snap-back.”  Valuations now also look more attractive, especially if growth remains resilient. The twin impact of lower oil prices and US workers receiving higher returns after income tax reform, will inject up to $170bn to the pockets of US consumers, UBS estimates. This should stave off fears of a US recession and boost cheap, growth-sensitive cyclical stocks, argues Keith Parker, the bank’s head of US equity strategy. “I think the cyclicals would be very mispriced and you’d get a recovery in broader cyclicals — financials, industrials, materials. That would lead the market and reverse the defensive positions we saw in 2018,” he said. However, the nervousness that spread across markets in 2018 is far from dispelled, with many analysts and fund managers still cautious on the coming year. John Chatfeild-Roberts, head of strategy at Jupiter Asset Management, said the recent bounce was nothing more than a “bear market rally” that would ultimately fizzle out. “Nothing goes down in a straight line,” he pointed out. “The underlying issues, from rising interest rates, quantitative tightening and overall debt levels, are still with us. Until the Federal Reserve changes course, expect more downside and then a new bull market, possibly later this year, but from lower levels.” Indeed, while many fund managers are anxiously waiting for clarity on the US-Chinese trade talks and the upcoming earnings season — which kicks off in the US next week — the Fed’s deliberations may be the deciding factor for markets in 2019. The strength of the US economy will guide the Fed’s decision on monetary policy but, given its influence over global interest rates, the consequences would echo everywhere. And the recent market stability could put higher rates back on its agenda.  Most economists have pencilled in two more rate increases this year, but the Fed funds market indicates that traders think the central bank is most likely to stay on hold through 2019. The implied odds of a solitary rate increase are roughly the same as for a rate cut. Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse, still reckons markets will enjoy healthy gains this year, but warns that if the Fed turns hawkish again then it could undermine the recent stability. “I think if the Fed starts to signal to the market that they’ll move again, I think the market is going to be extremely unhappy and I think the Fed will get a bloody nose,” he said.

"China’s ability to make computer chips still ‘years behind’ industry leaders","Rising costs of R&D and manufacturing create new hurdles","When Huawei released its latest chip set in Shenzhen this month, the state-run Global Times newspaper hailed the “groundbreaking” development as a “boost” for China’s domestic chipmaking industry, “often portrayed as overly reliant on foreign suppliers”. But the new server chip set, just like the telecoms company’s similarly feted advanced processor for smartphones, was only designed in China. It is manufactured in Taiwan, in the latest example of a persistent technology gap that hampers China’s efforts to become self-sufficient at manufacturing chips. Semiconductor sector analysts believe that China’s best chipmakers are as much as a decade behind their international rivals. That is despite long running financial support from Beijing, rising market dominance of Chinese electronics hardware groups and the vastly improved capabilities of China’s chip design companies. “It is going to be a long time before you have a domestic Chinese foundry that is going to be able to compete with either Samsung or TSMC,” said E Jan Vardaman, president of US-based consultancy TechSearch International, referring to the factories that make chips for other companies. Beijing’s poor use of state funds slowed the sector’s development historically and a hardening attitude in the west toward Chinese acquisitions of semiconductor companies, technology and talent, had in recent years dragged on China’s ability to catch up, experts said.  The gap is likely to widen further because of the increasingly higher costs of chip making equipment and of the research and development needed to produce the most advanced processors — used in applications such as high-performance computing, high-end mobile and gaming devices and artificial intelligence.
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s largest contract chipmaker with more than half of the contract chipmaking market, said on Thursday that it would continue with a research and development spend of 8 per cent to 9 per cent of annual revenues — a spend of roughly $2.9bn in 2018 — as it shrugged off a worsening near-term outlook amid a sudden decline in demand for high-end smartphones. By comparison, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, China’s biggest chip manufacturer, is expected to have spent about $550m on R&D last year, roughly 16 per cent of sales. “Manufacturing chips at the leading-edge is now incredibly difficult — there are no short-cuts — even Intel is struggling,” said Jim Fontanelli, a senior analyst at Arete Research in London. “The starting point is very deep R&D pockets followed by the best engineers in the industry. SMIC has neither. TSMC has both.”  Despite US fears over China’s rapid technological rise, analysts, underscoring the distance between the top players, point to SMIC’s most advanced chip — a 14 nanometre chip in testing for commercial production this year. Samsung reached this standard in 2014.  Given the rising costs of chip research, US-based GlobalFoundries and Taiwan’s United Microelectronics — the second- and third-largest foundry companies by sales, respectively — have in the past two years each quit the race to develop leading edge chips, instead focusing on innovation with more established chip sizes. SMIC said it would continue pursuing the development of advanced technology beyond 14 nanometres. Velu Sinha, Bain & Company partner in Shanghai, said Chinese semiconductor science and chip design capabilities were already at the cutting edge, but he noted challenges around accessing some of the key enabling technologies. Chinese chipmakers have been hamstrung as the leading chip factory equipment suppliers, all groups outside of China, work with the industry’s most advanced players in developing the next generation of tools for making chips, according to analysts. Dutch group ASML, for example, partnered with TSMC, Intel and Samsung in 2012 to accelerate the development of its extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithography technology, used to print and etch designs on to silicon. TSMC now uses ASML’s EUV machines to make its 7-nanometre processor chips — the industry’s current gold standard used to produce the core processor chips in Huawei and Apple’s latest smartphones. SMIC has spent $120m on an EUV tool, according to a Nikkei report, but Arete’s Mr Fontanelli forecast it would not be used for commercial production for “many years”. SMIC did not comment on its equipment purchases. “It’s a bit like buying an F1 engine with no F1 chassis, suspension or aero and expecting to go racing,” Mr Fontanelli said. “EUV will be an important part of leading-edge production over the next decade but there is a huge amount of non-lithography work that goes hand-in-hand with EUV to bring a leading-edge chip through manufacturing.” Experts said the Taiwanese and South Korean groups were again at the forefront in a wave of new technological developments sweeping through the semiconductor manufacturing industry. General-purpose chips are now being redesigned and optimised for specific tasks, and functions that have been separate, such as processing and memory, are now being combined on a single chip. Bain’s Mr Sinha said such new technologies marked a “fundamental transformation” as the industry moved beyond Moore’s law — the process whereby the numbers of transistors on a chip doubled every two years which has defined competition in the industry for decade — and would create new opportunities for China’s chip industry. And analysts would not rule out China’s eventual rise as a competitive chipmaker. “It is not a question of if, it is a question of when. But we are not talking a year or two, we’re talking five to 10 [years] before those technologies [in China] get caught up,” said Mr Sinha. In the meantime, however, Chinese electronics companies needing the world’s most advanced chips will still rely on chipmakers outside of China, according to Taipei-based Credit Suisse analyst Randy Abrams. “If Huawei wants to differentiate against global companies . . . in 2021 they will still have to go to TSMC or Samsung for their advanced gear because those will probably still be the most advanced foundries,” Mr Abrams said.","22.01.2019"
"Sequoia to make earlier and bigger bets in China","Venture capitalists increase firepower in competition for best tech start-ups","Sequoia China’s success has rested on a number of huge consumer internet companies, notably JD.com, the e-commerce site  Neil Shen, China’s most successful venture capitalist, is refining a twin-pronged approach as he invests in the country’s next generation of tech companies. Sequoia China, which the 51-year-old Mr Shen has headed for more than a decade, will increase its firepower through a new $8bn global growth fund, raised in a matter of months and with a large share of investment from China, as it tries to compete with the deep pockets of other investors, notably Softbank’s Vision Fund.  The financial strength of the Vision Fund was underlined again on Friday, when it emerged that it is in talks over a possible $1.5bn investment in the Chinese used car sales site Guazi.  At the same time, Sequoia China has raised a small $150m fund specifically to make very early calls on Chinese start-ups, either offering them seed funding or Series A investments. “We never want to miss a trend,” said Mr Shen in an interview, adding that it was essential to catch companies “early on”. At the same time, he acknowledged that he wants to be able to stay with companies as they grow through their funding rounds without being displaced by other investors.  “For Sequoia, what matters is to be first and to be the most important investor. You have to lead each round,” he said. “And today you can’t lead with $10m or even $100m sometimes. “Why should I let other investors have the upside in companies I have invested in when there is still so much appreciation?” he added. “Today, you need bigger amounts to stay in the game. We worry that we have been too conservative.” Sequoia China head Neil Shen says he wants to be able to stay with start-ups as they grow through funding rounds © Reuters He added that the trend for tech companies to remain private for longer will continue. “There will be many private companies worth between $5bn and $50bn in the next five to ten years,” he said. It took just five years, from 2012 to 2017, for the amount of money flowing into venture capital funds in China to rise from $5bn to $65bn, according to Credit Suisse, while half of the 180 or so Chinese tech companies priced at over $1bn reached that valuation in two years or less, compared to the typical nine-year period in the US. Sequoia entered the Chinese market in 2005 and has become the country’s leading blue-chip VC, while Mr Shen is tipped by some to become co-head of the firm worldwide.  Doug Leone, global managing partner, said the firm had bet on Mr Shen, formerly the chief financial officer of the travel firm Ctrip, and given the China team autonomy.  “We would rather take a calculated risk on Neil, someone who seemed capable but was an unproven professional investor, because we were sure that we in the US would not be effective at investing in China,” Mr Leone said. 
 To date, Sequoia China’s success has rested on a number of huge consumer internet companies, notably JD.com, the e-commerce site, Meituan Dianping, the food delivery to ticketing site, and ByteDance, which owns the Toutiao news app and TikTok, a short video sharing social media app. Sequoia invested $34.6m in ByteDance in 2014. Last June, the stake was valued at $885m, according to information Sequoia sent investors. That was before a capital raise that valued the company at $80bn. In the case of Meituan, Sequoia was also part of every funding round from the beginning in 2011 and Mr Shen retains a seat on its board — a factor many investors cited when they took part in the company’s listing in Hong Kong in September. “I watched Xing Wang for years,” Mr Shen said of Meituan’s founder. “We didn’t care that he wasn’t the largest in the early stages.”  Several analysts and people familiar with Sequoia said the firm ultimately expects to make more of a return on Meituan than it did from Google. However, Meituan has been waging a fierce war against a rival food delivery service, Ele.me, backed by Alibaba, and its share price has fallen nearly 40 per cent since it went public.  Other Sequoia-backed companies to IPO last year included Pinduoduo, the e-commerce site, which has seen its shares flatline since launching on Nasdaq in the summer and NIO, the electric car company, whose share price has dropped a third since its IPO in September. The poor performance of Chinese tech stocks has put pressure on private investors, and there is potentially more trouble ahead as the economy cools and Beijing presses for lower levels of debt. Bubbles in the valuations of companies, particularly in artificial intelligence, are starting to lose air. There are also fears that tech companies face greater regulation and scrutiny from Beijing. The correction in valuations also reflects the SoftBank effect in which large pools of capital drove prices to unsustainable levels — sparking a frenzy in sectors such as artificial intelligence. “China has never before seen a downturn in tech,” said Mr Shen. “Some investors have bet that China would never have this kind of dip.” Nevertheless, he retains his confidence that China’s AI companies will have the advantage of the huge data pool created by its 1.4 billion people. Sequoia’s smaller fund has invested in a number of AI start-ups, as well as life sciences and biotech start-ups that use big data to diagnose illness sooner and find more effective treatments. Sequoia rival Softbank Vision Fund is in talks over a possible $1.5bn investment  in the Chinese used car sales site Guazi  A glance at Sequoia China’s existing funds shows how the firm has spread its bets, with few investments larger than $50m, according to documents sent to investors, and many under $1m. Medtech is important to Sequoia on both sides of the Pacific but its China investments and local team is larger than that in Silicon Valley. One investment went into 4Paradigm, which sells machine learning programs. 4 Paradigm closed its Series C funding round in December, raising roughly $145m at a valuation of $1.2 billion and attracting funding from several Chinese state banks. The company’s founder, Dai Wenyuan, was backed by Mr Shen when he chose to leave Baidu to set up the start-up. His company is working with Ruijin hospital in Shanghai to comb through data from kidney diseases, and Mr Shen is also a donor and a partner of the hospital. In an illustration of the closeness of Sequoia’s relationship with its portfolio companies, Mr Dai’s wife, Wu Ming, who also left Baidu with her husband, now works in the VC firm’s Beijing office.  “Entrepreneurs should not automatically choose the investors that offer the highest valuation,” said Mr Shen. “There is additional value beyond the money. Also an investor like Sequoia can invest in multiple rounds including at times when the funding environment is tough.”","03.02.2019"
"Deutsche and Commerzbank: why Berlin is backing a merger","Rumoured for a decade, the move to combine Germany’s two largest banks now has political backing"," On an uncharacteristically bright early February day in London, German finance minister Olaf Scholz and his deputy Jörg Kukies spent the afternoon holed up in a series of discreet meetings at their embassy on the south-west corner of the city’s most exclusive square. Amid the chandeliers, Teutonic tapestries and silver service of the 19th-century Belgrave Square townhouse, the duo quizzed a succession of investment bankers from the likes of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America on the issue consuming the German finance sector. Not the slowing economy. Not Brexit. But what can be done to revive Deutsche Bank? And could a merger with Commerzbank save them both? Since the financial crisis, the condition of the two 149-year-old Frankfurt-based lenders has become parlous. Both have seen their share prices plunge more than 90 per cent in the past 11 years as they churned through eight chief executives — including the two incumbents, flip-flopping on strategy while raising more than €30bn in new equity. Deutsche has become the symbol of 
pre-crisis hubris for European banks trying to mimic American-style “casino” finance. At one point it even ended up owning a $4.3bn Las Vegas casino by accident.  On almost any measure of financial performance, Deutsche will be at or near the bottom of the list. It makes the lowest return on equity, has the worst cost-income ratio and pays the most to raise funds of its continental peers. Between 2011 and 2018 it made a cumulative net loss of €6bn and was fined $14.5bn for everything from mis-selling mortgage securities to its role in the Libor scandal. A combination with Commerzbank has long been floated as a way of reviving the fortunes of both banks, with rumours of a deal swirling around for more than a decade. But the match has never been consummated as both were busy removing toxic assets from their balance sheets, working through a series of post-crisis misconduct investigations and waiting for interest rates to rise again, to provide a boost to earnings.  Their self-help strategies have not worked. Deutsche’s stock has plunged to a record low and analysts openly question the viability of its business model.  And as Mr Scholz and Mr Kukies’ clandestine London meetings show, the idea is now gaining traction in Berlin. Policymakers and corporate bosses see a stable national banking champion as the backbone of their export-led industrial policy, vital if the country is to weather the next downturn that many economists warn looms large. 
 Deutsche has become the symbol of pre-crisis hubris for European banks trying to mimic American-style 'casino' finance © Bloomberg In turn, they hope a merger would help to re-establish Deutsche as a top-level capital markets player with the scale and reputation to hold back the encroachment of a revitalised Wall Street. Paul Achleitner, Deutsche’s chairman, has become the pivotal internal champion of a deal, according to people briefed on his thinking.
 “It is important that we in Europe remain strong and independent,” says Simone Menne, former chief financial officer of German airline Lufthansa and drugs maker Boehringer Ingelheim. “It may make sense to join forces and, when it comes to financial policy, to pursue a more European approach.” Yet, despite growing support for a merger in some business circles, there are many investors and executives arguing that combining the two banks would not remedy their problems.  “We think a deal only happens in the near term if Deutsche’s plan A is clearly failing and the share price is under [even more] severe pressure,” says Stuart Graham, founder of Autonomous Research. “A deal [would be] born out of desperation and hatched by a government seeking to prevent contagion.” The minister  © Getty Olaf Scholz Olaf Scholz joined the Social Democrats aged 17 and rose to be mayor of his home city Hamburg. Noted for his business-friendly attitude, his finance ministry has met Deutsche executives two-dozen times already as he wrestles with what to do with Germany’s problem child. At home he is known as “Scholz-o-mat” for his robotic, deadpan delivery.   Politicians have been forced off the sidelines after a particularly turbulent 2018 that started with Mr Achleitner firing dour British chief executive John Cryan in favour of Deutsche “lifer” Christian Sewing, and ended with police raiding the bank’s headquarters in a money laundering investigation. Bank insiders suggest these raids 
added some urgency to Berlin’s merger discussions.   Deutsche is also embroiled in a scandal at 
Danske Bank, the Danish lender. And the US Congress continues to investigate its longstanding business relationship with President Donald Trump. Leading the government’s Deutsche project is the softly-spoken, cerebral Mr Scholz, a business-friendly Social Democrat who Angela Merkel named vice-chancellor last year. Mr Kukies is his emissary to the financial world. The Harvard-educated, ex-Goldman Sachs derivatives trader is the opposite of his boss: confident, brash, ebullient. The uber-bank they imagine would be the second-largest eurozone lender behind BNP Paribas, with about €2tn of assets. It would hold €845bn of deposits, almost the size of Citigroup, have more than 2,500 branches and employ 141,000 people — compared with Deutsche’s 92,000 today. As many as 20,000 of those jobs could be lost, analysts say. The outcome of this saga has implications not only for the companies involved and Germany itself, but the continent’s banking industry as a whole.  Few European banks generate double-digit returns, considered the bare minimum by investors. That explains why many have repeatedly called for consolidation among the region’s 6,000 banks. Speculation over any merger is being taken more seriously this time. Mr Scholz has adopted a far more activist stance than his predecessor, arguing that having strong and stable banks is a question of “national sovereignty”. He told a conference that the troubles of German banks had created problems for industrial policy because they “don’t have the scale and global footprint necessary to escort the corporate sector [overseas]”. 
 A person close to the politicians says their desire for a national flag-bearer stems from the 2008 crisis, when panicked banks restricted the supply of credit. “Foreign banks repatriate capital in times of distress,” he says. “One really has to be mindful of that.” The dealmaker © Bloomberg Paul Achleitner Paul Achleitner’s almost seven years overseeing Deutsche will not go down as a golden period in the bank’s history. But the chairman has a chance at redemption if he can pull off a mega merger — that he is lobbying for internally — to save Germany’s floundering lenders. Famed for his connections, he is treasurer of the secretive Bilderberg Group of political and business elites, hobnobbing with the likes of Santander chairman Ana Botín and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Another of the ministry’s concerns is that Deutsche alone may be incapable of escaping from what James von Moltke, its chief financial officer, has called a “vicious cycle of declining revenue, sticky expenses, lowered ratings and rising funding costs”.  Last year the bank generated a net profit of €341m — its first since 2014 — but it was forecast to be 20 per cent higher. The group made a return on tangible equity of only 0.5 per cent in 2018, a 20th of its target, and its struggling investment bank made a €303m loss last quarter as big institutional clients took their business elsewhere. The government is even worried about the viability of Deutsche’s bread-and-butter corporate lending business in light of its escalating funding costs and deteriorating credit rating. “Counterparties wanting to do a 10-year [interest rate] swap are starting to ask themselves how long the lender will be around,” says a senior European regulator, who asked not to be named.  Mr Achleitner, who has overseen Deutsche for almost seven years, has become the key figure in the saga. He knows Mr Kukies well; both went to Harvard and ran Goldman Sachs’ operations in Germany and Austria earlier in their careers. The wily, gregarious 62-year-old Austrian, who started his career at Bain & Co, is one of the best-connected power brokers in German-speaking finance, also sitting on the boards of Daimler and drugs group Bayer.  However, his dealmaking record is chequered. As an executive at Allianz, Mr Achleitner oversaw the €24bn purchase of Germany’s Dresdner Bank in 2001. But within seven years Dresdner had lost half its value and the government was forced to broker a deal to sell it to Commerzbank. He is said to believe Deutsche is well-positioned to take on the mantle of Europe’s champion because investors and corporates are wary of US capital markets hegemony in light of rising economic nationalism. “There is a real demand for services that are not American,” a person close to Mr Achleitner says. “The American national interest might not be identical to the Europeans. To be that alternative, you just have to be the best of the rest.”
 Internally Mr Achleitner has argued that the acquisition of a broader base of retail deposits could also reduce and stabilise Deutsche’s funding costs, which have been snowballing in the past year.  The chief executive © Bloomberg Christian Sewing The 48-year-old has spent almost his entire career at Deutsche, working his way up from an apprentice in a branch in the north Rhine town of Bielefeld. While a specialist in risk management, since taking over in April 2018 he has tried to restore a “hunter mentality” among cowed staff beaten down by years of losses and negative headlines. Mr Sewing has said he wants to get his own house in order before considering a merger, but is careful to never contradict his chairman, in public or private. Yet many, inside both banks and investors, question the chairman’s arguments. “Economically, it does not make sense and it would be a total gift to our competitors,” says a Deutsche executive who asks not to be named. “People in Commerzbank don’t want the deal either. But I tell you who would love it — JPMorgan and BNP Paribas — because we would spend years distracted by it.” Mr Sewing has already complained to colleagues that the merger speculation has overshadowed the fact that the bank beat its targets on costs, job cuts and capital last year. Several of the bank’s top shareholders, contacted for this article, say Deutsche’s main problem is that it does not have a profitable core business to fall back on if it were to further overhaul its sprawling investment bank.  One executive at a rival likens the restructuring of big banks to repairing a jumbo jet mid-flight. As long as three of the four engines are still going, the plane stays aloft. “The problem is Deutsche only has one engine,” he says.  A Deutsche executive who asks not to be named said of the proposed merger: 'People in Commerzbank don’t want the deal either. But I tell you who would love it — JPMorgan and BNP Paribas — because we would spend years distracted by it' © Bloomberg Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse have trillion-franc wealth management businesses. Barclays is supported by reliably profitable retail and credit card units. By contrast, Deutsche and Commerzbank operate in a fiercely competitive and structurally unprofitable domestic market, dominated by hundreds of municipality-owned savings banks, known as Sparkassen, and regional co-operative lenders with no obligation to maximise profits.  In February, Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke abandoned almost all of its 2020 revenue and profitability targets, blaming anaemic interest rates and local competition. However, its cheap valuation — 33 per cent of the book value of its assets — and market-leading position lending to Germany’s Mittelstand companies make Commerzbank a potentially attractive target for foreign buyers.   Mr Zielke favours a domestic merger over a foreign takeover “because he thinks that he would have more control in such a scenario”, a senior German policymaker says. The government still owns a 15 per cent stake in Commerzbank after its 2009 bailout. Many observers argue, however, that a foreign takeover of one or other bank is preferable because there would be less overlap and fewer job losses. But few suitors have emerged. “To buy the problems of the Germans would be absolutely mad,” says the chairman of one bank that has been linked with Deutsche. “All mergers need to be executed in a brutal way; ‘synergies’ is just another word for brutally slashing costs.” In discussions with the government, Mr Achleitner has asked for guarantees he would be allowed to restructure without interference, arguing Germany’s low unemployment rate and social security net means it can cope with job losses. Whether he receives that assurance is another matter. In February, Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke abandoned almost all of its 2020 revenue and profitability targets, blaming anaemic interest rates and local competition © Bloomberg Cerberus, the US private equity fund, is one of the largest shareholders in both lenders. Despite sitting on paper losses from the share price fall of about €600m, the company backs the merger, sources familiar with its thinking say. However, Cerberus has few allies. Five other top 10 shareholders in Deutsche told the Financial Times they are highly sceptical about, or staunchly opposed to, a merger.
 Their concerns are rooted in Germany’s terrible record of bank integrations, particularly the painful state-arranged 2008 merger of Commerzbank and Dresdner, as well as Deutsche’s own botched acquisition of retail lender Postbank the same year. “Combining two sick men does not create a healthy one,” warns one shareholder.  Verdi, Germany’s service sector union, is also in the no-deal camp. “We do not back such a scenario because we are concerned about another big loss in jobs,” says Jan Duscheck, head of its banking group and a member of Deutsche’s supervisory board. Analysts are also unpersuaded about the numbers. JPMorgan’s Kian Abouhossein estimates a tie-up could generate €2bn in cost synergies within five years, but they would be offset by €4bn of integration costs. Moreover, due to client overlap the German superbank would lose close to €1bn in revenue, he adds. Mr Graham of Autonomous Research says regulators would impose a higher “global systemically important bank” capital surcharge of 50 basis points, so the bank would have to hold more than 14 per cent of common tier one equity, to reflect the joint group’s larger balance sheet and complexity. That means the group might need to raise an additional €3bn in equity. “From a financial market stability point of view, this would be an extremely bad idea,” because it would create a behemoth “even more difficult to wind down in a crisis”, says Isabel Schnabel, a member of the government’s Council of Economic Experts. 



 However, with an influential chairman campaigning for a deal — and a government prepared to take charge of Germany’s biggest systemic risk — politics could trump the pessimists. Letter in response to this article: Deutsche-Commerz tie-up is no laughing matter / From Peter D Hahn, London, UK

"Foxconn: why the world’s tech factory faces its biggest tests","As he bids to lead Taiwan, Terry Gou must respond to challenges such as the US-China trade war and a shift to niche products","© FT montage / Reuters / Getty Few companies epitomise the era of globalisation better than Hon Hai, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer. Known as Foxconn Technology Group, its formula for success includes: massive plants in China run with an abundant supply of low-cost labour, proximity to clusters of suppliers and a reliance on free trade and a seemingly insatiable global appetite for mass market devices.  Over the past 15 years, Foxconn has grabbed a significant share of the orders to make personal computers and smartphones for brands such as Apple, Dell and Huawei. Along with rival manufacturers from Taiwan such as Quanta Computer, Pegatron and Wistron, it has led a constant race to make the manufacturing process cheaper, faster and more efficient. This Tuesday will be a historic day for Foxconn, when it will host an investor conference for the first time ever. On the agenda at the event in the Taipei suburb of Tucheng, which translates as Dirt City, is the looming existential challenges for a company which is both the world’s largest assembler of Apple iPhones and China’s biggest private sector employer.  The immediate order of business is to explain how the company will be run after Terry Gou, the tycoon who founded it 45 years ago, steps down as chairman to enter politics and run for the Taiwanese presidency. But the even bigger issue will be how Foxconn plans to navigate two separate threats from politics and from artificial intelligence which have the potential to wreck the business model of the handful of Taiwanese electronic manufacturing services companies that dominate the consumer technology supply chain.  The company is caught in the middle of the escalating trade war between the US and China — the one-time champion of globalisation now suffering as more hawkish members of the Trump administration seek ways to “decouple” the two countries’ technology sectors. But it is also trying to come to terms with the impact of AI, which is leading to a shift in the market away from the mass production that fuelled its growth towards more niche, higher-margin items.  Reflecting worries over these challenges, Hon Hai’s share price has dwindled by 51 per cent over the past two years to T$71 on Friday. Last week, Mr Gou warned of a “tsunami” in the global economy triggered by the trade war. With the US government raising tariffs to 25 per cent on $200bn of Chinese goods and blacklisting telecoms equipment maker Huawei last month, Taiwan contract manufacturing executives have been scrambling to shift at least some production out of China. Foxconn founder Terry Gou hopes to be the candidate for the opposition Kuomintang in next January’s presidential election  That is an endeavour fraught with difficulties. “It is nearly impossible to replicate the ecosystem we have in China quickly,” says Jean-Frederic Kuentz, a senior partner at McKinsey, the consultancy. “The first problem is that there is not enough manpower. The second is the network of suppliers — panel makers, moulding companies, component makers. It is a big, big headache.”
 The changes brought to the market by AI are at least as disruptive for the industry. Last year, global shipments of smartphones — a product that accounts for more than half of Foxconn’s revenue — dropped 4.5 per cent to 1.39bn units, and this year will see a 3.1 per cent decrease, according to Canalys, a technology research firm. Experts believe that even if growth returns next year, underpinned by the adoption of 5G, the boom days for smartphones are over. “For many functions that are on your smartphone today, you will soon no longer need it,” says Yu Kai, co-founder of AISpeech, a Chinese voice recognition start-up that Foxconn has invested in. “Some of them will be taken over by smart speakers, others by alternative home appliances, yet more by applications in your car. We may even see the day where the concept of a device becomes obsolete altogether as you interact via voice or image recognition with your environment.” Some of the new AI-powered market segments, such as smart speakers, are growing fast. Applications in the automobile industry, medical services and robotics also offer growing returns. But analysts say these segments are too small and technologically too demanding to allow Taiwanese firms to quickly replace revenue and profits from their current range of IT products. In-car electronics is a market segment with higher technical barriers to entry but also much higher profit margins © Bloomberg “At the moment, you have mass market products with more than 2bn units. Some of the new products will be in the tens of thousands of units. Only wearables are going to be in the hundreds of millions,” says Manish Nigam, head of Asian technology research at Credit Suisse. “There is no single new mass market product out there, so there will be consolidation among the contract manufacturers.”
 Analysts say a focus on scale — the very strategy that boosted Foxconn and its Taiwanese peers in the last few tech cycles featuring the laptop, the tablet and the smartphone — is now making it harder for them to adjust. “As HP, IBM, Dell, Apple came knocking on their door with huge volumes of things to be made, the Taiwanese never really diversified into the other things with low volume but much higher margins and also much higher technology threshold,” says another technology analyst. “They really completely collectively missed this. So now it’s a lot more complicated because in those niches where there is growth, it is not the EMS industry incumbents that benefit.” Some experts believe that some of the contract manufacturing companies in the region that lost much of their IT business to Foxconn a decade ago could end up being the biggest beneficiaries of the new market segments. They name, for instance, Singapore-based Flextronics and Venture, both of which have sizeable businesses making electronics hardware for the medical sector.  Liu Rufeng, a vice-president at AISpeech who works with manufacturers to develop hardware solutions for its voice recognition applications, says traditional EMS firms are mostly absent from these new areas. “The hardware manufacturers that make smart speakers are often companies that were already making traditional speakers, such as TCL and Guanjie,” he says. “It is mainly Chinese companies, not the big Taiwanese EMS firms. In white goods, it’s the traditional white goods makers.” As for in-car electronics, a market segment with higher technical barriers to entry but also much higher profit margins, Mr Liu says Chinese electronics contract manufacturers including Huayang and Botai were taking the lead. Many of the big Taiwanese contract manufacturing firms are struggling to address these challenges — at a time when the US-China friction is likely to put additional strain on profit margins and is forcing some to rethink the way they organise their operations. Foxconn is China’s biggest private sector employer with 90 per cent of the group’s over 1m employees based in the country © AFP Pegatron, Foxconn’s closest rival, has relocated some production from China to Indonesia. The company is building a plant in Vietnam and eyeing production in India. Executives caution that such a footprint spread out over thousands of kilometres and across borders will significantly change the cost structure of production.
 Tung Tzu-hsien, Pegatron chairman and chief executive, says no other country could offer as attractive an investment environment as China was able to in the past, with a massive workforce that gave companies headcounts in the hundreds of thousands, consistent policies that were backed by several generations of officials and a wide range of nearby component makers. “That will not appear anywhere else again,” he says. “Where will we move next? I don’t know. Or will it no longer be fashionable to keep moving, and automation and robots will radically change the face of manufacturing?” Wistron, the third-largest assembler of Apple’s iPhone, saw the contribution from its smartphone business drop to 15 per cent of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018, less than half of what it had been a year earlier. Simon Lin, company chairman, said in March that he expected smartphone revenues to stabilise at this lower level, but at the same time the company is building a smartphone plant in India. Pressed by investors why Wistron would not phase out its smartphone business altogether if it was a drag on profits, Mr Lin said the company would be extremely cautious with any further capital investment.  “They are like a deer in the headlights,” says a Wistron investor. Chinese productivity is threatened by reduced access to new technology © Bloomberg The same cannot be said of Foxconn. Mr Gou has been continuously reinventing his business empire over the years. Having started out making plastic parts for television sets, he not only diversified into game consoles, PCs, laptops and smartphones, but also expanded upstream into manufacturing higher-margin components. Foxconn also made forays into automobile electronics more than a decade ago.  Mr Gou started to seriously work on automation several years ago. Shocked by a string of suicides among young migrant workers in the company’s vast factory towns in China, he pledged in 2011 to install as many as 1m robots in Foxconn plants within a few years. Although the company is still far short of that target — analysts estimate the number of robots in Foxconn plants in China is less than 20,000 — Mr Gou’s automation push is part of a much bigger plan. Through Foxconn Industrial Internet, an affiliate that listed in Shanghai last year, the group is attempting to meld robotics, data analytics and the internet of things in a way that would allow revolutionary efficiency gains in its own factories and that it could also sell to others. Advances in artificial intelligence have prompted a shift in the market away from the mass market products that fuelled growth to more niche devices © AISpeech Foxconn calls those production lines “lights-off factories” — a term that means that it no longer needs to rely on humans to worry about problems such as tools wearing out or accidents on the line. One of the production lines where this concept is most advanced, in Foxconn’s big plant in Shenzhen, has been included in a World Economic Forum list of “lighthouse” factories highlighting future trends in manufacturing.
 But industry experts say that so far Mr Gou’s beacon is little more than an experiment. “Most of FII’s revenue is still traditional, labour-intensive assembly,” says one analyst. A former Foxconn executive wants to use the new technologies to reduce inventory to zero. But he adds that progress was very slow because customers would need to share sensitive data on demand from customers — which they are all reluctant to do. The initiative also has a flipside: FII has been listed as a leading company under Made in China 2025, the Chinese government’s plan to turbo-boost an indigenous technology industry. In that context, the Chinese government fast-tracked FII’s Shanghai IPO last year. “We believe that Terry Gou had to promise the Chinese leaders certain things in exchange, including to help push their domestic tech industry,” says a Taiwanese banker. Such perceptions are not helpful against the backdrop of the escalating technology and trade fight between Beijing and Washington. Foxconn is already more directly in the line of fire than most because no one else has made a bigger bet on China. About 90 per cent of the group’s over 1m employees are in China. The company is China’s largest exporter, accounting for 4.2 per cent of the country’s total exports last year. Mr Gou appears acutely aware of the risks. In recent speeches, he oscillated between suggesting that Taiwan’s technology industry mediate between China and the US and urging the country to organise its companies to “go to America and rebuild the supply chain”. Those were just campaign speeches. Foxconn’s investors are likely to demand that Mr Gou’s successors take a clearer stance. Presidential race Gou learns from errors in energetic campaign
 Over the past 45 years, Terry Gou transformed his business, Hon Hai Precision Industry, from a tiny workshop in a rented shed into a global player with almost $170bn in revenues last year. His clients know how: with imagination, attention to detail and, above all, tenacity. Now Mr Gou is applying his marketing skills to politics. Having jumped into the race to become the candidate for the opposition Kuomintang in next January’s presidential election, the tycoon has started selling himself to the Taiwanese electorate. His campaign did not start smoothly — Mr Gou disrupted an international conference on Taiwan-US relations with complaints that he had been denied the necessary respect, a performance that triggered ridicule of his notoriously big temper. When addressing the KMT’s central standing committee, he fumbled for his glasses in his pockets before he could start reading a meandering speech. But Mr Gou has since upped his game. He has had a makeover, including sharper suits and ties and a professional haircut. He is spreading his policy ideas through online talk shows and public lectures. “In 2020, we need to elect a leader who understands the economy and industry,” he wrote in a Facebook post last week. Mr Gou, feared by employees for his authoritarian leadership style, is going far beyond advertising his qualities as an entrepreneur. His campaign events have been focused on young people, women and farmers, softening his image as a ruthless businessman. Last week, he had a young woman teach him to make little fabric sacks stuffed with herbs, a traditional mosquito repellent in rural Taiwan, where he showed off his knowledge of fragrant herbs. Other appearances included a sleepover in a rural dwelling and helping in the kitchen of a fried chicken shop, whose PhD owner Mr Gou had earlier mocked over his modest business.","10.06.2019"
"London’s cut-price mansions: expect more deep discounts ","Ken Griffin’s £95m purchase is just the start of a slew of prime property bargains, experts say"," When news broke that US hedge fund manager Ken Griffin paid £95m for a London mansion, it made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. It was not the amount the billionaire founder of Citadel paid for the home that caught the attention of property pundits — he went on to make an even pricier purchase in New York several days later — but the price he did not pay.  The 20,000 sq ft home near Buckingham Palace, remodelled by property developer Mike Spink and backed by private equity group Evans Randall, had an initial asking price of £145m and had languished on the market for two years priced at £125m. According to London buying agents, Griffin’s cut-price purchase last week may be just the start, as fears grow over the health of the city’s prime property market, spooking lenders and sparking an increase in heavily-discounted sales.  Falling prices and slowing sales of homes valued above £5m — transactions of such properties in 2018 were 36 per cent lower than in 2014, according to Savills — have led to banks and other lenders routinely revaluing homes downwards, agents say, and requesting more cash from developers who are already strapped. Many must now slash prices, accept low offers or face collapse.  “I have seen more repossessions of super-prime homes in central London in the last year than in the 10 years prior,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision, a buying agent focused on prime central London.  Smaller, niche developers have been hit hardest, says Henry Pryor, another buying agent based in London. “A lot of the funders of these developments are offloading their positions, turning the screw on developers,” he adds. “The hedge funders who thought that property was a doddle are getting out.” “It’s worse for the single house developers, especially those who bought sites in 2013 and 2014 at the high point in the market,” says Scarisbrick.  Jonathan Harris of Anderson Harris, which arranges mortgages for luxury homes, estimates that more than half of London properties bought by private individuals for more than £5m include some type of mortgage.  With banks’ appetites waning, these buyers are feeling the pressure. “It’s no secret that the bank valuers are extremely cautious at the moment: when they come to revalue something there is a loan on they will mark it down 10 or 20 per cent,” says Scarisbrick.  A quarter of loans taken out at the market peak in 2014 have since faced a margin call thanks to the drop in prime home values, says Harris. “It depends on the asset: if the property is worth below £10m there is less urgency, but if you’re lending on a £15m or £30m property, things will be different.”  What do you get for £95m? 3 Carlton Gardens, St James's London  Behind the Grade II-listed, John Nash-designed exterior, 3 Carlton Gardens has many of the features you might expect in any super-prime home: the pool, the staff quarters, the gym and the subterranean extension, all sprawled across nearly 20,000 square feet. For that money, though, Ken Griffin does not get his own driveway, and must share one with the foreign secretary, whose official residence is next door. In 2013, the home was bought by Mike Spink, developer and designer to the ultra-wealthy, for £65.5m, who completely remodelled it.  George Hammond
 The typical loan duration is five years, he says, meaning many loans taken out at the peak will fall due this year. Lenders are not high street banks. Even traditional private banks like Weatherbys or C Hoare & Co tend to prefer British landed wealth over the newly affluent from abroad, who have become the major acquirers in London’s super-prime market, says Harris. Typically they will use large firms with a global presence, such as Kleinwort Hambros (part of Société Générale), UBS and Credit Suisse. These firms’ international banking networks allow foreign buyers to use assets at home as collateral for a mortgage on a London purchase. 
 In March, a home on Cresswell Place in Kensington was sold for £21.6m in a deal facilitated by several estate agents, including Beauchamp Estates, Ian Green, Russell Simpson and Savills. An agent, who wished to remain anonymous, says the home was first marketed at £42.5m in 2015 and the developer turned down an offer “in the thirties” soon after. After the receivers were appointed last February, they slashed to price to £20.95m.  Camilla Dell of prime London buying agent Black Brick recently acted for the buyer of Red Lion House, a six-bedroom converted pub in Mayfair, another repossession sale. When the bank made a further margin call to reflect the lower value in the falling market, the owner ran out of cash and defaulted, leaving the bank racing to sell the house, she says. First marketed at £25m last year, the home was sold in November for £15m: at £1,748 per sq ft this was a 20 per cent discount on the average Mayfair sale in 2018, according to LonRes. While the total number of repossessions is still small, there is growing pressure on developers to reduce prices to avoid joining the pile, meaning further sharp price cuts are likely. “Repossession is the nuclear option,” says Scarisbrick, so lenders will typically go to great lengths to avoid it. As soon as the receiver is appointed, he says, it affects the perception of value in the whole market. Bargain buys This 11-bedroom townhouse in Belgravia had its price reduced by £6m in November to £30m  So where might bargain hunters with a spare £30m start their search? The day after the FT reported the story about Ken Griffin’s purchase of 3 Carlton Gardens, £6.05m was cut from the price of a seven-bedroom townhouse on Cowley Street, less than a mile away, by developer Saigol DDC. The new price of £29.95m, through the agent Rokstone, represents a drop of 17 per cent. The super-rich looking for something further out of town might consider the six-bedroom house on Canons Close, a cul-de-sac off Bishop’s Avenue near Hampstead Heath, listed for sale at £11.95m with Glentree Estates. The price represents a cut of more than £4m, or 26 per cent, of the home’s original listing price last January. The developer, Friroka Group, knocked down the old home on the site and rebuilt the current one from scratch. “The new price cuts out the negotiating room, not the value,” says Trevor Abrahmsohn of Glentree Estates, sounding, perhaps, the desperate side of optimistic. In Belgravia, an 11-bedroom townhouse in Wilton Crescent is for sale for £30m with Rokstone. This price follows a £6m cut made in November, just over a year after the home was put on the market.    This article has been amended since publication to correct the sale price of a property in Cresswell Place, and to name the different estate agents involved in that sale

"Emerging market equities justify their existence","Risk, return and diversification benefits appear to stack up, despite criticism","A recent column in the Wall Street Journal asked whether it was time to scrap the concept of “emerging markets,” at least when it comes to investing in equities. The premise of the piece was that, as stock markets in the emerging world have matured, their performance has become more like that of their developed world peers, with fewer large over- or undershoots, eroding the supposed benefits of diversification. Moreover, the definition of “emerging market” is very broad. The widely followed MSCI benchmark encompasses South Korea and Taiwan — commonly viewed as developed in many contexts. Many readers enjoy robustly pointing this out whenever we refer to the pair as EMs in equity market terms — alongside far poorer nations such as India and South Africa.  The WSJ column argued that it “doesn’t seem to make much sense to group such diverse countries together”.  While these arguments have much validity, recent academic analysis suggests the concept of “emerging markets” is still useful for investors.  For 20 years Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, academics at London Business School, have been assembling and analysing a trove of financial market data stretching back to 1900. This year the trio’s Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook turned its attention to emerging markets, where long-term research has hitherto been stymied by a lack of data. Some data dearths cannot be avoided. The first EM stock index was only created in 1985, so Messrs Dimson, Marsh and Staunton have had to come up with a classification of which countries would have been classed as EMs if an index had existed before then. They settled on countries with a gross domestic product per head of less than $25,000 in 2010 terms. They say this has largely been an accurate guide as to what has been considered an EM since 1985, when S&P launched the inaugural index. This allows them to construct a seven-country EM index from 1900. This comprises China, Finland, Japan, Portugal, Russia, South Africa and Spain.  Some of these countries would then have exited as they became developed (such as Finland in 1932, Japan in 1967 and Spain in 1974). Others would have joined as the data became available, such as India in 1953, Brazil in 1955 and Malaysia in 1964. Chile and Argentina, both deemed to be “developed” in 1900, would have been added in 1976 as their income per head slipped below the $25,000 threshold, staying there thereafter. Since 1988, the analysis is based on the MSCI EM index. The resulting picture is not pretty for EMs. Since 1900 they have returned 7.2 per cent per annum in total return terms, turning $1 into $3,745. This might sound impressive, until it is realised that developed markets have returned 8.2 per cent per year over this period, with that dollar now worth $11,821. However, as the first chart shows, the discrepancy is really all down to the events of the 1940s. Investors in the Chinese market were wiped out after the communist takeover and Japanese equities plunged 98 per cent in dollar terms after the country’s defeat in the second world war. (A smaller wobble can be seen after the Russian Revolution in 1917.)  Assuming (rightly or wrongly) that such events will not recur and thus looking purely at the period since 1950, EMs have actually outperformed, with annualised returns of 11.7 per cent, versus the 10.5 per cent of DMs.  However the LBS team believe this paints an unsustainably rosy picture of both DM and, especially, EM returns, given that the post-1950 period saw a number of “non-repeatable factors” such as the end of the Cold War, an acceleration of productivity growth and corporate governance becoming stockholder-driven.  Instead, they estimate that the future equity premium (ie return over that of Treasury bills) for developed markets is around 3.5 per cent per annum and that of EMs between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent. “They have a higher beta relative to the world index. Because of that we would expect them to outperform by perhaps 0.5 per cent above developed markets over the next 40-50 years or so,” said Mr Marsh. If so, this validates the idea of investing in EMs from a return perspective. Most informed investors, however, would also take into account the relative risk. The LBS team’s work suggests that while EMs remain riskier than developed ones (as indicated by the higher beta), the difference has narrowed markedly over time. The average EM exhibited a 60-month standard deviation (a measure of volatility) of 21.2 per cent in the five years to December 2018. While this is above the 11 per cent figure for the US equity market and 15.6 per cent reading for the typical non-US developed market, it is well below the levels of 30-45 per cent commonly witnessed in EMs before the global financial crisis, as the second chart illustrates.  Moreover, in practice few people will invest in a single emerging market, but rather a collection of them.  To reflect this, the academics created an equal-weighted basket of 31 EMs and found the 60-month rolling standard deviation for this universe has, if anything, tended to be lower than that for an equivalent basket of 20 non-US developed markets, in recent years. “The risk of EMs has fallen over time as they have matured, as they have become bigger and as they have introduced companies that are doing business all over the place. So a portfolio of EMs is only slightly riskier than a portfolio of DMs,” Mr Marsh said.  “EMs have not moved together to the same extent as DMs, so it has been possible for these rather more volatile EMs to come together to not be as volatile.”  Contrary to popular perception, this points to why, in fact, it may make sense to group such dissimilar countries together as emerging markets.  “The very diversity of EMs is actually helpful to investors,” said Mr Marsh. “It reveals the scope for diversification within the EM world.”  Despite declining risk, emerging markets do still seem to provide useful diversification benefits, though. The LBS team analysed the extent to which the returns of the various EM and (non-US) DM indices could be explained by the behaviour of the US market.  They calculated an R-squared measure for each index, where a reading of 100 per cent indicates that the variability of an index is entirely explained by movements on Wall Street and 0 per cent means it is entirely uncorrelated to the latter. A lower R-squared therefore indicates a greater opportunity to reduce risk via diversification. The trio’s rolling R-squared measure for the average EM is currently around 14 per cent, having returned to the levels of the early 2000s, before it spiked sharply higher with the onset of the global crisis, as shown in the final chart.  In comparison, the figure for the average DM is far higher, at around 41 per cent, even if it too has retreated from post-GFC highs.  When both individual emerging and developed markets are packaged together into portfolios the correlations rise. However, the figure for the equally weighted EM basket (31 per cent at the end of 2018) has been consistently lower than that for DMs (63 per cent as of December). This suggests that the diversification benefits of EMs are greater than those of non-US developed markets for the typical US-based investor. Separate analysis suggests the risk reduction from EM exposure is greater still for investors based in the likes of Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the UK.   “The R-squared of correlation between DMs and the US has risen. Therefore the scope for diversification via DMs has fallen,” said Mr Marsh. “In the 1980s, the correlation between EMs and the US was virtually zero. Now, with more EM companies doing business in the US, it has gone up, but it’s still well below what we see in DMs. “One-third of the variation is explained by the US, versus two-thirds for other DMs. Therefore, at the margin, EMs are better diversifiers. It’s worth investing in EMs because the risk reduction gains are greater,” he added. This analysis would therefore, on the face of it, seem to justify both the concept of “emerging market” equities and the rationale for investing in them. There is one potential danger on the horizon, however. Index providers such as MSCI have started adding mainland Chinese A-shares to their EM benchmarks, alongside Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and the US. When this process is complete, China is likely to account for around 40 per cent of the EM universe, up from 32.5 per cent at present. If that comes to pass the diversity of the index, one of its current strengths, would start to fray, potentially fatally so.    ","27.03.2019"
"Private equity: Super-crazy fees?","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Is the private equity bubble about to burst? Some of our colleagues think so. For now though, the top tier of the buyout business is showing no signs of fatigue. In the latest sign of buoyant times for the PE industry, DD’s Javier Espinoza reports that certain buyout firms are now charging more than the usual 20 per cent performance fees that they claim on successful deals. In some cases, PE firms are now capturing up to 30 per cent of the profits they generate for clients.  The rise of the so-called super carry is being led by some of the largest names in the sector — from The Carlyle Group and Vista Equity Partners in the US to EQT and Eurazeo in Europe. And you better believe general partners are happy about this: “This shows a complete rebalancing of power in favour of buyout funds,” the head of a multibillion-euro private equity group in Europe told DD. “[After the crash] the industry was shaking like rats in a cage because of fears that we were going to have to reduce our carried interest and, lower our management fees.”   
  As you’d imagine, investors in PE funds are not as thrilled, especially as the asset class has been under pressure to reproduce the stellar returns of the pre-crisis era. Graham McDonald, head of global private equity at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of the UK’s biggest institutional investors, said: “Super carry is not necessarily something investors are entirely comfortable with because levels of reward and alignment are already healthy at the moment.” He added: “Investors are feeling a bit sore about it.” Just don’t expect private equity groups to stop rising their lucrative fees. “Twenty per cent carried interest has been the market norm across the industry for decades so it’s very hard to shift,” said Jason Glover, a London partner at law firm Simpson Thacher, on the sidelines of a PE event in Berlin earlier this year. “However, there’s clearly an argument to say that significant outperformance would merit even greater rewards. In that context, there’s the opportunity to be able to charge higher carry.” And it’s not just private equity groups charging higher fees. Among hedge funds, DE Shaw, founded by the reclusive billionaire computer scientist David Shaw, is now charging investors 3 per cent in management fees and 30 per cent in performance fees — higher than the typical “2 and 20”.   
  This comes despite increased pressure in the industry to cut fees. Thanks to DE Shaw’s recent strong performance, the firm feels strong enough to demand more. Or you can take your money out, but the catch is good luck ever trying to get back in again — the fund has been closed to new investors since 2013. Read Javier Espinoza’s full analysis on the private equity fees here and Robin Wigglesworth’s story on DE Shaw here.  Why billionaires are concerned about capitalism America’s decades-old system of corporate capitalism is facing criticism from an unlikely group of people — Wall Street CEOs.   Jamie Dimon
 (below), the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase who pocketed $30m last year and Ray Dalio
, who is worth $17bn as the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, have both expressed concern about the sustainability of capitalism in its current form.   
  Why are business leaders encouraging an overhaul of the very system that helped make them rich? It could be a hedge against a Democratic win the White House next year, writes the FT’s Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson. To be clear, America’s wealthiest and most powerful citizens aren’t saying we should do away with capitalism entirely, they’re suggesting that the system can be fixed. Both Dimon and Dalio (below) have recommended taxing the wealthy to increase investments in education, healthcare and infrastructure — common rhetoric among Democratic presidential hopefuls.   
  The changing tide coincides with the rise of self-described democratic socialists like presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which has pushed the Democratic party to run on a platform that focuses on fighting inequality and political disillusionment. With inequality on the rise, young voters have shifted away from capitalism and towards socialism, according to a 2018 Gallup poll, prompting America’s leading capitalists to push for pre-emptive reforms that could save their free market system before it’s too late. But any boss launching into a discussion of inequality risks inviting an uncomfortable discussion about their own wealth, against almost four decades of wage stagnation for American workers.   
  Some chief executives are earning 1,000 times as much as their median employee, according to the executive compensation consultancy, Equilar. Others even more. Disney heiress, Abigail Disney, has accused her grandfather’s entertainment company of contributing to widening economic inequality by paying chief executive Bob Iger an “insane” $65.7m last year. That’s 1,424 times as much as the median Disney employee by Equilar’s estimation. If you’d like to see more on the topic, take a look at Andrew’s discussion with readers in the comments section. Beijing’s growing appetite for failure Large corporate defaults have only recently been allowed by the Chinese government. A provincial level state-owned enterprise was permitted to miss a payment on a US dollar denominated bond in February, an incident that would have been unthinkable just two years ago. Beijing is starting to realise that it can’t shoulder the risk of an all state-backed sector. Technocrats are coming around to the idea that defaults must occur if risk is to be priced in. But a missed payment at China Minsheng Investment Group in February, followed by the triggering of an $800m cross default by the company last week, has raised eyebrows given its pedigree. Here’s the full FT story. CMIG is considered China’s largest private investment group and its formation in 2014 was supported by Li Keqiang, the country’s premier. According to the company’s website, CMIG was the “brainchild” of the premier, giving it an apparent blessing from the highest reaches of the Chinese government. CMIG declined to answer questions on Friday regarding its connection to Li.   
  The cross-defaults are connected to $800m in bonds issued by one of its early investors, on which CMIG had provided keepwell deeds that function as comfort letters to investors but don’t have the legal standing of full guarantees. The missed payment earlier this year and the cross defaults are giving pause to fixed-income investors who thought they had a handle on the Chinese market.

"Can Buffett rediscover his mojo and outperform the S&P 500?","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Warren Buffett holds many titles — the sage of Omaha, America’s favourite capitalist and the third-richest man in the world — but the one he’s most proud of still seems to be the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. The billionaire investor spent three hours with DD’s own Eric Platt and the FT’s Robert Armstrong and Oliver Ralph in his office in Omaha to reflect on his legacy, expectations and finding value in a booming market. We suggest you read the full write-up here. There’s a reason why Buffett is widely cited as an inspiration and mentor to some of the world’s best-known investors. Berkshire’s performance is almost unprecedented — over the past 54 years, the company’s shares have outpaced the S&P 500 by almost 2.5m percentage points.   
  Buffett’s success first came from buying up misunderstood and undervalued shares and companies, or “picking up cigar butts”, as it came to be known. While Buffett and Berkshire have remained superficially unchanged — he still lives in the same house he bought in the 1950s and works at the desk his father used 75 years ago — the investment formula is entirely different today. The brilliance of modern Berkshire, as Buffett puts it, is that it doesn’t take a genius to run it. “I’ve got an interesting business. It’s simple enough,” he says. “I always tell people: if they’ve got more than 130 points of IQ, sell the rest because you’re not going to need it in this business. It may hurt you.”   
  But modern Berkshire is playing in a different market and over the past decade Buffett has fallen behind the S&P 500. He’s never had anywhere near as long a stretch of underperformance or this kind of competition for the types of assets he prefers. When asked which would be the better investment to put in a child’s account — a share in Berkshire, or a share in the S&P — he said he thought the “financial result would be very close to the same”. Berkshire also sits on a ton of cash, more than $1tn, and it’s hard to put that to work when bankers and private equity firms are grafting for borrowers. The obvious solution is to get rid of some by paying a dividend or selling off business units, but for Buffett, buying back shares seems the only reasonable option.   
  Talk inevitably turns to succession as Buffett nears 90. But he’s got no plans to slow down, saying he stays at the helm of Berkshire because he wants to keep doing what he loves. “I’m having a vacation every day. If there was someplace else I wanted to go, I’d go there. This is the pleasure palace here — you’re sitting in it now. I have more fun here than I think any 88-year-old is having, virtually, in the world.” Part of the vacation Mr Buffett enjoys is elephant hunting — his term for buying up multibillion-dollar companies and adding them to the Berkshire portfolio. And his appetite for a deal in the UK or Europe has not been damped by Brexit. “I’m ready to buy something in the UK tomorrow,” he told the Financial Times, regardless of whether the UK is in or out of the union. “We welcome the chance to put money out any place where we think we understand and sort of trust the system.” DB/Commerz, beginning of the end The will they or won’t they storyline between Germany’s two largest banks that has kept the market hooked for the past six weeks has ended with a definitive they won’t. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have come to the conclusion that a merger would be, well, too complicated.   
  The risks outweigh the benefits for DB, which said in a statement that “a combination with Commerzbank would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the additional execution risks, restructuring costs and capital requirements associated with such a large-scale integration”. One of the many obstacles facing the deal was how many clients would ditch the Frankfurt-based rivals if they became one because the risk of exposure to a merged group would be too high. There was also the issue of the thousands of jobs on the line and the need for €10bn of fresh capital. No one will be more disappointed than the German government, whose hopes of creating a national banking champion have been dashed. Speculators say a big driver behind the merger was Berlin’s wariness of Wall Street dominance in the banking sector.   
  But where one door closes, another opens. With the breakdown of its planned takeover by DB, Commerzbank can look to European suitors who are already waiting in the wings. UniCredit had expressed interest in bidding for Commerzbank if things didn’t work out with DB. The Italian bank could combine it with HypoVereinsbank, the German lender it already owns. There’s also the Dutch bank ING, whose boss Ralph Hamers is keen to engineer a cross-border merger that could include the relocation of ING’s headquarters to Frankfurt. What about DB? It looks like chief executive Christian Sewing wants to go it alone and is preparing a new strategic plan with the aim of convincing investors the company can flourish as a standalone business, people briefed on the discussions said. DB also has a side hustle that’s been overshadowed by the Commerzbank talk. The FT reported earlier this week that the bank’s asset management arm is in serious talks to merge with that of UBS, which would create a new European champion in the investment industry. Whatever happens next, it seems that DB and Commerzbank just weren’t meant to be. You can read the full piece here and Lex’s take here. The bankers advising Occidental and Chevron in the fight for Anadarko On Thursday we told you about Occidental Petroleum’s hostile bid to wrench Anadarko Petroleum from Chevron’s hands. Now we bring you the specialists involved in the $55bn acquisition battle courtesy of DD’s Eric Platt and James Fontanella-Khan. Occidental has shunned the legion of Wall Street’s hostile takeover specialists in favour of their longtime bankers — Bank of America and Citigroup. It’s hardly a surprise. Occidental has close ties with both banks, but particularly with BofA where it has regularly poached high-level talent. Former BofA banker Oscar Brown joined Occidental in 2016 with a mission to help the company’s chief executive Vicki Hollub carry out a transformational deal and likely helped his old employers land the coveted advisory job. But the BofA relationship dates back before Brown when Stephen Chazen led Occidental. He was a managing director at Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by BofA during the financial crisis. If Occidental is successful in its bid, BofA and Citi will be in line for a lucrative payday with fees estimated to reach $170m by Dealogic. Next to Hollub and Brown at the negotiating table are: Patrick Ramsey, the co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at BofA

Purna Saggurti, chairman of global corporate and investment banking at BofA

Brad Hutchinson, co-head of BofA’s Americas energy investment banking department

Stephen Trauber, head of global energy investment banking at Citi

Mark Shafir, global co-head of M&A at Citi

 Chevron is being advised by some of Wall Street’s best-known dealmakers: Greg Weinberger, co-head of global M&A at Credit Suisse

Scott Barshay, a partner and global head of M&A at Paul Weiss

 And at the opposite end of the negotiating table with Anadarko are: Dan Ward, senior managing director at Evercore

Will Hiltz, senior managing director of Evercore’s strategic advisory business

Suhail Sikhtian, head of natural resources at Goldman Sachs

"India’s renewable rush puts coal on the back burner","Investment in the fossil fuel at a standstill as focus switches to green energy","Indian power companies spent much of the past decade rushing to build coal-fired power plants in anticipation of surging electricity demand as economic growth took off. Now, many of those projects are mired in deep financial distress and private investment in coal power has ground to a near halt. The sector has been hit by a host of problems: many plants have struggled to secure fuel supplies, and to clinch deals to sell their power to cash-strapped state distribution companies. But the biggest driver of long-term uncertainty for the industry is one that few anticipated 10 years ago: an explosive take-off in the renewable power sector, as India joins the global push to tackle climate change by shifting towards green energy. Soon after taking power in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government set a target of increasing India’s renewable energy capacity by 2022 to 175 gigawatts, equivalent to 40 per cent of the country’s total power capacity at the time of the announcement.  Mr Modi’s ambitions were stoked by a dramatic fall in the price of solar panels after a huge expansion of production in China, which is seeking to capitalise on the international drive to cut emissions. This was steadily making the cost of electricity from solar plants — once far more expensive than coal power — more competitive with plants running on the dirtiest fossil fuel. In the 2017 financial year, newly added renewable energy capacity overtook new coal-fired capacity for the first time. The renewable push attracted major investors such as Japan’s SoftBank, whose consortium last year sealed a deal that stunned the industry. It agreed to sell power from a northern Indian solar park for Rs2.44 per unit — well below the cost of coal power, which typically costs well over Rs3.  This shift in the industry’s economics means that coal power — once one of the hottest prospects for Indian industrialists — is now a space where most fear to tread. “You’d have to be quite courageous to invest in coal at this point,” said Navroz Dubash of New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research. “The speed with which the story has reversed is quite astonishing.”  India’s move away from coal power has big implications for the global climate. Per capita electricity consumption by the country’s 1.3bn people is just 38 per cent of the global average, according to the New Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute, with tens of millions of households still lacking grid connections, and many more suffering highly inconsistent power supply. The government has made the push for reliable, universally available electricity a key policy priority.  The scale of the anticipated growth in power demand meant that coal would remain a vital part of the power mix, said Sajal Ghosh, an energy economist at Gurgaon’s Management Development Institute. In contrast with its heavy reliance on imported oil and gas, India has plentiful supplies of coal in its eastern region. Until major advances are made in storage, large-scale coal power will be required to make up for the intermittent nature of renewable electricity, with solar plants shutting down at night and wind turbines falling quiet on still days. Indian coal power producers are considering renewable projects when they build new capacity © Getty But the sector is already moving quickly to respond to the rapid shift in the relative economics of coal and renewables. This year, state-run NTPC — by far the biggest thermal power producer in India — has cancelled several plans for large coal projects, including one for a giant 4GW plant in southern Andhra Pradesh state. Increasingly, large private-sector coal power producers are looking at renewable projects when they build new capacity. Adani Power, for example, has invested more than $600m in a solar plant in Tamil Nadu — a southern state with abundant sunshine. There is no longer an economic case for the highest-cost coal plants in inland areas of the country’s south and west, which are forced to rely on coal expensively transported over long distances from the northeastern coalfields, said Tim Buckley at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. But with a huge stock of newly built or under-construction coal plants, the companies are now forced to question which projects will remain viable in an age of increasingly plentiful renewable power, and which may need to be abandoned.  Credit Suisse estimates that more than half the debt owed by power companies is now stressed — with interest payments exceeding profits — amounting to a total of more than Rs2.5tn ($35bn). Several coal-focused power groups are being dealt with under India’s new bankruptcy code, which will force them into liquidation if a swift sale is not agreed.  Indian authorities have an incentive to minimise the distress in the coal power sector. State-controlled banks, reeling from a surge in non-performing corporate loans, are heavily exposed to this industry. A dramatic slowdown in the coal sector “would have its own implications for the banking sector in India”, warned Len George, an energy specialist at the Asian Development Bank. Authorities’ desire to prevent large coal-fired plants from sliding into distress was reflected this month, when the Gujarat government agreed to raise the rates paid for power to two major coal plants run by Adani, Tata Power and Essar Power. The plants had fallen into heavy losses after a change in Indonesian rules increased the cost of their imported coal. “There are a lot of things that would make the government want to prop up coal,” said Mr Dubash at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research. “But the prize you get if you unwind this political economy is lower cost power across the country and more competitive Indian industry.”","01.01.2019"
"Wall Street reacts to a dressed-down Goldman Sachs","‘This is more of a societal change,’ says CEO David Solomon","David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said: 'I can remember going into restaurants and seeing everyone in suit and tie. How many restaurants require a suit and tie anymore?' © Bloomberg When a memo went out to Goldman Sachs staff last week, informing them that formal business attire would no longer be an everyday requirement, chief executive David Solomon was wearing a suit and tie.  This apparent inconsistency is just the point, said the new leader of Wall Street’s best-known investment bank. The business world is in flux, and Goldman has to be fluid in response.  “I know there is a strong desire to connect this to some major change on Wall Street, but this is more of a societal change than a Wall Street change or a Goldman Sachs change,” said Mr Solomon, who succeeded Lloyd Blankfein last year and has worked at Goldman for two decades.  “There are fewer and fewer businesses where people dress formally . . . I grew up outside New York City. I can remember going into restaurants and seeing everyone in suit and tie. How many restaurants require a suit and tie any more?” The memo only gave Goldman’s staff the freedom to “dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients’ expectations”. But even this degree of freedom reflects a transformation in the firm.  A passage from Charles Ellis’s history of Goldman, The Partnership, describes how early in his career, in the years after the second world war, John Whitehead thought he would beat the summer heat by going to work in a light-coloured seersucker suit. Walter Sachs, son of the bank’s co-founder, saw him in a corridor and asked if he worked for the company. Whitehead — who would go on to chair the bank — confessed that he did. “In that case,” came the frosty reply, “I would recommend that you go home right now and change out of your pyjamas.” The fact that you come to work in a sports coat and shirt without a tie shouldn’t affect the way you think about the clientJoe Perella of Perella Weinberg Partners This anecdote alone belies one of the memo’s statements, that “all of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace”. For Mr Solomon, though, not only the world of business has changed, but the structure of the bank, too, with an influx of software engineers and retail bankers. It was time to acknowledge the facts on the ground. “If you’d been walking around Goldman Sachs today, you would have noticed a wide variety of dress . . . we have 10,000 engineers working for us, and we have been building our consumer business, which is a bit of a start-up. This is about leadership looking around the firm and accepting that things have changed.” Wall Street has tried to adjust its dress code before. “This is not the first time round,” says Paulette Garafalo, chief executive of Paul Stuart, a chain of hushed and luxurious clothing stores where Wall Street power brokers are a core customer and off-the-rack suits start at just under $2,000.  An interior display at a Paul Stuart store in New York © Alamy “When I started at Hickey Freeman [another suit maker] in 1998, they told me, just keep doing what we have been doing.” Almost immediately, “everybody announced they were going business casual — Simpson Thacher, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, everybody . . . it was a big scramble; business fell 45 per cent”. The unlikely saviour? Dick Fuld, the ill-fated boss of Lehman Brothers.  “He was the first CEO to say ‘enough’”, and take his bank back to formal business attire, she said. “And slowly but surely they all went back.” Ms Garafalo is not, however, waiting for suit sales to pick up again. Paul Stuart is doing a strong business in soft, unstructured sport coats and more casual trousers. Women professionals, she said, have made the move away from formal suits a few years ago.  Wall Street executives remember the first foray into more relaxed attire with mixed feelings. Bob Diamond, the American former boss of Barclays, recalls that in 1998, during his early days in London, he was heading out of the house, having tried the switch to casual work clothes for the first time. “My wife looked at me and said ‘go back and put your uniform on’ — and I did,” feeling more comfortable as a result. One of the things he liked about his early days as a banker at Morgan Stanley, he says, was that “you knew the rules” — for attire and everything else. Bob Diamond, the American-born former head of Barclays in the UK, said: 'The idea of smart casual is better understood by Americans' © Charlie Bibby/FT Mr Diamond, who now runs private equity funds in New York and London, said the shift away from suit and tie has been even harder for the British and Europeans than for Americans. “For people in the UK, it’s either a suit or a Liverpool [football] jersey — nothing in between. The idea of smart casual is better understood by Americans; a Swiss is more comfortable in a suit.” Robin Rankin, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse, points out that in some cases it is the formality, rather than casual turnout, that puts clients ill at ease. “We are in a client service business, and we meet all kinds of clients,” she said. “Some of them literally say: ‘Don’t wear a suit, we’re not going to let you in if you do. It would create a bad vibe.’ That’s their culture.”  Ms Rankin, who is based in New York, said the challenges of business casual are more acute for women than men. “Guys know it’s chinos and a collared shirt,” she said, while women are left to drift.  Robin Rankin, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse in New York, said: 'Guys know it’s chinos and a collared shirt' while women are left to drift  A managing director at a mid-market investment bank agrees that for women, having more options is worse, not better. “Chinos, button-down shirt, fleece vest — the ‘midtown uniform’ — the equivalent for women is — what?”  Often women have to err on the side of formality. “It is hard in this industry historically for women to be taken seriously, so it is safer to go on the side of being more formal.” Women risk going too far towards formality, and being taken less seriously for that, she said. A male partner at one of the big Wall Street law firms, who practises in Europe, sees an irony here. “Some of those clients who do seem to care about dress — young tech/start-up/Silicon Valley hipster types — are the ones who purport to care less. If you go to a meeting with that audience, you risk alienation in a business suit.” I don’t think the dress code issue correlates to anything . . . how people think is not affected by a dress code Roger Altman, founder of Evercore And a casual dress code creates risks of its own. The law partner recalled being invited to a work event described as “business casual” with potential clients from Latin America. “Everyone to the man was in a dark suit and tie, in the blaring heat of Miami. I was in light coloured slacks and dress shirt with rolled up sleeves, and I looked and felt like a guy on safari — haven’t made that mistake twice.” These days he sticks to suits. The most important question is whether a casual attitude towards clothes reflects a casual attitude towards clients. Roger Altman, founder and senior chairman of the boutique investment bank Evercore, bristles at the very notion. “I don’t think the dress code issue correlates to anything . . . how people think is not affected by a dress code.” At Evercore, dress is left to individual judgment.  Likewise, Mr Solomon, who lets off steam by doing a spot of DJ-ing at weekends, rejects out of hand the idea that sloppy dress leads to sloppy work. “You can’t draw a correlation to business performance and market cap growth to formalness of dress.” David Solomon, who occasionally DJs at weekends, said: 'This is about leadership looking around the firm and accepting that things have changed' © Reuters Yet at one time, the idea that sloppy dress led to sloppy work was almost undisputed. Joe Perella of Perella Weinberg Partners, the boutique investment bank, whose Wall Street career spans nearly five decades, looks back on those days with evident warmth. He recalls an early job at an accountancy firm where one partner insisted that, when visiting a client’s office for an audit, everyone on the audit team arrived in a hat. Those without were sent home to get one. An early boss at First Boston would tell any employee looking shaggy ahead of a client visit to go get a haircut.  There was a good reason for the strict attitude to appearance. “The client was the centre of the universe in those days. Everybody was there to make a living, the firms were much smaller . . . 95 per cent of the firms were partnerships and the partners’ assets were on the line every day.” As a result “you had self-regulation — built in governance because they were playing with their own money”.  That is the ethic he has tried to instil at Perella Weinberg — but even there, the days of mandated hats and haircuts are long gone. “The fact that you come to work in a sports coat and shirt without a tie shouldn’t affect the way you think about the client.” Not everyone is certain that an old fashioned focus on the customer can survive in casual clothes. One senior banker at a prominent boutique recalls sitting on a promotion committee, considering an intelligent candidate for managing director, who was known for unkempt hair and a certain untidiness.  Even though he pulled himself together for big meetings, “what kept coming up was: is this someone that — tomorrow — you would put in front of clients? Someone you would grab and say ‘we need you for a meeting in two hours’?”  The promotion went to someone else.

"Stocks to watch: ITV, Ryanair, EnQuest, Wm Morrison, Sika, Ubisoft","5G auction costs make Vodafone’s dividend unsustainable, says RBC","Tuesday 14:00 GMT What’s happening ● SIG led the FTSE 250 fallers after a full-year update from the insulation supplier missed expectations because of a further deterioration in mainland European trading.  Like-for-like sales in France and Germany were down sharply in the last two months of 2018 while UK and Irish sales remained subdued, SIG said. It guided for £75m full-year earnings, at the bottom of its previous range of £75m to £80m but also included up to £3m of property profits.  “The outlook for volumes remains patchy at best given the economic and political uncertainty in a number of markets. On the flip side, management has delivered much better gross margins (by increasing prices and jettisoning low margin customers) as well as returning overheads to where they were three to four years ago. A full year of these benefits will be seen in 2019. So while we are lowering our top-end forecasts by 4 per cent, we don’t see much change to consensus.”Peel Hunt ● Wm Morrison retreated after its Christmas period trading update showed 3.6 per cent like-for-like sales growth excluding fuel, against a consensus expecting 4.1 per cent. Management left full-year guidance unchanged but cautioned on a conference call that consumer confidence had weakened. Separately, Kantar Worldpanel’s supermarket survey for December showed industry sales up 1.2 per cent. Tesco was the best performer among the big four with 1.7 per cent sales growth, while J Sainsbury was the laggard with sales down 1.2 per cent. “It’s safe to say that volume trends at Morrisons supermarkets are challenging. In good part, a cautious consumer is to blame it seems and according to Kantar market share data, Morrisons hasn’t seen a major deterioration in relative momentum.”Exane ● Sika of Switzerland slipped after a 2018 guidance cut overshadowed its SFr2.5bn purchase of French mortar manufacturer Parex. The chemicals maker blamed one-off merger costs and higher than expected raw material inflation for 2018 earnings coming in at between SFr940m and SFr960m, compared with a market consensus of SFr997m. Sellside stories ● RBC downgraded Vodafone to “underperform” from “outperform” with a 125p price target, cut from 260p. Debt to fund Vodafone’s €18bn deal to buy divisions from Liberty Global leaves the group with “insufficient financial headroom” to cope with headwinds including 5G spectrum auction costs and competition from an entrant in Germany, RBC said.  “Vodafone’s frenetic portfolio restructuring has left the company more European and converged, but also vulnerable. Its underlying markets remain ‘challenging’ and it has very little financial headroom despite synergies and cost cutting. Vodafone has options with its towers but faces a threat from 5G spectrum. The dividend is unsustainable even before we consider a macro downturn.”RBC With 5G spectrum licences likely to cost from €4.5bn to €12bn, Vodafone’s €4.1bn per-year dividend cost looks unsustainable beyond the March 2019 year-end, said RBC. And while Vodafone will probably sell a minority stake in its mobile towers business, the likely proceeds of around €4.3bn would only fund one year’s dividend at the current payout, it added.  ● Berenberg downgraded Ryanair to “sell” from “hold” in a transport and logistics sector review. Ryanair “faces sustained competitive pressure to pricing, while its cost progress remains highly uncertain”, it said.  European short-haul capacity looks set to increase 7.5 per cent this year as industry optimism and low financing costs increase the risk of overcapacity, said Berenberg. It forecast fares to weaken in 2019 and advised selling EasyJet, but kept Wizz Air on a “buy” rating, citing its “unique ability to fight unit revenue pressure and further grind down unit costs”. ● Liberum repeated “buy” advice on ITV with a 260p target price in response to news on Monday that STV, the Scottish licence holder for its flagship channel, had signed a five-year deal to put programmes on Sky’s video-on-demand services. Sky, whose current deal with ITV expires this year, has so far resisted offering retransmission fees. STV’s agreement with Sky “has been worded with no explicit reference for fees for ITV1 but with an implicit recognition it is included”, said Liberum. This “is a pointer to a deal between ITV and Sky on retransmission fees, which we believe would lead to a material (circa 15 per cent) uplift on consensus earnings”, it said.  ● RBC corrected a note released on Monday on EnQuest, which stated that the North Sea oil explorer was at risk of breaching banking covenants. RBC said it had wrongly identified the required covenant ratios and said there was no risk of a breach under its current oil price assumptions. But RBC repeated its downgrade of EnQuest to “underperform” from “outperform” with a 15p target price.   ● In brief: ABB upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Aker Solutions upgraded to “outperform” at Bernstein; Bankia raised to “hold” at Jefferies; Bouygues downgraded to “neutral” at Credit Suisse; Capital & Counties upgraded to “add” at Peel Hunt; Carnival raised to “buy” at Shore Capital; Carrefour upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Duerr downgraded to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; Electrocomponents raised to “buy” at Jefferies and UBS; Geberit downgraded to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Grafton upgraded to “buy” at Canaccord; Grenke downgraded to “hold” at Berenberg; Footasylum cut to “hold” at Liberum; Keywords Studios raised to “outperform” at Davy; Kion downgraded to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Legrand cut to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Mapfre cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Marshalls downgraded to “hold” at Canaccord; Metso upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Outotec upgraded to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Petrofac upgraded to “market perform” at Bernstein; Prysmian raised to “buy” at Goldman Sachs; Rotork upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; SMCP upgraded to “buy” at Jefferies; Sandvik raised to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Schneider downgraded to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch and cut to “sell” at Goldman Sachs; Signify downgraded to “neutral” at Merrill Lynch; Smiths cut to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch; Storebrand upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Swiss Life upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Telia cut to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Ubisoft raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Unipol downgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Vesuvius upgraded to “buy” at Merrill Lynch; Wartsila downgraded to “underperform” at Merrill Lynch.

"Major themes set to shape markets in 2019","From gloomy bonds to a renminbi wild card, our pick of the key issues for the coming year","A punishing December capped a year investors will be keen to forget, when almost every major asset class fell. The volatility that marked 2018 sets up some key conundrums facing markets in 2019.  Is the US bond market too pessimistic? The 10-year US government bond yield is arguably the most widely watched and influential interest rate in the world, and the market turbulence of 2018 shows that investors are acutely sensitive to its movements. As last year drew to a close, the $14tn market staged a robust rally, cramming down yields as fixed-income investors began to anticipate a US economy coming down from the stimulus-induced high. Despite the sharp move down in yields in November and December, which sent the 10-year yield as low as 2.72 per cent, Wall Street analysts on average expect the yield to end 2019 at 3.44 per cent, according to a Bloomberg survey. For those who believe the pessimism that gripped markets towards the end of last year is overdone, it is a forecast that might just seem reasonable.   If that scenario unfolds, it is likely to further energise the dollar as more money chases the higher returns available on US assets, and deal a blow to emerging market bonds and equities. However, the forecasts of Wall Street strategists for bond prices have proved consistently too bearish in recent years. Some believe the bond market is right to anticipate a much more sluggish US economy, arguing that after delivering four interest rate increases in 2018, the Federal Reserve may now be finished. For them, the more pressing question is whether the US yield curve inverts — a historically reliable indicator of a recession that occurs when short-term bond yields rise above those for longer-dated bonds. “We do not actually expect the curve to invert in 2019, not least because the Fed is itself likely to regard a flatter curve as a warning sign,” analysts at Credit Suisse note. The meeting of Fed policymakers in late January will be a key early date in the calendar. How will European markets cope with the end of QE? While the US Treasury market will do much to set the direction for other sovereign bonds, the outlook for European government debt will also be shaped by the European Central Bank’s decision to end the multitrillion euro bond-buying programme that it began in 2015. As the ECB’s purchases helped depress yields, the absence of such a large buyer should logically exert some upward pressure. But some are sceptical that yields for some eurozone countries will climb significantly. For a start, the ECB will continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing debt that it already owns — meaning its portfolio will remain at about the current €2.6tn level. The largely balanced fiscal position in some core eurozone countries, notably Germany, offers another potential countervailing force to the ECB’s absence as there will be a limited new supply of debt for investors to digest. “Overall the reinvestment programme will remain supportive for European bond yields because the scarcity issue is not going to disappear soon for core bonds,” said Michael Grady, head of investment strategy at Aviva Investors.  For European fixed-income investors, much will depend on the performance of the eurozone economy, which disappointed last year after a surprisingly upbeat 2017. Should global trade tensions, a messy Brexit or a deterioration in relations between Italy’s populist government and Brussels scupper economists’ expectations for a rebound, then catalysts for a move higher in German yields becomes even harder to find. However, a sluggish eurozone economy could yet feed into a potentially different dynamic for countries such as Italy, which has substantial amounts of fresh debt to sell after being at loggerheads with Brussels for much of last year over its spending plans. Bond investors could also be challenged by May’s European Parliament elections in which voters have thrown their support behind parties pushing expansionary fiscal policies. “Centrist politicians are still struggling to head off populist parties,” said Karen Ward at JPMorgan Asset Management. Will there be a ‘last hurrah’ for US stocks? The last year for US stocks was bookended by a melt-up and a near meltdown. As 2019 starts, a key question for investors is whether US stocks have already seen their peak for this economic cycle. Even if the answer is yes, it begs the question of whether the market will still see a bounce in the first quarter that will be painful for fund managers to miss.  Equity strategists at Barclays say they see two scenarios. Their base case is a “last hurrah [for equities] followed by an eventual sell-off as recession hits after two years”, but there is “an alternative scenario where equities have already peaked and will continue drifting down as they have done historically a year before recession starts”.  The macro risks are multiple and well-known: the Fed stalls the economy by raising rates too high, Beijing and Washington’s temporary trade truce unravels or cooler growth outside the US saps corporate profits. David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management, said these will prove relevant if they affect what really matters: corporate earnings growth. Wall Street analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to grow 8.3 per cent in 2019 (as measured by earnings per share), down from an expected 20.5 per cent in 2018, according to FactSet. And for analysts at JPMorgan, for example, that order of profit growth will help send the S&P 500 up 15 per cent in 2019, as fears of a buckling US economy prove overblown.  A similar debate is animating the corporate bond market, where investors in both US investment-grade and high-yield bonds nursed losses in 2018. Some fund managers already see opportunities. “It’s a substantial increase in yields,” said Ed Perks, chief investment officer for multi-asset solutions at Franklin Templeton. “If you subscribe to the idea that the backdrop remains conducive for corporate fundamentals, it’s pretty attractive.” Will China’s renminbi extend its slide? The performance of the Chinese renminbi remains a wild card for global investors. Those who believe the official GDP figures are overstating the strength of the economy believe Beijing will in the end let the renminbi fall further in 2019.   Raymond Ma, a fund manager at Fidelity International, said that possibility would also keep the Chinese stock market — the worst performing major stock market in 2018 — on edge. Whether Beijing and Washington can reach an agreement that holds on trade will also be central to the renminbi’s fate. It is worth noting that while the broad consensus among foreign exchange strategists is that the dollar will falter in 2019 as monetary policy begins to shift in favour of other currencies such as the euro, many do not expect that weakness to come against the renminbi. 2018: four lessons from the markets  Reporting by Robin Wigglesworth, Joe Rennison, Nicole Bullock, Kate Allen and Emma Dunkley

The retailer blamed a mild winter for holding back auto parts sales and said poor consumer confidence had affected demand for big-ticket items.  Its earnings range for the fiscal year ending March was £58m-£62m, compared with a consensus of about £70m, and management said not to expect a recovery next year. Halfords had previously guided for flat year-on-year profits next year. Halfords’ implied cut to year-end 2020 profit “poses some very serious fundamental questions”, said Peel Hunt, which repeated “sell” advice. “Of course, it’s hard to have visibility on consumer behaviour right now, but car maintenance (the really profitable bit) is extremely defensive and should bounce straight back given normal weather . . .

The broker’s survey found 48 per cent of US consumers used Twitter, up from 44 per cent in mid-2018. It was also encouraged that 9 per cent of respondents expected to use Twitter more next year, up from 6 per cent in the previous survey, and saw evidence that the social media site had more capacity than rivals to increase advertising volumes.  Merrill found 96 per cent of US consumers used Google, 86 per cent used Facebook and 43 per cent used Snapchat. Instagram showed the biggest improvement compared with its previous survey, with penetration increasing to 60 per cent from 53 per cent as users switched from parent brand Facebook. ● Berenberg downgraded Burberry and Prada to “hold” from “buy” in its 2019 luxury goods sector preview. Sector valuations, while in line with historical averages at 20 times forward earnings, were unlikely to expand much given macro uncertainties so investors should become more defensive, the broker said.   Companies were structurally better prepared than in 2012 for a China downturn and the underlying drivers of consumption were healthier, “allowing for long-term sustainable mid-single-digit growth as the sector enters a period of normalisation in demand”, Berenberg said. However, it saw turnround stories falling out of favour as normalised valuations left little room for error. As well as the Burberry and Prada downgrades, the broker moved to “sell” from “hold” on Tod’s.   Berenberg kept “buy” advice on LVMH and Kering, saying: “While dealmaking in the luxury space continues to be opportunistic, we believe that the significant balance-sheet firepower of the two largest conglomerates in our coverage (an estimated €25bn for LVMH and €10bn for Kering)  . . . constitutes an upside risk for the investors — either in the form of value-accretive acquisitions or returns to shareholders.”  ● UBS downgraded Merlin Entertainments to “sell” from “neutral” based on lukewarm customer reviews for its Midway city attractions. It put a 295p target on the theme park operator. UBS found that the average satisfaction score across Merlin’s Midway portfolio had fallen year-on-year with meaningful declines for London Eye and Madame Tussauds London and a disappointing start for the newly launched Little Big City, which offers visitors miniature replicas of iconic buildings. It said: “The performance of core London sites is of particular importance given they account for circa 35 per cent of profits but just 5 per cent of sites. As such declining reviews and hence attendance could have a disproportionate effect on Midway profitability.”  The broker also noted that, while Legoland remained a strong brand with clear rollout potential, like-for-like growth slowed in 2018 and feedback on its Windsor site had deteriorated. The low scores across the group “could be the result of poor investment or operational decisions, with cost cutting and a focus on new business development potentially leaving the core profit drivers of Midway under resourced”, UBS added. “If our data is a leading indicator of site performance, it suggests further weakness in 2019.”  ● JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded Umicore and Air Liquide to “neutral” and “underweight” respectively as part of a European chemicals sector review. Lanxess and BASF were both raised to “overweight”.  Recent economic data “suggest a difficult 2019 for the sector, on average, with likely further material cuts to consensus”, said JPMorgan. “However, this is now reflected to a large extent in the recent significant sector correction and some stocks have corrected/de-rated from the peak by almost as much or even more than was seen in past major corrections, including during recessions. Strong balance sheets, on average, combined with the recent significant derating, might again stimulate increased M&A activity.” If end-market demand stabilised, stocks including BASF and Lanxess look attractive but the risks to 2019 earnings were not fully reflected in Umicore’s premium valuation, said JPMorgan. It also downgraded Wacker Chemie and Clariant to “underweight” and restarted coverage of Akzo Nobel with the same rating, all on valuation grounds. ● Jefferies downgraded Ted Baker to “hold” from “buy” following Wednesday’s better than expected trading update from the fashion label.  “Ted’s impressive 12.2 per cent Christmas sales [growth] shows that customers have not been put off by coverage of the conduct issues currently being investigated. It did, however, cost gross margin and, with Brexit still to come, management remains understandably cautious. [With] the stock up circa 35 per cent since we upgraded in December, we believe Ted offers a more balanced risk/reward.”Jefferies Goldman Sachs also downgraded Ted Baker to “neutral” from “buy” on valuation grounds. Its £21.50 target price equated to 14.8 times 2021 earnings.  ● In brief: 
Aker BP upgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Autoliv raised to “buy” at UBS; Avast rated “neutral” at JPMorgan; BBA Aviation upgraded to “buy” at Jefferies; Continental cut to “neutral” at UBS; Cranswick raised to “buy” at Liberum; Domino’s Pizza raised to “neutral” at UBS; DNO rated “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Eutelsat raised to “overweight” at Morgan Stanley; EnQuest cut to “hold” at Canaccord and cut to “underweight” at Barclays; Faurecia cut to “sell” at UBS; Faroe Petroleum downgraded to “hold” at Canaccord and Cantor; Gecina upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Gym Group downgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Hurricane Energy upgraded to “buy” at Canaccord; Icade upgraded to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; InterContinental Hotels raised to “neutral” at UBS; International Petroleum raised to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Kering cut to “neutral” at UBS; Lundin Petroleum rated “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Mitchells & Butlers upgraded to “hold” at Liberum; PGS upgraded to “buy” at Handelsbanken; Plastic Omnium raised to “buy” at UBS; Polymetal cut to “hold” at Renaissance Capital; Safran downgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; SSE rated “outperform” at Credit Suisse; Sound Energy rated “neutral” at Macquarie; Swedbank upgraded to “buy” at Deutsche Bank; Swedish Match upgraded to “outperform” at Bernstein; Tullow downgraded to “equal-weight” at Barclays; UBS downgraded to “hold” at Société Générale.

"WhatsApp’s push into mobile payments","Messaging app owned by Facebook builds business model on money transfers","For 34-year-old Dipti Vartak, a home baker in Mumbai, WhatsApp is both the quickest way to take orders from her customers and now also the easiest way to take their payments. Since May last year, she has been one of a million Indians testing out a new payments function in the messaging app, which is owned by Facebook.  She was already running a lot of her business through the app, exchanging bills, receipts and payment confirmations with customers and suppliers. She saved her bank details, and found she could simply message anybody with the amount to be transferred.  
WhatsApp Pay, which is facilitated by the Indian government’s secure UPI payments system, transfers funds directly between users’ bank accounts, in real time.  “It has really reduced the friction. I just tell people to WhatsApp me, which is easier for them than carrying exact change, too,” she said, adding that about 15 of her customers were paying her through WhatsApp regularly and that she had taken about Rs25,000 ($356) through the platform in six months.  For WhatsApp, and Facebook, the payments trial in India is the first step towards tapping a hugely valuable new channel of data: how people are spending their money.  Since WhatsApp began testing its payments feature in February last year, it has processed about a million transactions a month, according to people close to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella organisation for all payments and settlements companies. WhatsApp declined to comment on the figure.  The company has run into headwinds as it tries to extend the service nationwide, with regulators demanding that its payments data be processed in India, rather than on Facebook’s servers in California. Despite several meetings between Chris Daniels, WhatsApp’s chief executive, and India’s central bank governor since early 2018, the two are in a stalemate that has lasted all year.  India is WhatsApp’s biggest market by far, with 210m monthly users, and the company has hired Abhijit Bose from Ezetap, a Bangalore-based payments platform, as its new country chief. It is also advertising for a head of policy to ease relations with the incoming governor of the Indian central bank.  During the deadlock, Google has launched its own payments service, and Facebook’s leadership has floated the idea of launching WhatsApp payments in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, the app’s second-largest market.  “I think it’s safe to say it’s pretty important for us to launch payments in India,” said one person close to WhatsApp.  The economic opportunity for mobile payments in India is huge: there are more than 1bn mobile phone users in the country, and the digital payments market, led by mobile, will grow to $1tn by 2023, according to a report by Credit Suisse. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed 86 per cent of India’s cash from circulation in November 2016, Indian mobile wallet company Paytm was one of the big winners. The company added 20m users in just five weeks after the shock announcement.  But just a month later, Mr Modi was urging citizens to use UPI — a groundbreaking payments system that presented a threat to Paytm. Created by the NPCI, a joint venture among Indian banks, the technology dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for payments app developers.  It also removed the need for consumers to keep money in a separate virtual wallet, as with Paytm’s main service or with Alipay and WeChat Pay in China. Google was the first big foreign company to jump on the UPI platform, launching its payments app Tez in September 2017. It claims to have amassed 16m users, helping to spur rapid growth in UPI transactions, which reached $2.8bn in February — compared with $534m using Paytm’s virtual wallet and other prepaid instruments.  But analysts say WhatsApp will be a bigger threat to Paytm and others entering the payments business. “Based on my knowledge of the payments system in India over the last 10 years, WhatsApp Pay will be viral,” said Ram Rastogi, an architect of the UPI system in India, and former employee of the NPCI.  “Indians want something they are used to, in a language they can read and write in. WhatsApp’s willingness to provide services in 13 major languages in India can play a vital role in taking digitisation of payments even to villages.” Last month, UPI facilitated 520m transactions, a figure growing by 10 per cent each month.  “Within six months of full launch, WhatsApp can easily reach 100m to 150m monthly transactions, which is a similar rate to what Google has seen here,” Mr Rastogi said. The average value of a transaction via UPI is Rs1,000, which could add up to Rs150bn ($2bn) flowing through WhatsApp every month.  The company has insisted that it does not have plans to take a cut of transactions from banks, but every bank that connects to WhatsApp via UPI is obliged to pay a flat fee of Rs0.5 to Rs1.5 per transaction for peer-to-peer transactions, according to UPI rules.  “Two-hundred million people with WhatsApp connections means that even one transaction a day will give them Rs100m daily,” Mr Rastogi said. “The other thing is once you do this volume of transactions, you can start analysing transactions. That’s the big opportunity.”  This trove of payments data could help Facebook and WhatsApp raise the fees they charged to advertisers, analysts said. 
 “If they see who you’re paying, it helps them to target your ads, so it makes you much more valuable to their advertisers,” said David Birch, director of payments consultancy Hyperion, and a digital money analyst.  “If WhatsApp can see that you’re paying a gym once a month, that data could be used by Facebook to target you across its other platforms. Also, if I see you’re spending a lot, I can start targeting you with direct messages from financial services, which makes you more valuable, too.”  Companies with large amounts of user transaction data could also start providing lateral services. “They could make basic services like transferring money internationally free overnight, as a way to grow loyalty and access ever more data,” said Mark Tluszcz, chief executive of Mangrove Capital Partners, a venture capital company based in Luxembourg. Over the past year, Facebook has aggressively started to monetise its chat apps, such as Messenger, through ads. It also sells access to its interface to big brands on both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which it acquired for $21.8bn in 2014.  In India, WhatsApp is already charging large businesses such as airlines and ecommerce sites a fixed rate of between 0.5 and 9 US cents per message, a premium to SMS, to contact customers through WhatsApp.  Although WhatsApp Pay is pitched as a peer-to-peer payments system, more than 80 per cent of small businesses in India and Brazil say they already use WhatsApp to conduct business. Facilitating retail payments via the app is an obvious next step, a source close to WhatsApp acknowledged. “Today, almost 1m people are testing WhatsApp payments in India. The feedback has been very positive, and people enjoy the convenience of sending money as simply and securely as sending messages,” said Anne Yeh from WhatsApp. “We’re working closely with the Indian government, NPCI and multiple banks, including our payment service providers, to . . . support India’s digital economy.”  Additional reporting by Simon Mundy

"The K and the R of KKR sit down with the FT","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. The two remaining founders of KKR, Henry Kravis (right) and George Roberts (left), spent an hour with the Financial Times in Tokyo last week chewing over their view of the world, the state of private equity, the Brexit risk and other issues.   
  The duo, who are cousins, were in town for the annual get-together of KKR partners. The event marked the first time that they’ve held the gathering in Asia. There was, it quickly turned out, significance in that. Japan, said the two veterans of some of the greatest PE derring-do of the past four decades, is now KKR’s “highest priority” outside the US. They’d be using, they said, the 70s and 80s playbook from when the mightiest US conglomerates were shedding non-core assets — a process they now expect the likes of Hitachi, Toshiba and Panasonic to get stuck into as activism becomes more successful and companies acknowledge their obligations to shareholders. KKR’s dealmaking prowess in the 80s was captured in the legendary business book, Barbarians at the Gate. More on this lower down*.   
  For a market that non-Japanese stock investors have been underweight for more than a year now, that made quite the statement — particularly when Roberts followed it up by saying that he was actually “more comfortable” with Japan than China as matters stand. Asked to explain a bit further, the two men, who come to these conversations armed with some first-rate anecdotes (including descriptions of exasperated attempts to explain private equity to VIPs on the political world stage who should really know by now), said that Japan was now totally different from when they set up KKR’s Japan office a little over a decade ago. Some 10 years earlier, said Kravis, he met a chief executive at a Japanese company who proudly told him it had 2,000 subsidiaries. All 2,000 of them, he was told, were core to the company. But nobody says that sort of thing in Japan any more — an observation that’s been made by pretty much every M&A banker, lawyer and PE group eagerly looking at Japan over the past couple of years. The K and the R of KKR clearly had their differences over Brexit, with Roberts optimistic that a hard Brexit and a weakened sterling would create opportunities for PE. Kravis, in what appeared to be in agreement with KKR’s European team, takes a less upbeat view on the prospects Read the story by FT editor Lionel Barber and our Tokyo team of Leo Lewis and Kana Inagaki here.

Investment banking was the only one of Goldman’s six main business areas to post an increase in revenues for the fourth quarter, and Goldman chief executive David Solomon (pictured below), himself latterly head of that division, took obvious glee in telling analysts that Goldman is topping 2019’s year-to-date league tables for M&A, equity capital markets and common stock offerings.   
  The IB results were a bright spot in a quarter where the bank revealed a 21 per cent drop in net earnings compared with the same period a year earlier. Shares in Goldman fell 3.8 per cent to $199.91, as a much anticipated strategic update from Solomon was delayed until next year. Goldman’s surge up the league tables has been helped by a strategy to broaden its client base that was launched in 2017 to some eyebrow-raising from Goldman insiders, who saw their place as advising masters of the universe, not helping mid-cap companies do deals for a couple of billion dollars. Stephen Scherr, chief financial officer, said that Goldman had hired more than 40 bankers for that client diversification effort, and added coverage of 1,000 clients. Success, of course, begets success. While Goldman’s overall headcount fell by 700 in the three months to the end of March, it is creating a new team of 100 or so bankers who will be dedicated to serving smaller clients with enterprise value below $2bn. Goldman investment bankers needn’t fret over their pay either. Even though the bank cut compensation expenses by 20 per cent in the first quarter relative to the year earlier, Scherr told analysts that there had been no change in pay policy. That means that a great proportion of the bonus pool will be accrued later in the year. M&A bankers can expect to do particularly well. Goldman’s financial advisory fees surged 51 per cent to nearly $900m in the first quarter versus a year earlier, way better than the 12 per cent rise at JPMorgan’s advisory revenues for the same period (which came in at $644m).   
  Rivals hoping to put a dent in the Goldman franchise will have to keep trying. Bankers across New York were left wondering how Goldman had missed one of the most lucrative assignments of the year when Bristol-Myers Squibb announced its $90bn takeover of Celgene and GS was nowhere to be found. Had rivals at Evercore, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Citi really cracked the code? Maybe . . . But less than four months later, Goldman is back at the top of the M&A league table, thanks to Chevron’s $50bn takeover of Anadarko, Fidelity National Information Services’s $43bn buyout of Worldpay and US regional bank BB&T’s $28bn purchase of SunTrust. For now, JPM has to console itself with second place. Four takeaways from Chevron’s $50bn takeover of Anadarko 1. Start by reading the latest edition of the FT’s Energy Source briefing here

 Ed Crooks, US energy and industry editor, has been following the oil sector for years. His main takeaway is that Chevron’s planned $50bn acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum will accelerate the process of the shale industry being absorbed into Big Oil and that there are fundamental financial reasons why we can expect that trend to continue. Smaller independent oil companies are under strain to invest in their own businesses as oil prices remain subdued. That means that the world’s biggest oil companies have an opportunity to snap up decent assets on the cheap, while using their scale to keep costs under control.     
  2. Could rival Occidental Petroleum really mount a bid to top Chevron?
 Occidental has a market cap of $47bn, which is dwarfed by Chevron’s $227bn equity valuation. That effectively rules out a bidding war, especially as Anadarko opted to accept a lower offer from Chevron rather than take Occidental’s bid, which was deemed riskier.   Then Occidental must convince its shareholders the deal is in their favour. The share price reaction shows there’d be some opposition (OXY is down 6 per cent since the news leaked) so it would need to limit the amount of its shares it offers as part of the deal to avoid a shareholder vote. That means it must use more cash as part of its bid. And therein lies the problem. There’s only so much debt you can hoist on Occidental’s balance sheet before it crashes out of investment grade territory. 3. Who will buy or be bought next?
 ExxonMobil is the most likely buyer out there. Why? If you go by the theory that independent shale companies are struggling to stay in business and only Big Oil can consolidate, the remaining options are essentially Exxon or a big European player like Total or Royal Dutch Shell. Who might be bought? Pioneer Natural Resources, Concho Resources and Endeavor Energy Resources are all under observation. 4. Will investors start betting on shale’s revival?
 Chevron thinks so, that’s why it just agreed to spend $50bn to buy Anadarko. But there are reasons to remain sceptical. Investors have been frustrated for some time with most US exploration and production companies as they’ve struggled to generate sustained free cash flows from their shale operations. The S&P oil and gas exploration and production industry select index has dropped about 60 per cent from its peak in June. Although Chevron’s endorsement for the industry will be welcomed, it’s unlikely to change the mood among investors dramatically as the industry’s fundamentals (low energy prices) remain unchanged.

"The GAMble and scandal that rattled a $130bn money manager","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One thing to start: Inmarsat revealed last night that it is in $3.3bn talks to be acquired by an investor group led by Apax and Warburg Pincus. The sides have been holding talks for some time and this feels like the end for Inmarsat unless there’s another bidder. More here. On to the show . . .    
  While Londoners were basking under one of the hottest English summers on record, the heat was being turned up at GAM Holding’s plush King Street offices in the city’s St James’s district. Executives at the $130bn Swiss asset manager were struggling with how to handle a bitter internal dispute that eventually would lead to the departure of the group’s chief executive, Alexander Friedman, and one of its star bond fund managers, Tim Haywood. The story behind the crisis is the focus of this big read by the FT’s Laurence Fletcher, who has unearthed some of the details of what really went on.   
  While Haywood was travelling across continents on a financier’s private plane and attending a performance by Monteverdi Choir and Orchestras at Buckingham Palace, his closest colleague, Daniel Sheard, was getting nervous about the nature of Haywood’s business relationships. Most fund managers will tell you that diversification is key, but Haywood seemed to be providing financing for a string of projects related to an Indian-born industrialist, Sanjeev Gupta, who has featured in previous reporting. The deals were arranged by a former adviser to David Cameron when he was UK prime minister and private plane owner Lex Greensill.   
  As events reached a climax in July 2018, GAM announced it had suspended Haywood, who ran more than SFr14bn, with little explanation. Investors panicked and pulled money out of the funds. Days later, the company made another announcement saying it had suspended the funds before later liquidating them. An August statement by the company raised far more questions than it answered. Haywood had allegedly failed to do enough due diligence, had breached the gifts and entertainment policy and used his personal email for work. And little clarity has been offered since, bar a declaration that Haywood was fired for “gross misconduct”, which he disputes; Haywood has vowed to “clear my name”. Dig deeper into the tale by going here. The battle for control of Le Monde Inside the glass-panelled Paris headquarters of Le Monde, journalists are battling to prevent a Czech energy billionaire from wresting control of France’s iconic newspaper. The deal designed to block Daniel Kretinsky is in the final stages of negotiations and follows months of discussions between shareholders, the publisher, and editorial representatives, Le Monde officials told DD’s Harriet Agnew in Paris.   
  The saga involves two of the most prominent figures in French business: Lazard banker Matthieu Pigasse, who unexpectedly sold 49 per cent of his stake in the paper’s publisher to Kretinsky in October, and telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel, who bought a controlling stake in Le Monde in 2010, alongside Pigasse and the late French businessman Pierre Bergé. Pigasse’s sale of slightly less than half of his stake to Kretinsky — making about €50m from the disposal — has strained relations between him and Niel, who believes it was against the spirit of an investment designed to support a free press rather than to make money. And journalists at Le Monde have their own concerns about their new shareholder, which you can read about here. Meanwhile, Niel is also enduring tough times at Iliad, the telecoms company that he controls. AB InBev guard changes signal break with 3G Capital There are major changes brewing at the board of Anheuser-Busch InBev. The beer giant is set to appoint Martin Barrington, the former chief executive of Marlboro maker Altria, as its new chairman. He replaces Olivier Goudet, who the Financial Times previously reported was stepping down due to conflict of interest concerns with his role at investment group JAB Holdings.   
  Barrington’s appointment raises some interesting questions about the board’s already limited independence, which we detail in our report. Perhaps more importantly, 3G Capital managing partner and Kraft Heinz chairman Alexandre Behring is also on his way out of the door, signalling a break with the Brazilian-backed private equity group that has built a reputation on its debt-fuelled dealmaking and aggressive cost-cutting. DD predicted that Goudet’s departure would bring an end to the cosy ties formed between JAB and Brazilian-backed 3G Capital, whose founders orchestrated the deals that created the world’s largest brewer. The shake-up comes after the implosion at packaged foodmaker Kraft Heinz has landed squarely on 3G’s shoulders, prompting investors to question the group’s cost-cutting ways. Kraft Heinz defended its methods in interviews with the DD’s James Fontanella-Khan and Alistair Gray, saying budget-trimming is just the first step that comes after a takeover, whereas the second phase focuses more on investment and expansion. Meanwhile, AB InBev is struggling with a $100bn debt hangover that was racked up from acquisitions while tackling slowing demand for beer in its biggest market, the US. The company risks falling prey to the same issues as Kraft if it doesn’t adapt to changing consumer tastes towards craft and super-premium beer. 3G’s influence is also being slightly watered down by the departure of Carlos Alberto da Veiga Sicupira, a Brazilian billionaire who is one of the private equity firm’s founders. He’ll be replaced by his daughter, Cecilia Sicupira. JAB jostles for control of Coty Say what you will about JAB Holding: it is putting its money (up to $1.75bn worth) where its mouth is with a pending tender offer to take back majority control of flailing cosmetics company Coty.   
  The FT’s Leila Abboud writes that this will either prove to be a masterstroke — if the newly installed management can turn things round, despite rapid change hitting the make-up industry — or an embarrassing error, if they can’t. Tuesday’s SEC filings revealed the back and forth between JAB managing partner Olivier Goudet and Coty’s board as the latter tried to protect minorities from the investment vehicle’s appetites. Lots of interesting titbits in there and one elephant in the room: JAB cannily timed its tender soon after new management took over, but before chief executive Pierre Laubies unveiled a new strategic plan this summer. So how much are Coty shares really worth? Anybody’s guess, but JAB’s guess might be better than yours. Job moves DD scoop: Jonathan Slone, the chief executive of CLSA, is planning to quit after three decades in charge of the Hong Kong brokerage controlled by China’s state-owned Citic Securities.

"Why female founders are tapping female investors for cash","Women entrepreneurs hope that a greater pool of investors will bring more diversity and less sexism","© Anna Gordon/FT When Esther Crawford was trying to get early stage investors interested in Squadapp, a screen-sharing chat app she founded aimed mainly at teenage girls, she attended a founder and investor event. One male investor she pitched to suggested they meet at a café. When she arrived she pulled out her laptop with her financial presentation on it. “He said: ‘Oh, you’re pitching me. I thought we were meeting up to get to know each other.”  The experience is familiar to many female entrepreneurs who are trying to attract funding. Early stage venture capital is still dominated by men. Women make up just 13 per cent of decision makers in venture capital in the UK, according to a 2017 report from Diversity VC. Female founded companies get less than 1 per cent of total UK venture capital, while male founded companies get 89 per cent, according to a February study by the British Business Bank. That is despite the fact that a third of entrepreneurs in the UK are female, according to the Rose Review published in March.  In the US, companies founded solely by women received just 2.3 per cent of the total capital invested in venture-backed start-ups, according to Pitchbook. Yet a Boston Consulting Group report last year found that companies founded or co-founded by women generated by 10 per cent more revenue on average over a five-year period than male-founded companies. Now things are changing. Female founders are taking matters into their own hands. They are increasingly seeking out female investors, while women experienced in the venture capital scene are setting up new networks and encouraging women to learn about angel investing: the private form of early stage investment before a founder turns to a professional venture capitalist.  Sarah Turner, who started Angel Academe, the angel network © Anna Gordon Emma Sinclair, who co-founded Enterprise Alumni, a corporate alumni management platform, recently completed a round of funding for her company that was backed 50 per cent by women. “Finding female investors was a labour of love,” she says.  The hope is that, as a greater pool of investors comes into the angel investing space, it will bring more diversity and less sexism.  Robyn Scott, co-founder of Apolitical, a platform that helps governments from different countries share ideas and is also 50 per cent female-backed, says that the issue is not men as such, but that “right now, there aren’t a lot of women investors or inclusive male investors. And given fundraising is often a numbers game, women founders are forced to go to the sexist jerks”. She adds: “Compounding the problem, there aren’t that many women raising, so an investor isn’t losing out on lots of great deals if he behaves like a jerk. But as the space becomes more competitive — with more women founders bringing great deals to more civilised investors — the deal flow to jerks will dry up,” she says. Scott adds that while she was fund raising when pregnant last year, at least one potential investor asked whether it was a planned pregnancy. The implication was that getting pregnant had somehow been irresponsible of her. “The idea an investor would think I can run a company but not plan a pregnancy was so infuriating and bizarre,” she says.  Sarah Turner founded angel network Angel Academe in London in 2014 to invest in tech companies with at least one woman on the founding team.  “Most of the women we’re investing in have stories about some sort of bias including real #metoo incidents where they think they’re meeting an investor and they think it’s a date over a drink,” she says. “None of those laws around gender discrimination can be applied as you’re dealing with people investing their money privately.”  Angel Academe now has 400 registered investors in the network, 80 per cent of whom are women, and runs workshops for new investors as well as pitch events.  Angel investors in the UK are required by the regulator to have a salary of at least £100,000 a year or £250,000 in investable assets as it is relatively high risk and capital may be locked away for seven-10 years — until the founder sells or lists the company. Turner said that when she started angel investing she was often the only female in the room and the experience was not particularly collaborative.  “I’ve been in rooms with men and you see their eyes glaze over when a woman comes to the stage. I thought I could do something that would work better for women. No one person knows everything — it was about having a group around me who I wanted to invest with and it’s grown from there,” says Turner.  Female founders and investors believe that unconscious bias also plays a role, particularly for those in the tech space. While there are hugely successful female founders with billion dollar companies, such as Katrina Lake, founder of Stitch Fix, or Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, often they are from the fashion industry, an area that is stereotypically associated with women. Turner points out that the most successful tech founders — Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google — were young men, so investors are perhaps unconsciously looking for people that fit that mould.  Katrina Lake, founder of Stitch Fix © Bloomberg Sara Blakely, who is behind the Spanx brand of women’s shapewear © Getty “There are such amazing women rock star entrepreneurs that are being undervalued,” says Suzanne Biegel, the founder of Catalyst at Large, which focuses on gender-smart investing and improving women’s access to capital. “It’s the unconscious bias of: you don’t look like the last 10 guys I invested in.” Biegel argues that failing to seek out female founded companies means early stage investors are limiting themselves. “Knowing that as an early stage investor some of your businesses will fail, you want to be diversified. It’s smart business. You’re cutting off your opportunity set.” She also recommends that people starting off as angel investors get involved with a group where they can pool their knowledge and skills. “It’s hard to be a successful angel: it’s an easy way to lose money. If you’re going down this path you want to be around other smart people to look at this with you.” Venture capitalists tend to ask male and female founders different types of questions, a study by academics at Harvard and Columbia Business schools found. Male founders were more likely to be asked about the potential for gains and women about the potential for losses. But if women reframed their answer to focus on gains, they were more likely to secure funding. Venture capitalists also used “radically different” language to describe male and female entrepreneurs, according to a Swedish study published in the Harvard Business Review in 2017. While a male entrepreneur would typically be described as “young and promising”, a female was described as “young, but inexperienced”. Lucy Lloyd, co-founder of Mentorloop, a software company that helps companies to organise mentoring programmes, recalls a male venture capitalist in the US asking how old she and her co-founder were and whether they had children. “He said they wouldn’t invest if they knew one of the founders was pregnant as it’s too much of a risk,” she recalls.  “At the time I was like, well that’s good to know: we either need to not get pregnant or hide that we’re pregnant if we’re looking for capital. But the more I reflect on it I realise it was ridiculous as VCs deal in risk and I’d say a pregnant co-founder is pretty much at the bottom of the risk pile: everyone knows what the outcome will be,” Lloyd adds. Lucy Lloyd, and with her co-founder Heidi Holmes, of software company Mentorloop  Others say there are far worse stories that they do not feel comfortable sharing publicly as they are still trying to seek funding. “There’s one guy, everyone knows who he is, who we call the boob-grabber,” says one founder. “Once we’ve exited and made our money, then we can talk more. But for now, it’s too risky.” Another adds: “You do feel this obligation sometimes that you should call everything out for the next people coming along but you’re in that pragmatic mindset of moving to the next step.” Lucy Lloyd © Anna Gordon Maren Bannon, cofounder of Jane VC, an early stage venture capital fund that invests in female-led start-ups, recalls that her male colleagues at Stanford Business School had a culture of networking that saw them invest in each others’ businesses, while the women were missing out. As a result, her fund has scrapped introductions that start-ups usually need to find funding. “It’s a very network driven industry and we feel that’s left the women and the diverse out,” she says. “We’ve said just pitch us directly: we want to hear from you.”  Start-ups with an introduction to a VC were 13 times more likely to get funding than those without, the British Business Bank study found. “We hear over and over that we’re the first female investor that they pitched. A lot of our excitement about starting this fund in 2018 was that it felt like there was a tipping point with people becoming more aware of it. We have a long way to go but we’re optimistic that the more female investors there are the more progress we can make,” Bannon says.  Marisa Drew, head of impact investment at Credit Suisse and an angel investor in her spare time focusing on female founders, says: “I’m a woman who has grown up in financial services and have always believed I’ve been very fortunate in my career and I have an obligation to give back to the next generation. If I put my money where my mouth is and invest in women then I can hopefully be a catalyst for creating some success stories.”  Jodie O’Keeffe, one of the investors in Angel Academe, says: “There’s a whole bunch of women out there with great ideas but can’t get them off the ground as the industry is male dominated. Eventually we’ll get to change the whole landscape.” O’Keeffe thinks that as a female investor she does more personal research on founders, such as calling customers and asking what it’s like to work with them. “At male dominated pitch events a lot of the discussions went straight to valuations, it was a lot about the numbers. We’ll think more about who the founder is.” Kate Glazebrook of Applied (left) and investor Jodie O’Keeffe © Anna Gordon Female founders say they are seeing a difference in the investor mix in recent years. Esther Crawford says the difference in just two years between her funding rounds in terms of women in the room has been “pretty stark”. Two years ago, she doesn’t recall a single women being in her pitch meetings. This time round, she estimates that women are present at a fifth of the meetings.  Jessi Baker, founder of Provenance, a blockchain company that enables ethically minded consumers to research business supply chains, says: “Pitching to a whole room of male investors, you can’t help feeling like an outsider or an anomaly. When you’re doing a start-up everyone is an anomaly as you’re trying to do something outside the status quo. Then not only am I crazy enough to quit my job and build a product that hasn’t been validated before, but standing in a room where I am the only woman as well. It’s a combination of the two. In past jobs if I presented to a room of men it didn’t matter.” Jessi Baker, founder of Provenance, a blockchain company © Anna Gordon  Alina Lapusneanu, founder of Fiskl, a software company offering mobile funding for small businesses, recalls one male investor asking who prepared her financial presentation for her. “It’s not necessarily mean but they’re a bit surprised as some of them are finance guys,” she says. She says she noticed female angel investors, particularly those looking to invest smaller amounts of £20,000, asking “way too detailed” questions, partly because the investment process was new for them.  “They don’t know to look at the meaningful things, they ask about forecasts three years in the future rather than looking at whether this distribution model works,” Lapusneanu says. This did not happen when she approached sophisticated female investors, she added. She theorised this could be due to a relative lack of experience rather than a gender difference. “Women generally don’t manage money closely and I think that makes the percentage of female investors smaller and less comfortable, unfortunately.” Alina Lapusneanu, founder of Fiskl, a software company offering mobile funding for small businesses © Anna Gordon  Seb Dovey, one of the male investors at Angel Academe, says female founders tend to do more work on the company before asking for money, he says. “Female founders appear more likely to come with the same business idea as a man but only after they’d had 10 invoices, where the male-dominated team would come without even the software to produce it.” Kate Glazebrook, cofounder of Applied, a recruitment platform that removes hiring bias, says: “I definitely think that the experience of pitching to lots of male investors at a particular stage in your career creates an environment where you don’t feel you belong. There’s a sense you stand out for being the female founder rather than because of your business.”  But she adds: “One thing I think often gets missed in these discussions of this stuff is it’s not always the case that men are particularly more biased against women than women are: the feature is the world is biased and we all absorb those biases unconsciously. The key to overcoming them is making sure we design our environments to remove the risk of bias affecting our decisions.” Jessi Baker says she did not see any difference between male and female investors when pitching. Rather, she felt that the female angels she pitched to did not want to be lenient with her and asked tough questions, “which I think is the correct attitude”. In fact, most of the female founders interviewed said that they were wary of drawing strict differences between male and female investors. The point, many believe, is to achieve a greater diversity of people supporting early stage companies. And female founders also point to a growing number of male investors who see the benefits of expanding their investment horizons. Adam Parr, former head of Williams F1 © Fisher Studios Adam Parr, former head of Williams F1 and now an active tech investor with a portfolio of start-ups, is a stakeholder in female-founded Apolitical. “I would feel so proud and love to be a founding investor in the first all-female board of a FTSE company as it is so rare,” he says. “We have a massive under-representation of women in this eco system of start-ups and spin outs.” Dovey says: “Whenever I explain what I’m doing to a large proportion of the male investment community they’re like, oh that’s interesting, why would you do that? Then they say: well how do I access this space?” Why women should invest in womenSubtitles unavailable","07.05.2019"
"The ousted chairman of Nissan makes clear he is ready for a long fight","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. After 50 days behind bars, a grim drawing of Carlos Ghosn in court, which was splashed all over Japanese television, showed a man looking gaunt with sunken cheeks, writes the FT’s Kana Inagaki from Tokyo for DD.   But when the ousted chairman of Nissan gave his 10-minute testimony this week, his message was still as sharp as when he was running one of the world’s largest automotive groups.  Ghosn made clear that he was going to fight Japanese prosecutors all the way through to clear himself of accusations of aggravated breach of trust and submitting accounts that understated his salary. (Read his full testimony here.) Unfortunately, under the controversial practices of Japan’s justice system where people suffer for asserting their innocence, that may mean Ghosn, who remains chief executive of France’s Renault, could be detained for another six months, according to his chief defence lawyer. A day after his emphatic speech, things have indeed changed very little for Ghosn. The Tokyo District Court quickly rejected a request from his lawyers seeking his release on bail. What’s next? On Friday, when his detention period over the latest allegations reaches an end, it’s looking increasingly likely that Ghosn will be indicted on charges of aggravated breach of trust. An even grimmer possibility is an arrest — his fourth since November 19 — over new accusations, which would once again reset the clock on his imprisonment.  As the Ghosn saga unfolds, Leo Lewis notes that the current crisis Nissan is in is an embarrassing reminder that Japan Inc has largely lost its influence to hobble an all-Japan rescue squad in times of need. “The much-cited symbiotic entwinement of state and big business has never been preened to look so hale,” he writes. London legal: another Kirkland poach rattles magic circle It was just over a year ago that US law firm Kirkland & Ellis stunned legal London with the hire of private equity supremo David Higgins from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer for a reported $10m a year. (Here’s our deep dive from last year into the universe of superstar lawyers). Well, on Wednesday we found out that Kirkland has come back for more, this time pinching another Freshfields private equity star lawyer, Adrian Maguire (pictured below).  Maguire is known to have strong relationships with buyout firms Cinven, Warburg Pincus, Carlyle and Advent, among others. “Adrian is the kind of partner that rolls up his sleeves, and clients love him,” said the head of a law firm that recently used a headhunter to try to hire him. The move underlines the threat to the so-called magic circle of law firms’ grip on their biggest earners after a stream of US hires last year. Clifford Chance and Allen & Overy both lost partners to Latham & Watkins, while Linklaters saw departures to Paul Hastings and Kirkland. Freshfields are being bullish about Maguire’s exit, saying “the strength and depth of our private equity practice is second to none”. Others are less sure. “This positions Kirkland & Ellis as the leading law firm for private equity deals in London,” the head of a rival outfit declared. And DD’s sources whisper that the US firm is unlikely to be satisfied with those two, something that will unsettle senior partners across the magic circle. Either way, it shows US firms are still brandishing those swollen cheque books in the intensifying tussle for the biggest private equity clients. Read our full story on Maguire’s hire here.  WeWork: dark before the dawn? On Tuesday evening WeWork executives gathered at Hollywood’s Universal Studios to hear their chief executive Adam Neumann explain the next phase of the group’s development: its rebranding as “The We Company”. While it has not yet legally reincorporated as The We Company, a shift at the $47bn group is well under way. The announcement, which was already long in the offing, came after SoftBank drastically downgraded a planned investment to $2bn from $16bn.  The scaling down of the Japanese conglomerate’s investment has pushed WeWork executives to consider something they had believed was much further off: plans for an initial public offering. SoftBank and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund have become some of the largest backers of private companies, helping to set and underpin record valuations, including for WeWork. Investors are now questioning what a hesitant SoftBank means for tech valuations writ large, especially as financial markets no longer move heedlessly higher. The market ructions come as a series of high-profile groups prepare for public life. There are 111 pending IPOs in the US, according to Bloomberg data, with most of the attention focused on the possibility of listings from Uber and its ride-hailing app rival Lyft, the messaging system Slack, the short-term rentals platform Airbnb, the social media site Pinterest and Palantir, a data analytics company. WeWork executives will at least have the benefit of seeing how the market responds to those flotations before it decides if it is ready to pull the trigger on an IPO.  Job moves Greg Palm, the co-general counsel of Goldman Sachs, is retiring, according to an internal memo first reported on by Bloomberg. He was due to leave last year but the departure was delayed.

"BB&T/SunTrust: a new dawn for bank M&A?","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. One scoop to start: SoftBank’s Vision Fund is set to invest $440m in British banking start-up OakNorth, according to two people close to the deal, in what will be the largest European fintech fundraising. Read Nicholas Megaw’s story here.  Let’s get this out of our system from the outset: Is TD Bank going to buy Goldman Sachs in a “merger of equals”? Or will Morgan Stanley swallow Capital One? Or how about PNC Financial combining with US Bancorp? We don’t really know. But the first mega-bank merger since the depth of the financial crisis has revived hopes (or fears in some instances) that America’s heavily fragmented banking industry is set to experience a new wave of consolidation. BB&T’s acquisition of rival SunTrust for $28bn is certainly a defining moment for the industry. It's fist bumps all round for SunTrust’s Bill Rogers, left, and BB&T’s Kelly King.   Under the Obama administration, the idea of allowing two large regional banks with combined assets worth more than $400bn to get together was seen as a very tough sell. Much has changed since. Some of the tougher rules and safeguards erected under Barack Obama to protect the US (and global) economy have now been loosened by Donald Trump. Rob Armstrong and Laura Noonan on the FT’s banking team explain that since Trump took occupancy of the White House, the Federal Reserve has said that rules for banks between $250bn and $750bn in assets, one tier below big national banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, should be “tailored”, including an easing of liquidity requirements.  The friendlier regulatory environment means we should expect more deals. But don’t hold your breath. Big bank M&A is tough. There are plenty of easy cost savings such as shutting down duplicate branches and laying off a ton of people, but the integration of complex financial institutions with distinct cultures is no small matter. Bill Harrison, former chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who was involved in eight bank mergers from 1987 to 2004, told the FT that “you need a strategic rationale to do something”. “They’re hard, it’s really really hard trying to bring all of these different cultures and people together to create a scenario where one plus one is greater than two,” said Harrison, who experienced first hand the first big merger by JPMorgan in 1991 when Chemical and Manufacturers combined. Despite the risks, Harrison said that the current environment will lead other players to reflect on what they should do: “When a deal like this is done it makes everybody who is a mid-sized bank sort of sit back and say well, what are we going to do?” Read more here. Wirecard: The latest in the FT investigatory series If you haven’t been following closely, let’s bring you up to speed. About a week ago, the FT’s Dan McCrum and Stefania Palma released a bombshell report about suspected forgery and backdating of contracts at the Asian head office of a German payments company called Wirecard.  At the time of their article, shares in Wirecard, which had a greater market value than that of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, fell sharply. And in response, the company said the story was “false, inaccurate, misleading and defamatory. This article lacks any substance and is completely meaningless.” One analyst at Commerzbank even called it “fake news” in a note that the bank has since withdrawn. Two days later, Dan and Stefania released a second story that Friday. This time, they reported that an external law firm commissioned by Wirecard to investigate its Singapore office had found evidence indicating “serious offences of forgery and/or of falsification of accounts”. The shares fell again. Later on Monday, Wirecard disclosed to investors that an external law firm has been investigating alleged accounting manipulations by “a member of Wirecard’s finance team” in Singapore since May 2018. In a call with analysts, Wirecard chief executive Markus Braun, pictured below, called the matter a “non-event” and said the investigation was ongoing. Now, Dan and Stefania have dropped their most detailed story yet.  In it, they report that certain documents show two senior executives in the Munich head office had at least some awareness of the round-tripping scheme. Round-tripping is the process of making money transfers in and out of a company look like actual revenue derived from legitimate business. Dan and Stefania report that an internal investigation, known as “Project Tiger”, was initially based on information provided by two whistleblowers. They also report that Jan Marsalek, Wirecard’s chief operating officer, had worked with the Singapore-based executive at the heart of the investigation on certain projects. This week the company told the FT that while its investigation was ongoing, it had made no conclusive findings of criminal misconduct and it would be wrong to draw conclusions from the preliminary report. It also provided further comment on its position, reported in the piece. Shares in the company have shed nearly a quarter so far.  One way to reduce antitrust enforcement . . .  There’s a lot of talk in Washington these days about competition, and whether antitrust enforcers should do more to police corporate giants, particularly those from Silicon Valley. The erosion of the US government’s enforcement capabilities under Donald Trump has received less attention.  Over the past two years, the Department of Justice’s antitrust division has lost some 13 per cent of its staff, according to phone directories we reviewed. In some places, the attrition has been more severe: the units in Washington that prosecute price-rigging conspiracies are down 27 per cent. Those figures include paralegals and support staff, as well as trial attorneys. While phone directories can have mistakes, the decline we found aligned with the impressions of former attorneys in the division and antitrust lawyers who regularly deal with the justice department. That makes this article on the DoJ from Kadhim Shubber interesting food for thought as you contrast his story with the recent coverage of competition enforcement from Brussels.  Behind the Money: Patisserie Valerie This week, Behind the Money digs into the fall of coffee and cake chain Patisserie Valerie.

"Has the yield curve predicted the next US downturn?","Some believe that an inversion of the markets’ original ‘fear gauge’ is not a predictor but a cause of recessions"," Alan Greenspan, the then Federal Reserve chairman nicknamed The Oracle for his economic soothsaying, told the US Senate on July 21 2005 to disregard an obscure glitch in markets that some fretted could portend an economic slowdown. The so-called “yield curve” was obsolete, he declared. “The evidence very clearly indicates that its efficacy as a forecasting tool has diminished very dramatically because of economic events,” Mr Greenspan confidently told the Senate Banking Committee. The yield curve is Wall Street’s original “fear gauge”, notching up a perfect predictive record before pretenders such as the Vix index were even glimmers in the eyes of financial engineers. Typically, countries pay less to borrow for three months than five years, and less for five years than for a decade — after all, investors want some compensation for the gradual erosion of inflation, or the risk, albeit faint, that a government could renege on its debt. Plotted on a graph, the bond yields of various maturities form a “yield curve” that most of the time slopes gently upwards. But sometimes short-term yields rise above longer-term ones, an “inversion” of the usual shape of the curve that has been an uncannily accurate 
harbinger of recessions, preceding every downturn since the end of the second world war. For instance, when Mr Greenspan in 2005 read the last rites for the yield curve’s predictive powers, the three-month Treasury bill yield was still 0.9 percentage points below the 10-year Treasury yield. A year later the curve inverted and 18 months after that the US economy entered its worst recession since the 1930s. Ominously, the US yield curve has now inverted once again, with the 10-year Treasury yield on March 22 dipping below the three-month T-bill yield for the first time since 2007. Combined with the length of the post-crisis expansion — this summer it will become the longest growth spurt in US history — and deteriorating economic data, the inverted yield curve has stirred fears that the countdown to the next downturn has already begun.  “The curve has been flattening and sending a warning signal for some time,” says Douglas Peebles, head of fixed income at AllianceBernstein. “I’m a yield curve junkie and I don’t think you can ignore that.” But it is a complicated soothsayer. Signs of steadier growth have now lifted the yield curve back into positive territory, and investors and economists remain relatively sanguine, arguing that there are market forces at play that are distorting the curve’s message.  “I’m not worried,” says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. “The yield curve’s signal is not what it used to be.” Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan declared the yield curve’s forecasting efficacy obsolete two years before the US entered recession  Paul Samuelson, the Nobel economics laureate, once joked that the notoriously fickle stock market had forecast nine of the past five recessions.  This was at the back of Campbell Harvey’s mind when he was considering doctoral dissertations at the University of Chicago in 1983. A summer internship at a Toronto mining company had hammered home how useful it would be for companies to have a better market indicator to gauge the economic outlook, but reams of research had also amply demonstrated the stock market’s patchy record of prediction. Inspired by an obscure 1965 paper noting how the yield curve undulated with the economic cycle, Prof Harvey realised this could be a much cleaner way of gauging recession risks. His thesis committee was initially sceptical, given the paucity of observations, but it has become part of the canonical work on the yield curve.  Its simplicity is a major reason for the scepticism, according to Prof Harvey, now a professor of finance at Duke University. “The model is really simple. It’s a point of attack” for critics, he says. “But it’s got a good record.” Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell has now shelved plans to raise rates © Bloomberg In essence, the yield curve distils the wisdom of millions of investors, and their views of the current and future health of the economy. Individual fund managers may be wrong from time to time, but the overall judgment of a lot of smart people tends to be fairly accurate. Longer-term bond yields are influenced by interest rates set by central banks, but mostly by the economic outlook. When investors think economic clouds are gathering, which will depress inflation, they tend to buy Treasuries, lowering their yields. And when they sink below short-term bond yields — which are more closely aligned to base interest rates — it is a strong indication that investors think monetary policy is too tight for the deteriorating health of the economy. That can precipitate a recession and force the central bank to cut rates again, buoying bond prices. However, there are many forces that shape yields. And some could be causing the bond market’s soothsaying glitch to suffer a glitch itself, say economists and investors. “You are an idiot to ignore the yield curve but it is not proof that a recession is coming by itself,” says Seth Carpenter, chief US economist at UBS and a former senior Treasury and Federal Reserve official.  Post-crisis regulation encouraged banks to keep more money in ultra-safe assets, and it is hard to find anything safer than US Treasuries. The Fed is still sitting on $2tn of Treasuries acquired through bond-buying programmes, while negative interest rates and quantitative easing programmes in Europe and Japan have nurtured colossal demand for highly rated debt. Combined with secular forces such as technology and demographics subduing inflation, that keeps longer-term yields pinned down — almost irrespective of the economic situation. At the same time the US government is 
financing much of its yawning budget deficit by issuing short-term bills rather than longer-term bonds. Combined with the Fed’s recent balance sheet shrinkage and interest rate increases, that has exerted tremendous upward pressure on Treasury bill yields.  Nobel laureate for economics Paul Samuelson once joked that the stock market had forecast nine of the past five recessions  This is why many fund managers prefer to use the two- and 10-year Treasury yields as a cleaner measure of the curve’s shape. This “spread” has remained positive, bouncing around between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent since last year. The two and 30-year Treasury spread, another popular measure, has actually steepened this year, muddying the yield curve’s signal. Moreover, its predictive abilities seem to travel poorly. Japan, the UK and Germany have all seen inversions in the past without suffering recession. Some investors therefore argue that the yield curve preoccupation is overwrought. “The market has become overly obsessed with it,” says Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at Amundi, the asset management company. However, this does not negate the signal the yield curve is sending, according to Peter Fisher, a former top New York Fed and Treasury official, head of fixed income at BlackRock and now a professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. “The mistake is to think it is a predictor of recessions,” he says. “I think it causes recessions.” He argues that a flat or inverted yield curve dampens the willingness of banks to lend. After all, their funding costs are tied to short-term interest rates. But when longer-term rates fall below their cost of financing, the incentive to lend is ruined. That then ripples through the economy and helps cause a recession, rather than merely predicting one.   Recent research by the St Louis Fed indicates that Prof Fisher’s causation argument may ring true, but it remains a minority view. Indeed, setting aside the bond market’s bout of nerves last month, most investors still seem fairly relaxed.  The US stock market took a beating on the day of the inversion, but has still enjoyed its best start to a year since 1998, and junk bonds — which should be particularly sensitive to any sign of weaker growth — have notched up their best quarter of returns in a decade. “The recent inversion of the US yield curve is a classic late-cycle, but not yet end-cycle, market indicator,” says Robert Buckland, chief global equity strategist at Citi. “History suggests it’s a reason to be wary, but not outright bearish.” Prof Harvey’s research indicates only an inversion of at least three months is a reliable recession indicator. The curve briefly inverted in 1998, at the peak of the turmoil caused by Russia’s default and the blow-up of Long-Term Capital Management, but quickly normalised before a subsequent, more durable inversion in 2000 preceded the dotcom bust. The latest inversion only lasted five trading days.  Moreover, it can take a long time between an upside-down curve and an actual recession, and it appears that the delay is becoming longer. The shortest time was just one quarter, in 1957. The average lag is about five quarters, but the longest period between a negative yield curve and a recession was almost two years, and that was before the 2008 financial crisis.  This time it could take even longer. The Fed has now shelved plans to raise rates, and most analysts say growth is only slowing, not collapsing. The central bank’s own economists predict the pace of expansion will only decelerate slightly, to 2.1 per cent this year, 1.9 per cent in 2020 and 1.8 per cent in 2021. Even self-confessed “yield curve junkies” such as Mr Peebles stress that any inversion should not trigger panic. “I’m not ignoring the yield curve, but for the time being I don’t think we have to be overly concerned,” he says. Fed vice-chair Randal Quarles has attributed the inverted yield curve to the central bank’s balance sheet shrinkage © Bloomberg Wary of the bond market jitters, the Fed’s top officials insist that the US economy remains in good shape, and argue that it is the yield curve that is malfunctioning. “There are a lot of reasons to think that it has been a recession predictor for reasons in the past that don’t apply today,” John Williams, president of the New York Fed, said last week. Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice-chair, attributed the twisted curve to the central bank’s balance sheet shrinkage. “I don’t view it as much of a harbinger,” he added last week.
 However, there have always been various plausible reasons offered for why the yield curve is obsolete, and yet its record is spookily good — in fact, much better than the Fed’s. Prof Fisher points out that the only recession that the central bank has ever successfully forecast was the one it deliberately caused in the early 1980s, when then-chairman Paul Volcker ratcheted up interest rates to record levels to kill off inflation.  The New York Fed’s yield-derived model for calculating the probability of a recession over the next 12 months indicates that the odds on an economic downturn have shot up to 29 per cent, the highest since the beginning of 2007 — a higher probability than was seen a year ahead of five of the past seven recessions, according to Credit Suisse.  Prof Fisher fears the Fed and markets are complacent about the dangers. Paraphrasing the apocryphal saying about history often attributed to Mark Twain, he adds: “The yield curve doesn’t repeat itself exactly, but it has a rhythm.”  Additional reporting by Katie Martin

 Chart doctor: the mysterious music of the yield curveSubtitles unavailable  ‘This time is different’ — why inversion has sometimes been ignored “This time is different” are the four most dangerous words in finance. Here are the previous explanations given for why the yield curve’s inversion could safely be ignored.1989 argument: The yield curve is artificially inverted because commercial banks are buying longer-term Treasuries instead of lending to real estate. Result: the US economy suffered a brief recession from July 1990 to March 1991, because of rising interest rates and an oil price shock caused by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent first Gulf war.2000 argument: The yield curve is artificially inverted because the Clinton administration is running a budget surplus and no longer issuing long-maturity Treasuries. Result: the collapse of the dotcom bubble and the September 11 terrorist attacks caused a mild recession from March 2001 to November 2001.2006 argument: The yield curve is artificially inverted because a global savings glut is keeping longer-term bond yields pinned down. Result: the deflating housing bubble and subprime mortgage meltdown caused a global financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.2019 argument: The yield curve is artificially inverted because of the Fed’s market-distorting quantitative easing programme, a jump in Treasury bill issuance and low global interest rates.

"Car industry swerves to avoid hazards ahead","Fears of ‘car-mageddon’ look premature as groups brace for downturn with job cuts","On the surface, the global car industry seems to be surrounded by crises. Job cuts this week from Jaguar Land Rover and Ford followed redundancies and plant closures announced by General Motors late last year. These, and the challenges faced by the sector, have raised fears of “car-mageddon”. Chinese sales have slowed, sapping earnings in the world’s most profitable market. The trade war between the US and China risks playing havoc with the global manufacturing strategies of big companies. Tougher rules around CO2 emissions are forcing carmakers to spend heavily on electric technology just as diesel vehicles, the industry’s favourite way of lowering carbon pollution, have fallen out of favour. Even Britain’s impending departure from the EU, although small globally, is causing a great deal of concern for any groups with exposure to the market. Add to this plateauing sales in the US and Europe, a warning that the boom times in this cyclical world may be fading, and the mood across the industry is bleak.  “These serious challenges are not coming in singles or pairs but in hordes,” said JLR chief executive Ralf Speth. “As a young niche player we feel these impacts sooner and to a greater degree.” But despite the gathering clouds, many of the sector’s key indicators are far from gloomy. On Friday Volkswagen Group reported record car sales for last year, despite being unable to sell many of its cars in Europe for several weeks following the introduction of a new European emissions testing regime in September. The group, the world’s largest carmaker, expected global car demand to grow slightly in 2019, but forecasts stagnation for China, its largest and most profitable market. In the US and Europe, sales remain robust, while the trend among consumers to ditch smaller saloon cars for high-riding sports utility vehicles bodes well for the industry’s profitability. In fact, for an industry that normally only resorts to job cuts and closures in times of crisis, shedding roles at the top of the cycle when sales are strong is highly unusual.  “Something new is going on here,” said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein. “Companies normally only restructure in the depths of crisis when there’s no alternative.” He suggested it indicated a greater focus on short-term profits at the businesses, which is no bad thing in an industry that has seen shares decline over the past year as investors write off the sector’s chances of taking on cash-rich technology rivals in areas such as ride-sharing.  The cuts made by JLR, Ford and GM can also be explained by internal problems at each business. JLR, Britain’s largest manufacturer, launched a £2.5bn savings plan last year to stem losses amid an onslaught of problems, including falling diesel sales and Chinese problems exacerbated by years of overspending at the company when it was on the ascent. Ford on Thursday announced sweeping cuts across Europe, with “thousands” of roles going in its own attempts to bring the region back into the black by cutting unprofitable models. Globally, it is looking to save $14bn from operations in China, Latin America and Europe. When General Motors in November pledged to close seven sites, including four US facilities, it aimed the axe at facilities that principally produced saloon cars that are increasingly out of favour with car buyers.  Both Ford and Fiat Chrysler have already moved out of passenger cars in the US to focus on SUVs and pick-up trucks — GM was a laggard in this respect. Yet GM’s profits have improved because of the actions. On Friday it upgraded expectations for 2018, and said 2019 profits would climb further still because of the cost savings. Earnings “will benefit from the restructuring to the tune of $2bn-$2.5bn in 2019,” said GM chief financial officer Dhivya Suryadevara. Mr Warburton at Bernstein suggested the three series of cuts were “aggressive housekeeping” by businesses that failed to change sooner. The slew of cuts comes as the industry prepares to gather in Detroit for the city’s annual motor show, which historically is a chance to present the designs and models that will dominate the automotive calendar in the coming year. This year’s affair will be subdued, and not only because a number of manufacturers are not attending after deciding to spend their events budgets elsewhere, not least at the technology-heavy Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Despite an array of new products, the focus is expected to be on the outlook for the sector and how US carmakers will respond to the trade war and falling Chinese sales. The industry still faces a wide range of dangers that will make the coming downturn difficult. Car sales have risen strongly in key markets, notably the US and Europe, for several years since the financial crash.  In the US, the past two years have seen the market buoyed by natural disasters that led to the need for many thousands of cars to be replaced. Europe’s sales remain strong, but huge uncertainty stems from Brexit, and a disorderly exit this year would send shockwaves around the continent that could knock consumer and business confidence.  China’s market, whose two-decade growth run has boosted the industry’s profit levels, has turned, with only government intervention likely to stem a fall. Data on Monday is expected to show the first annual reverse in China’s car sales since the 1990s.  Even if all three markets hang on to their near-peak levels for another year or so, the industry is soon likely to experience falling sales as the rising cycle can only go on for so long. At the same time as fighting off falling sales, carmakers will need to invest in new and expensive electric technology to meet CO2 emissions rules in Europe and sales mandates in China. GM cuts jobs in face of bleak outlook Subtitles unavailable  When they do sell electric cars in greater numbers, they will make less money on them because of costly battery technology that consumers appear unwilling to pay for. US-based manufacturers are also facing increased challenges. Ford and GM are both facing $1bn of extra costs on their metals after tariffs on imported steel and aluminium led to domestic providers raising their prices. New rules replacing the Nafta agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada require greater use of parts made in North America, as well as a higher proportion of workers to be paid $16 an hour or above. And companies that set up their US operations as export bases, such as BMW in Spartanburg or Volvo in Charleston, are facing the prospect of having to re-purpose their facilities to serve the local market instead to counter Donald Trump’s proposed tax levies on imported vehicles. Structurally, the industry is also entering a drawn-out period where cars without hybrid or electric features will dwindle, leading to a shift from internal combustion technology to battery power, and the need for a refreshed workforce with a different skillset. Add in the possible job losses from robotics and automation, and companies may be forced to make deeper cuts in the coming years. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimate the industry needs about 18 per cent fewer workers than currently employed.  For most analysts, therefore, the coming downturn is not a question of “if” but “when”. “There is a perfect storm coming,” said Philippe Houchois at Jefferies. “Fortunately, it is coming slowly enough that management teams are responding sooner.” GM takes on Tesla to light up electric race General Motors has vowed to take on Tesla by re-casting its luxury Cadillac brand as an electric nameplate. GM already produces the Chevrolet Bolt, the first long-distance affordable family car to run only on batteries. On Friday GM said the premium marque would be the company’s “lead electric vehicle brand and will introduce the first model from the company’s all-new battery electric vehicle architecture”. The company said its electric components were being designed to work across an array of models, allowing the same technology to be used in large vehicles and smaller cars. A similar system is being developed by Volkswagen, which wants its electric architecture to become the standard underlying technology used by the industry. Tesla has long dominated sales of premium electric vehicles, but the US brand faces fresh challenges, not only from the upcoming electric Cadillac, but also from European premium nameplates. Jaguar’s I-Pace was the first all-electric SUV from a European brand, while the Audi E-tron, the Mercedes EQC and the BMW iX3 will all play in the same part of the market. Dozens of new models are expected to come to market in the next two years — providing consumers with real choice for the first time, and companies such as Tesla with real competition. Peter Campbell

  Adam Neumann has split investor opinion since WeWork, his office leasing company, had only one building, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson writes in a profile. “People were sceptical . . . but once you get in a room with him [and] listen to his vision, you get attracted,” one banker said. Even Mr Neumann’s future wife, Rebekah, told him he was “full of shit” on their first date, before changing her mind and marrying him.  Now the company — which rebranded this week to The We Company — is worth up to $42bn, and Mr Neumann is talking about diversifying into schools and apartment buildings as part of a larger mission “to elevate the world’s consciousness”. Though some critics believe the company has an unworkable cost structure and complain that it lacks enough proprietary technology to support its valuation, former Goldman Sach chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, a WeWork investor, tells Andrew that he is sold. “He’s getting huge financing from people who don’t give ice in the winter.” Gideon Rachman explores the surprising revival of enthusiasm for Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt. Liberalism’s most brilliant enemy is back in vogue, because his theories appeal to opponents of democracy and the rule of law. Sarah Gordon urges the UK to solve the aristocracy’s Downton Abbey problem. Five daughters of hereditary peers are demanding the right to be elected to the House of Lords. Tim Harford writes about the art of political brinkmanship. Donald Trump, Theresa May and other elected politicians are threatening harm to their own countries as a bargaining tactic, he points out. Izabella Kaminska contends that the recent drone sightings that shut down London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports show that we need an air traffic control system for drones. The UK is well placed to forge a national, if not global standard. Viv Groskup takes the occasion of the opening of the new film about Laurel and Hardy, Stan and Ollie, to write about the curious dynamic of comedy duos and their widespread appeal. Camilla Cavendish argues that an integrated vision for the UK National Health Service is long overdue. The complexity of the system creates perverse incentives and does patients a disservice.

Please, President Trump, appoint Senator Warren to be your secretary of state.
 In response to The ‘China shock’ has not been as bad as Donald Trump thinks, observer says:  Alas as with almost all aspects of progress up the value curve, the losses are concentrated and the gains are distributed widely. The US consumer benefits greatly from cheaper goods, it has allowed lower wage workers to afford much more than they would have in the absence of trade. Politically, however, the minority badly affected have a disproportionate impact on electoral results as the winners from trade take the gains for granted.
 Ackoff’s dictum offers apt lesson for the Commons, letter from Martin Westlake, Brussels, Belgium With the House of Commons seeking to oblige the prime minister to present an alternative plan (January 9), I am reminded of an observations by the late systems theorist, Russell Ackoff: “The righter we do the wrong thing, the wronger we become. When we make a mistake doing the wrong thing and correct it, we become wronger. When we make a mistake doing the right thing and correct it, we become righter. Therefore, it is better to do the right thing wrong than the wrong thing right.” Which, I wonder, do the various actors think they are doing?

"Klasse fantastisch: PE feeling super-duper at SuperReturn","Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing","FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email. Hello there, I’m DD’s Javier Espinoza. I’ve spent the past week mixing it up with the bigwigs of the private equity business and their investors at the annual SuperReturn conference, the one must-attend gathering of the PE calendar.From Apollo’s Leon Black to Carlyle’s David Rubenstein, general partners gather with their investors at the InterContinental Hotel in Berlin to show off their smarts and talk about the industry.    
  Some of the hotel bedrooms have been converted into offices. Attendees duck out of sessions and hold one-on-one speed dating-like meetings in private. In the evenings, it’s all about wining and dining your investors.   It’s a common refrain here that the mood at the conference is a good indicator of just how frothy things are in the market. This is my third year here and it’s definitely louder and more bullish than previous years. Buyout bosses can’t believe their luck. They’ve raised their largest funds and struck their biggest deals in what’s the strongest market for the buyout sector in history. The going is even better by some measure than the heydays leading up to the financial crisis. “You can hear it out there. It’s buzzy, everyone is raising money, everyone is very positive,” Mounir Guen, industry veteran head of MVision, which helps firms raise funds, told DD. Dealmakers have many reasons to be chirpy. After a wobble late last year, the debt market remains open, with cheap and plentiful financing available. Investors are aggressively competing to get into the top-tier funds for fear of missing out on the chance to earn some good returns. A report by Bain & Company published at the start of the conference showed how deal counts and the volume of public to private transactions are ticking higher. 
  
  The same report also showed this has been a period when investors have received record amounts of cash back from the funds where they park their money. “The mood is pretty upbeat. Everyone has been doing pretty well,” said the European head of a multibillion buyout fund on the sidelines of the conference.Here’s a nice breakdown of the firepower waiting to be deployed.  
  
  This wall of cash that’s flooding the industry is also leading to signs of reckless behaviour. At cocktail parties, executives talk of auction processes done at dizzying speeds to outbid rivals.“I had only the weekend to sign on a multibillion deal recently,” said the head of a mid-market German buyout fund.“Some people are just hoping to find someone dumb enough to buy their company before a downturn hits,” said another German executive.Still, there are those who worry the tide will turn. “I don’t want enormous catastrophes to happen and none of us do,” Kewsong Lee, co-chief executive of US buyout fund Carlyle, told an audience on Thursday. “We are already factoring in that there may be a recession two or three years out.”A recession is not the only worry. Brexit was on dealmakers’ minds too. “[The UK] will be an excellent place to invest in the fullness of time. In the next while, it’s unsure,” said Bruce Flatt, chief executive of Brookfield, the Canadian owner of Canary Wharf and one of the largest investors in the UK.“There is consternation,” he added.Others shared his fears. Carlyle’s Rubenstein called for the UK to have a second referendum to resolve the stalemate on Brexit.“I do think that the only solution that I can see that would make sense to resolve this problem is a re-vote. The first vote was — you could say — not relatively informed because it wasn’t clear what Brexit really meant. Now it is clear,” he told a packed room of mostly men in suits on Wednesday.Others aren’t letting doom and gloom over a possible recession or Brexit spoil the party.A female executive at a large multibillion US fund summed up the mood nicely.She told DD: “Everyone is worried when they are going to shut the bar down, but until they do, they are going to have another drink.” An economy for everyone: Leo Strine fires off on short-termism Few judges are as important to corporate America as Leo Strine, the supreme court chief justice in Delaware, the state in which two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated. So he found a rapt audience on Tuesday when he addressed a New York investor forum organised by CECP (which has just redefined its 20-year-old acronym to fit the purpose-driven times, from the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy to Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose).In a conversation with Tensie Whelan, director of New York University’s Stern Center for Sustainable Business, the judge fired off various proposals for fixing investor short-termism and encouraging more sustainable corporate behaviour. These ranged from introducing a fractional trading tax to make it harder for investors to fund-hop to investors stepping up to stop companies’ political spending.   
  “We can’t talk about sustainability while we have folks who’ve suppressed climate change research, folks who suppress the ability to put in place any rational pricing of carbon, and when they’re doing it using money from ordinary people’s portfolios without their permission,” he said, positing that conservatives would be equally opposed to “a whole lot of Silicon Valley CEOs with their own version of ‘woke’ spending”.In another riff, he proposed limitations on shareholder proposals to annual meetings, suggesting that an investor should have to show that owners of perhaps $25m worth of stock in the company support their proposal before it goes forward to reduce “noise” and focus investors’ thinking on the long term.Perhaps most striking were his warm words for Bernie Sanders, the Democratic senator from Vermont known for railing against the power of corporate “millionaires and billionaires”.Companies “short-cutting the people who sweat” had contributed to profound economic anxiety akin to that seen in the late 1920s and 1930s, Judge Strine said. The response to that was FDR’s New Deal democracy, he noted, “which became a role model for market dynamism tempered with fairness for everybody”. If the US doesn’t find that balance again, he warned, the demands for more substantial change would grow.“When people taunt Bernie Sanders as if he’s a communist they show a profound ignorance of market economies and history,” the judge said. He did not agree with Sanders on everything, he cautioned, “but he’s pretty centrist when you look at Europe”. Asking rhetorically whether Scandinavia or Germany were “crappy-assed communist nations”, he lectured his listeners: “When we lampoon European social democracy we’re lampooning what we did to make a market economy work for all.”Strine fans can find the full webcast here.  Bristol-Myers is having to swallow some bitter medicine One of the biggest healthcare deals in history is now officially under attack. As DD readers already knew, activist Starboard Value had built a small stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb. What exactly Starboard was angling for at the healthcare group had remained unknown (although analysts and investors had speculated the fund wanted to torpedo its $90bn takeover of Celgene). On Thursday, the world found out that Jeffrey Smith, chief executive of Starboard, wanted far more than just to block the deal. Smith, pictured below, is agitating for Bristol to explore all of its options, including a possible sale.  That’d be a monstrous undertaking and itself could rank among the largest healthcare deals ever struck. Bristol has a market cap of about $85bn. Granted Smith and Starboard would likely take a smaller deal; after all they could simply push for asset sales or a spin-off of one or the company’s units. It’s clear the pressure is on Bristol and its advisers (including Morgan Stanley, Evercore and Dyal Co) to see this transaction through. They’ve already had to defend the deal after Bristol’s largest shareholder Wellington Management came out against the deal. The question on every healthcare banker’s lips is whether Starboard will be successful. Hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the investment bankers and lawyers are on the line. And let’s not forget the effect this deal will have on tens of thousands of employees and the patients who use Bristol and Celgene medications. Oh, and there’s that hefty termination fee . . .  Job moves HBO chief executive Richard Plepler is resigning from the network behind hits like Game of Thrones, True Detective and Westworld, as part of a restructuring under new owner AT&T.

"BlackRock’s Fink looks to a ‘deep bench’ to pick heir","Despite Mark Wiedman’s promotion, observers say other executives remain in the running","Last week, Larry Fink promoted Mark Wiedman, the head of BlackRock’s sprawling index investing business, to a new enlarged role that thrusts him to the top of the list of executives likely to take up the reins of the $6.4tn asset management group if its founder decides to step down.  However, Mr Fink likes to brag about BlackRock’s “deep bench” of senior executives, and in his memo announcing Mr Wiedman’s promotion he hinted at a broader reshuffle later this year. Insiders say that no one senior is expected to leave, but new frontrunners could still emerge as roles are rejigged.  While there are no hints of the BlackRock founder planning to step down, about a half-dozen people are broadly considered by internal and external observers to be in the running to succeed Mr Fink when he does retire: three Marks, two Robs, and one Rich.   Mark Wiedman
 Until this week, Mr Wiedman was head of BlackRock’s $4.1tn index investing group, which includes asset manager’s crown jewel — iShares, the rapidly growing exchange-traded fund business acquired from Barclays in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr Wiedman is a gregarious Long Island native, who joined BlackRock in 2004 after stints at McKinsey and as an adviser to the US Treasury. His first job was at an advisory group that counselled BlackRock clients such as central banks on market issues, but rose to head corporate strategy and in 2011 was put in charge of the iShares business and tasked with integrating it fully into BlackRock. When he took over iShares, it had about $600bn in assets. Today, it manages $1.8tn, and accounted for almost a third of BlackRock’s revenue in the third quarter. Mr Wiedman is now overseeing all international operations, corporate strategy and marketing.  “The future is all about creating new markets,” Mr Wiedman said in a 2012 interview with the FT. “The idea that giant insurance companies that are accustomed to buying individual bonds or derivatives are now beginning to use ETFs as core parts of their portfolios, that is totally new and we are starting to see it globally.”  Age: 48
 Born: Long Island, New York
 Marital Status: Married, two boys
 Education: Harvard, Yale Law School
 Hobbies: reading history, science fiction and spy novels; running (slowly); learning to sail
  Mark McCombe
 Mr McCombe, the San Francisco-based head of Americas at BlackRock, is a more recent arrival at the asset manager, having been poached from HSBC in 2011. At HSBC, he ran the British bank’s asset management arm and ultimately its Hong Kong operations before jumping ship for BlackRock, and was considered a frontrunner to replace Stephen Hester as chief executive of RBS in 2013.  About 40 per cent of BlackRock’s client assets are managed out of San Francisco, where Barclays Global Investors was based before Mr Fink swooped for the group in 2009. The location also allows Mr McCombe to be BlackRock’s main liaison when it comes to California’s big pension funds as well as the growing Asian customer base, a major priority for the investment group in the coming years.  His ties to Asia and Hong Kong especially are extensive, and in 2006 he was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s New Year honours List. As a point person for BlackRock’s US pension business, he has focused on retirement as a live wire subject for the coming years.  “We want to take a lead in addressing what we believe is one of the most significant and important societal issues we face today and every individual faces today,” he said at BlackRock’s investor day last year. Age: 52
 Born: UK
 Marital Status: Married, one girl, two boys
 Education: Aberdeen University, Wharton Business School
 Hobbies: Cycling, skiing, family and travel
  Mark Wiseman
 Another relatively new arrival at BlackRock, Mr Wiseman was chief executive at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board — one of the biggest and most sophisticated pension schemes in the world — before Mr Fink brought him to BlackRock in 2016 (where his wife Marcia Moffat already worked). The hockey-loving Canadian chairs BlackRock Alternative Investors, where he is working on building up its private equity and debt investing business, a big priority in the coming years. But his main job is to run the asset manager’s $366bn global active equities business. This unit is a profitable but long under-performing corner of the investment group. Mr Wiseman is an advocate of integrating more advanced analytics, systematic investing techniques, big data and technology broadly into the traditional stockpicking process. He is trying to use BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities, its San Francisco-based quant arm, to modernise the rest of its stockpicking operations.  “If you’re a traditional portfolio manager it’s a challenging time because there’s so much change happening around you,” Mr Wiseman told the FT last year. “If you’re unwilling to evolve you’re likely going to get eaten alive.” Age: 48
 Born: Niagara Falls, Canada
 Marital Status: Married, two boys
 Education: Queen’s University, University of Toronto, Yale University
 Hobbies: Ice hockey, skiing, running
  Rob Goldstein
 Mr Goldstein is the youngest member of BlackRock’s global executive committee, but the only one to have spent his entire professional career at the asset manager.  Mr Goldstein joined BlackRock in 1994 as a 20-year-old analyst in its portfolio analytics group, and has been instrumental in building up Aladdin, the famed analytics and risk management platform that underpins all of the group’s operations and has been sold to other asset managers around the world.  Short for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network, Aladdin is now used by 25,000 other investment managers that manage more than $18tn. Aladdin is the centrepiece of BlackRock’s technology services sales, which were a bright spot in the third quarter.  Mr Goldstein is now chief operating officer, in charge of the BlackRock Solutions unit that houses Aladdin, and oversees all technology at the investment group. Last year, he championed a new “BlackRock Lab for Artificial Intelligence” in Palo Alto, California, on the view that machine learning can enhance its operations across the board. “AI may be in a big hype cycle but there’s no doubt the technology is real and changing the world already,” Mr Goldstein said in an interview with the FT at the time. “This is about increasing the efficiency of what we do across the board. Every part of our business is already being augmented by these new capabilities.” Age: 45
 Born: Brooklyn, New York
 Marital status: Married, one boy, one girl
 Education: Binghamton University
 Hobbies: New York Rangers and Brooklyn Nets, fishing, travelling with his family, birdwatching, the Grateful Dead
  Rob Kapito
 Mr Kapito is one of the co-founders of BlackRock, its president since 2007 and Larry Fink’s right-hand man. The second-highest paid person at the asset manager is in charge of all day-to-day operations of its major units. Before becoming president he was in charge of all of BlackRock’s portfolio management across equities, bonds and alternative investments.  As a co-founder and top executive who has worked with Mr Fink at First Boston (later Credit Suisse First Boston) as a mortgage trader in the 1980s, Mr Kapito was long considered the favourite to take over as BlackRock’s chief executive if the top man had snagged the Treasury Secretary job he has long wanted.  However, as Mr Fink’s departure has been put off, observers expect that Mr Kapito’s age — he is just five years younger than BlackRock’s chief executive and turns 62 on February 8 — means that he could now lose out to one of the younger guns on the asset manager’s senior management group. The former mortgage trader has warned that many financial services companies were too complacent about the threat of disruptive technology and new entrants. “Apple was not in the music industry, Google was not in the mobile phone industry and Amazon was not in the groceries business — until they were,” Mr Kapito said at Davos last year. “Tech companies are going to enter the financial services market in a very, very aggressive way.”  Age: 61
 Born: Monticello, New York
 Marital status: Married, four children, three grandchildren
 Education: Wharton, Harvard Business School
 Hobbies: Golfing, skiing, driving restored vintage cars
  Rich Kushel
 Mr Kushel is not as well-known as some of the other members of “Larry’s bench”. But insiders say the BlackRock veteran — he joined the investment group in 1991 from Prudential Securities and has held a wide variety of jobs since then — is well-regarded internally and among the top half-dozen or so candidates to succeed Mr Fink. After a series of senior positions, Mr Kushel took charge of BlackRock’s global fixed income investing in February 2018, in addition to his job leading multi-asset strategies. BlackRock’s bond group manages almost a third of its overall assets, and accounted for about $2bn of revenues in 2017, or roughly one-sixth of all that year’s income.  At BlackRock’s investor day in 2018, Mr Kushel argued that the typical investor approach to portfolio construction had not evolved much since the theories first put forward by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz in the 1950s — and was thus a big opportunity for a big, broad financial supermarket like BlackRock. “We believe that BlackRock could and should do better and set the objective to raise the bar, update current practice and apply a more modern and rigorous process to build better portfolios for our clients,” he said. “I believe that portfolio construction is one of the fastest-growing opportunities in the industry and an area where we can really differentiate BlackRock.” Age: 52

"Why Jim Yong Kim’s move has shaken up the World Bank","The departure of the bank’s head raises questions about its future amid Trump administration suspicions of international institutions","© Bloomberg The day after suddenly announcing that he was ditching the presidency of the World Bank for a Wall Street private equity firm, Jim Yong Kim made an appearance before staff to muster an explanation. In the packed atrium of the bank’s headquarters, just two blocks away from the White House, Mr Kim said he was leaving three years earlier than expected to take a lucrative job that sounds similar to his World Bank role — helping the private sector finance infrastructure projects in emerging markets. “This opportunity came, and, you know, it is very hard to predict when these things come to you in your life,” he said.  The 59-year-old former academic and health official then dashed off because he had “a lot of phone calls” to make, leaving other top officials to field remaining questions. Many in the audience — with whom Mr Kim had repeatedly clashed since taking the reins of the World Bank as Barack Obama’s appointee in 2012 — left unsatisfied. “The town hall didn’t clear up a thing,” one World Bank employee lamented. Mr Kim’s abrupt, voluntary exit has not only triggered confusion and frustration for staff at the bank, but raised profound questions about the leadership and the future role of an institution that has been a centrepiece of the US-led international economic order. The selection of the next World Bank president is set to be in the hands of Donald Trump, who is openly sceptical of multilateral institutions © AFP Created in the aftermath of the second world war in conjunction with the IMF to help reduce global poverty, the World Bank’s influence has been waning as it has faced growing competition from private sources of capital and from regional development banks and much more assertive bilateral lending by China to many poor countries. While the World Bank lent $64bn in fiscal year 2018, some estimates have pegged Chinese lending overseas at several multiples of that.
 Moreover, since it has traditionally been led by an American, it is now facing the prospect — much sooner than many inside the Bank could fathom — of a new president chosen by Donald Trump, who has been openly sceptical of multilateral institutions and could attempt to reshape the way it operates.  A World Bank president chosen by the Trump administration could, in particular, try to limit its financing of projects intended to tackle climate change, as well as any work that is seen as supporting the building of Chinese infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative — and may insist on other big course corrections as well. “I think frankly right now people in the bank are worried about how do we protect the institution,” says one former senior World Bank official. The World Bank lent $64bn in the fiscal year 2018, though estimates pegged Chinese lending overseas at several multiples of that © Bloomberg That an American will lead the World Bank is likely but not a given. Its board has launched a selection process, vowing that it should be “open, merit-based and transparent” — meaning it would not necessarily be tied to nationality. Some observers have hoped that Mr Kim’s early exit could be the opportunity for the world to coalesce around an alternative candidate, finally breaking the gentleman’s agreement that allows the US to choose the head of the World Bank and Europeans to manage the IMF.  But others say that may be wishful thinking. David Dollar, a former World Bank official and US Treasury emissary to China who is now at the Brookings Institution, says if there were an attempt by other countries to block America’s nominee it could backfire.  “It is a very complicated game,” he says. “My instinct is that there is a very strong likelihood that the US nominee will be approved. The world has an interest in the US staying engaged with the World Bank.”  Possible names are already floating around Washington, including David Malpass, a current top Treasury official on international affairs, 
Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the UN, Mark Green, head of the US Agency for International Development, and even Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. A Treasury department spokeswoman says it has received “a significant number of recommendations for good candidates” and was “beginning the internal review process” to make its selection. David Malpass, the top Treasury official on international affairs, is said to be in the running for the World Bank job © Bloomberg Still, people familiar with the process say a contest could yet materialise. Among possible emerging market alternatives are Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian economist who challenged Mr Kim for the job in 2012, Donald Kaberuka, a Rwandan economist and former president of the African Development Bank, and Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesian finance minister. Whoever emerges as the winner will have to grapple with Mr Kim’s thorny legacy. When he was plucked from the presidency of Dartmouth College in 2012 to lead the bank, the Korean-American had little previous experience in finance or public service. Yet Mr Kim plunged the bank into a major internal shake-up to get rid of the “silos” within the institution and encourage more sharing of information. However, the effort was met with opposition from many staffers, and morale dropped. “His botched reorganisation has been reversed piece by piece,” says one senior World Bank staffer. “The walls are just as firm as they ever were, if not stronger.” Resistance to Mr Kim within the organisation became so strong that the Staff Association opposed his re-election campaign in 2016, and even after that people close to the bank say some staffers continued to openly criticise Mr Kim over both his management style and ideas for the organisation. “He was an introvert, he did not engage, he was largely invisible,” the senior staffer says.  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian economist, challenged Mr Kim for the World Bank job in 2012 © Bloomberg Some of Mr Kim’s personnel decisions also ended up being problematic. Former chief economist Paul Romer left last year after just 15 months in the job following his own clashes with staff on grammar and methodology in World Bank research and reports.  Yet while Mr Kim was making enemies internally, he was notching up some significant victories externally. One was to secure the replenishment of funds for investments in the poorest developing economies. But his main accomplishment was to secure a $13bn capital increase for the World Bank after a tricky negotiation with the Trump administration that included curbs to staff salaries and was helped by his support for a women’s empowerment fund championed by Ms Trump that revealed some well-honed diplomatic skills.  “When the Trump administration came in people were wondering what the America First strategy would mean for the World Bank and he was strongly aware of that,” says Judy Shelton, the US executive director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. “But right away he worked out the deal with Ivanka Trump . . . right away she had a partner in him and I thought that was very smart.” Ivanka Trump, the US president's daughter, is another name floating around Washington as a potential successor © AFP Though the capital increase has yet to be approved by Congress, it has put the World Bank on a much more stable financial footing that should ensure its relevance in the years to come.
 “Many people thought there would be no support for a capital increase and yet it happened,” says Andrew Rogerson, senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute in London. “You can’t say the World Bank is under desperate pressure at the moment: it’s big, it’s diversified, and it’s being pulled in various directions by its owners to do more and more and more,” he adds. Even on the outside, Mr Kim could end up ruffling feathers at the bank, given that his new job is likely to overlap heavily with his previous role — in fact it appeared designed to do so.  Mr Kim is joining Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm managed by Adebayo Ogunlesi, a former top banker at Credit Suisse. While it is not a big investor in emerging markets now, Mr Kim hinted that after a one-year cooling off period designed to avoid conflicts of interest, he will be working closely with the World Bank.  One former senior World Bank official says that if Mr Kim were to work on any projects related to China’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative, this could raise many eyebrows in a Washington that is obsessed about competition with China.  “Kim has been promoting BRI over the objections and unhappiness of a lot of the bank staff and the US Treasury. I hope he’s not going to get involved in that kind of dealing,” he says. GIP has not disclosed how much Mr Kim will earn as a partner, but should that emerge it could trigger a new backlash over his departure.  “If you are really worried about climate and gender, why cash out when you could be working on it at the largest institution that does this?” asks one foreign official in Washington. After the first disorienting days of the week, World Bank insiders are at least comforted that Mr Kim was not pushed out but jumped ship for his own reasons. Some say that he had already started to check out a few months ago, leaving much of the day-to-day management to Kristalina Georgieva, the widely-admired former EU commissioner who is the World Bank chief executive and will take over as interim president.  “He disappeared from sight while he was looking for something else,” says one staffer.  However, Mr Kim did launch one major initiative in October, with the creation of a “human capital” ranking of countries to measure their spending on health and education.  Ultimately much will depend on what the Trump administration decides to do in picking its candidate for the job. Ms Shelton says there should be nothing to fear: “The Trump administration doesn’t reject multilateralism, it embraces multilateralism that works. It would like to see the bank work better.”","11.01.2019"
"Economists predict the UK economy’s trajectory in 2019","The FT polled 81 economists about prospects for 2019","The UK economy had a tumultuous 2018, with growth slowing, the Bank of England raising rates to the highest level since the financial crisis and pay rising faster than inflation. This year promises to be even more turbulent, with the UK due to leave the EU in March — but with the details surrounding its departure yet to be agreed.  The FT asked 81 economists to peer into their crystal balls and answer a variety of questions about the economy this year. Overall, they were pessimistic about 2019, with almost all forecasting that uncertainty around Brexit will hobble economic growth in the short term. Most said it was impossible to make any forecasts with certainty; those who ventured predictions said that growth would likely remain at its current, lacklustre level of 1.5 per cent.   Here are their responses to six questions about the economy. To what extent will Brexit-related uncertainty in the first quarter of the year affect the UK economy? Howard Archer, chief economic adviser, EY ITEM Club
 Markedly. Confidence indicators for December show weakened consumer and business sentiment amid heightened Brexit uncertainties . . . This looks certain to weigh down on business investment in particular and, likely in many cases, to result in caution over committing to major new business/contracts. Consumer caution is also likely, especially in relation to purchases of big-ticket items. The housing market is likely to be muted. Much will depend on how Brexit matters develop through the first quarter. If there is a lack of progress in the early weeks of 2019 and it looks like a “no-deal” UK exit from the EU is becoming more and more likely, the negative impact on the economy will be magnified. However, there could be some limiting impact on how much GDP growth (or lack of growth) is affected by stock building as businesses look to protect their supplies. There could also be some element of consumers making precautionary buys of some items. Alternatively, if it looks ever more likely that a “no-deal” exit will be averted, some of the uncertainty may ease, although it is unlikely to disappear completely until it is absolutely guaranteed there will be a deal. Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics, LSE
 Considerably, given uncertainty about (a) which route to Brexit (or not) is taken and (b) the uncertainty associated with the chosen route, eg if there is a second referendum, uncertainty about the result. Ray Barrell, professor, Brunel university
 Growth will continue to stagnate until the situation over Brexit becomes clear. Output will rise, fall, or remain the same as projected depending on which of the exit or stay options arrives. Marian Bell, Alpha Economics
 In the face of continuing Brexit-related uncertainty, businesses have scaled back investment in the UK and made decisions to move operations overseas. By the third quarter of 2018, cumulative GDP growth since the referendum was 1 percentage point lower than had previously been expected. Business is now being told to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and increasing numbers will relocate some operations. These decisions may not be reversed, even in the event of the best possible outcome for the economy, which would be to remain in the EU. The damage done to the UK economy by allowing Brexit-related uncertainty to rise going into the first quarter is likely to be long lasting. Neil Blake, global head of forecasting, CBRE
 A lot. Danny Blanchflower, professor, Dartmouth College
 I think uncertainty is one of the major issues in 2019. Businesses are surely going to sit on their hands in terms of investment — either deferring until later or moving elsewhere. Maybe consumers will start to precautionary save for what is coming. Either way this looks bad. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy, Imperial College
 At best a drag on investment and marketing — at worst (hard Brexit) panic leading to 3 per cent fall in GDP over 2019 George Buckley, chief UK and euro area economist, Nomura
 The outcome of Brexit is still a big unknown. There are four main options: i) May’s deal, ii) another deal (eg. Norway for now), iii) no deal or iv) remain. In the case of the latter two, uncertainty could increase materially — either in the long run (no deal) or in the shorter term as another referendum question is unlikely to be decided quickly. This uncertainty is most likely to be felt in investment — business investment has already fallen for three consecutive quarters, something which hasn’t happened since the crisis. To the extent that uncertainty shows up in sterling, that could further add to import prices and inflation, thereby reducing real consumer spending. Sarah Carlson, Moody’s Investors Service
 Declining investment is a major reason why the UK is the only major economy whose growth has slipped far below trend. We think that persistent uncertainty over Brexit will continue to dampen long-term investment, business expansion, and economic activity. Jagjit Chadha, director, National Institute of Economic and Social Research
 Uncertainty related to EU exit takes a number of forms: in terms of the type of exit, when we exit and indeed whether we exit. We also do not know how our trading relationships for goods and services, as well as capital and labour, will evolve for the rest of the world on exit. So even if the first set of uncertainties are resolved in some manner in the first quarter of next year, the second set of uncertainties could still weigh on activity that depends on forward-looking plans. Such uncertainty has already depressed domestic investment and probably impacted on inward FDI and so, to some extent, seems likely to continue to do so. David Cobham, professor, Heriot-Watt University
 To a significant extent: it seems we can already see this in the lowish retail figures for the Christmas quarter. Brian Coulton, chief economist, Fitch Ratings
 Yes, business investment and consumer spending will be subdued, even if there is resolution before March. If it goes right to the wire then the impact will be deeper. Diane Coyle, Bennett professor of public policy, University of Cambridge
 Significantly. It already is of course. Apart from slower UK growth compared to other OECD economies, the fall in the pound raising the cost of imports will have done at least as much to hammer the high street as other factors like business rates or online competition. Uncertainty has a chilling effect on investment, hiring and spending plans at the best of times. This is not the best of times. It’s hard to believe any business in Britain will sign off on new investments or expansion at present. Of course there might be a short-term boost to sales of essentials before the end of March; I for one am stockpiling, given the number of our politicians who seem to think a no-deal exit is no problem. Bronwyn Curtis, independent economist
 In the short term it will be most of the small to medium-sized companies who have, until now, expected that the government will negotiate something sensible. They are not prepared for a sudden transition and will spend time in Q1 focusing on Brexit rather than building their businesses. Consumers have already pulled back and we will see the impact of that when the Christmas spending numbers come in. The fall in spending will not be reversed in Q1.  Large businesses have already made their decisions and moved whatever they can into the EU, “just in case”. Wealthy individuals have also moved to shelter their assets. This will hurt the economy medium to long-term as these are mostly the biggest taxpayers, but the impact will be spread over time.  Howard Davies, chairman, RBS
 The impact on investment, in particular, could be quite severe, unless a deal is ratified at the beginning of January. Panicos Demetriades, professor of financial economics, University of Leicester
 I cannot envisage any scenario under which Brexit-related uncertainty will disappear in Q1. If a people’s vote is agreed, it will not happen in Q1. If the UK exits under Mrs May’s deal on 29 March, uncertainty will continue because details are still not finalised — the agreement with the EU is more of a statement of intent than an accurate description of Britain’s future relationship with the EU. In the worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit, uncertainty, if anything, will be massive. Wouter den Haan, professor, LSE
 UK political uncertainty is ridiculously high right now. That cannot be healthy, obviously. Parliament accepting the negotiated deal would help in terms of reducing uncertainty, but lots of uncertainty will remain and that isn’t a good thing. Swati Dhingra, associate professor, LSE
 Slowdown like earlier, low GDP growth relative to other OECD countries. Dampening of investments. Hard to predict numbers here because short-term forecasts are not the most reliable but direction likely to be negative Peter Dixon, economist, Commerzbank
 With little likelihood of a meaningful parliamentary vote until mid-January, which will almost certainly result in a rejection of the withdrawal agreement, we could soon be looking into the abyss from a business planning perspective. For many companies it will be too late to take meaningful measures to avoid a hard Brexit and they will have to do what they can to brace for impact in the hope we never actually get there. This does imply that investment will be frozen but on the other hand we might see a lot of inventory build-up in Q1. Many households may not even be aware of the severity of the situation, so we could find ourselves in a strange environment in which the media’s dire warnings are not fully reflected in the economic data. Noble Francis, economics director, Construction Products Association
 The increased level of uncertainty in 2018 Q4 has already led to an increase in stockpiling and a sharp fall in major investments, although small investments in IT and equipment continue. This will continue in January and the increase in stockpiling will provide a small boost to GDP due to the impact on inventories but this is likely to be offset by further falls in business investment. What happens after January will be dependent upon a Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU that also passes through the UK parliament. Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, LSE
 I expect inventory accumulation to offset any reduction in fixed investment, so that the UK economy will continue to grow slowly at somewhere between 0.25 and 0.5 per cent, quarter on quarter. Andy Goodwin, associate director, Oxford Economics
 Uncertainty is likely to work in both directions in Q1. On one hand, uncertainty around the future trading relationship with the EU is clearly discouraging companies from investing and will continue to do so until parliament finds a resolution to the current impasse. But, on the other hand, the longer that parliament takes to approve the withdrawal agreement, the more likely it will be that companies stockpile to guard against the risk of disruption after March 29. On balance I suspect there will be a small drag on activity. Mark Gregory, chief economist, EY
 We may see a range of potentially contradictory effects with companies spending to prepare and to stockpile, especially sectors like food and life sciences but we can also expect domestic business investment to fall and foreign direct investment to go on hold. The key, as always, will be how consumers react but with both the UK and global economic news worsening, Brexit is likely to exacerbate the fall in consumer confidence. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics
 Given that there are still numerous ways in which Brexit could unfold, Brexit uncertainty — which we estimate has knocked around 0.5 percentage points off GDP growth since the referendum — seems unlikely to subside anytime soon. Meanwhile, stockpiling ahead of Brexit probably won’t provide much of an offset. Even if stockbuilding picks up in early 2019, it only makes sense for firms to stockpile imports that might be disrupted after Brexit. As a result, the effect on GDP growth would be neutral. Overall, the lack of clarity is likely to see quarterly GDP growth slow sharply to just 0.3 per cent in Q4 and remain subdued in Q1 2019. Rebecca Harding, chief executive, Coriolis Technologies
 The government’s advice to business at the end of 2018 has been to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. In a sense, this removes the economic uncertainty: the UK economy now has to brace itself for a hard landing. Businesses have to be ready to trade with the EU and the rest of the world as a third country under WTO rules, with a scant and temporary safety net for aerospace, logistics and financial services until the end of the year. Yet while the UK’s trade will be slower in Q1, this is not because of its imminent exit from the EU. It will be slower because the uncertainties surrounding trade finance have been evident for some time. A trade finance arrangement is typically for 90-120 days with shorter term financing in place for 30 or 60 days. With Brexit now dangerously within this timeframe, and with the government suggesting that everyone prepares for no deal, the existing constraints on trade finance will inevitably become barriers. No business, and no bank, will be prepared to take the risk of funding projects now without knowing the full costs of the finance. What has been a hidden slowdown in trade finance has the potential to become a full lockdown by the end of the first quarter as Brexit day approaches. John Hawksworth, chief economist PwC
 There is already considerable evidence from business surveys that Brexit-related uncertainty has been affecting business investment significantly in recent months. More tentatively, there are some indications that consumer confidence and spending have also been adversely affected in the run-up to Christmas, although hard data on this is lacking so far. The housing market has also continued to slow, particularly in London. We would expect these negative effects on business investment, the housing market and possibly also consumer spending to persist and indeed probably intensify in the first quarter of 2019 so long as a disorderly Brexit with no transition remains a significant possibility. Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist, Société Générale
 It will materially reduce growth in both consumer and investment spending below the levels that would otherwise have been reached. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist, BNP Paribas
 There are no signs that uncertainty, which has weighed heavily on firms’ investment decisions over recent quarters, is letting up. Moreover, the situation could get worse, before it gets better. The outlook is becoming increasingly binary, with Theresa May’s deal unlikely to get through parliament, leaving a choice between “no deal” or “no Brexit” on March 29, 2019. Growth at the start of Q1 may remain subdued, given that parliament will only be voting in mid-January and there does not appear to be a majority yet for a specific plan B. Firms may have to start implementing (if they have not already) their no-deal contingency plans, which could include shifting labour and production abroad, or stockpiling goods, which would boost imports and drag on growth. But there is scope for a re-acceleration if, and when, uncertainty clears. Ethan Ilzetzki, lecturer, LSE
 Much of this uncertainty has already been priced in and has already affected the UK economy, reflected in lower growth than comparable economies in the past two years. Uncertainty likely peaked this month and the remaining effects will be the real effect of Brexit if and when it occurs. Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist, BCA Research
 The uncertainty of a “no-deal” Brexit is akin to the uncertainty of a hurricane brewing in the Atlantic. If the hurricane ends up missing, you won’t feel it at all. And if the hurricane hits, you’ll only really feel it when it is almost upon you! Stephen King, senior economic adviser, HSBC
 A tricky one to answer for the simple reason that Brexit is such an extraordinary turn of events. Following the post-WW1 collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the trams in Vienna stopped running because the creation of new borders brought the supply of coal from the north to a juddering halt. In the event of a “no-deal” Brexit arrangement, we may belatedly discover how sensitive modern economies are to global and regional supply chains. And even if there is a deal, there may still be a lack of clarity on future trading relationships. Economically, at least, the UK is likely to be worse off under all forms of Brexit compared with the alternative of remaining in the EU. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist, Joseph Rowntree Foundation
 We have the paradoxical situation of the imminence of a no-deal Brexit also increasing the chance of no Brexit at all. So, whilst the prolonged uncertainty will reduce long-term investment decisions, and future growth potential, it may not have a dramatic short-term effect on the economy as bets go both ways in the early part of the year. Ruth Lea, Economic Adviser, Arbuthnot Banking Group
 I would expect some further, fairly modest easing in business investment (say 2 per cent in the quarter). It should be noted that, despite some anecdotal evidence of major postponements of business investment in recent quarters, the ONS’s recorded data have shown very modest falls overall, arguably within measurement error. Consumers and potential housebuyers could also hold back, but it will be difficult to disentangle any such developments from the usual noise in the first quarter, when large seasonal factors can distort underlying consumer spending figures and the weather can also have major effects. I would expect little impact on government spending or, indeed, exports. All in all, there could be a very modest impact on GDP in 2019 Q1 and, hence, the labour market which is proving (surprisingly?) resilient despite the Brexit uncertainties  John Llewellyn, Llewellyn Consulting
 Considerably. Businesses, and especially those that sell into Europe, will contain their investment until they know the terms on which they will be able to export there. Consumers have kept their spending going by saving less. That would have come to an end anyway; and now Brexit seems to be making them more cautious. There is also a lack of clarity of the context in which the government will have to budget. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist, Netwealth
 The outlook for the economy depends upon the interactions between the fundamentals, policy and confidence. Brexit uncertainty will impact via policy and confidence. The economy could easily come to a standstill in the early months, as political uncertainty overshadows all else. As raw politics may dominate in early 2019, one has to keep options open regarding Brexit and economic policy. The most likely Brexit scenarios appear to be either: an acceptance of the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement, most probably with a change to the backstop for parliament to accept it. Indeed, as the possibility of no deal becomes more likely, then there may be an increased likelihood of the EU offering an enhanced offer to the UK. Here there would be a transition agreement, which while not removing uncertainty, would ease the pace of adjustment; or a managed no deal or exit on WTO terms, which would likely involve agreement during the first quarter on sector specific deals. While uncertainty would likely persist until the end of March, this might be alleviated sooner if it was clear the UK and EU were preparing post March to reach a free trade agreement, as I think they would.  In the event of a managed no deal, one should expect plans to be in place for monetary and fiscal stimulus in the second quarter. While increased preparation in the first quarter for a managed no deal may trigger some increased business spending it is hard to quantify fully this likely impact and it is likely to be offset by a delay in other spending plans. Likewise, it is hard to forecast the impact of any uncertainty, particularly as that should keep sterling competitive and encourage the Bank of England to have a bias towards easier policy — although in all likelihood they will likely keep policy on hold in the first quarter.  It is not just Brexit uncertainty, but the currently negative mood overhanging global financial markets, that may weigh on spending and investment plans, leading to a deferment of these.  Stephen Machin, professor, LSE
 Much of the uncertainty has already been factored in, but more recent events and extra uncertainty associated with that may magnify the effects we have already seen: upward pressure on price inflation, firms cutting back on intangibles like worker training and overtime, and associated negative effects on firm productivity. Chris Martin, professor, Bath university
 A lot; the effects will be felt throughout next year. Costas Milas, professor of finance, University of Liverpool
 To be plain, quite badly. Let me elaborate: Mrs May has struck a deal with our EU partners which is a compromise. Brexiters are moaning that the deal is too bad for us and urge Mrs May to negotiate a (much) better deal. Are they kidding themselves and the rest of us? If the deal is too bad for us, it should be quite good for the rest of the EU. With this in mind, why on earth would EU leaders come back to the negotiating table when they have already won? Rational behaviour is also quite thin when it comes to parliament. Some are dreaming of a free vote which will allow our parliament to choose among . . . multiple solutions and ‘guide’ the government towards the most sensible(?) one. Add to all of the above the prospect of conditional referenda (in Latin) or referendums (in English). Notice that we cannot even agree on what the plural of referendum is. How on earth will we then be able to deal with . . . multiple choice referendum questions as many suggest? Sadly, all of the above point to a unique conclusion: we are sleepwalking towards a no-deal Brexit which will hit our economy badly. David Miles, professor, Imperial College
 The short run impact in holding back some spending may be significant. But its impact beyond a couple of quarters is itself likely to be small. Allan Monks, UK economist, JPMorgan
 The intensification in Brexit uncertainty is affecting both household and business confidence. Businesses have already cut back their investment sharply, at a time when the estimated net rate of return on investment remains high by the standards of the past decade. The deterioration in household expectations of their personal finances is striking given the strengthening in their real income growth recently (from lower inflation, higher wages and job growth) and suggests fears of no deal are pulling down confidence. Andrew Mountford, professor, Royal Holloway
 Economic theory as well as common sense suggests that more uncertainty will lead to delays in investment decisions as well the incurring of additional costs — insurance — to mitigate this uncertainty. Both these effects will be operating in the first quarter of 2019. Jacob Nell, chief UK economist, Morgan Stanley
 We expect an endgame slowdown, and forecast weak GDP growth of 0.1 per cent in both Q4 2018 and Q1 2019. This reflects our view that the lack of political consensus in the UK on Europe — mirrored in the lack of a parliamentary majority for a particular course of action on Brexit — would lead to a protracted period of elevated political uncertainty in the Brexit endgame, which would deter investment and slow consumption. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist, CBI
 It all depends what happens in January. If the withdrawal agreement is successfully ratified, then some of the near-term uncertainty will lift, and firms will be able to start investing again. But investment growth will be subdued as it will take time for clarity on the post-Brexit UK-EU trading relationship to emerge. But if as we approach the end of March, a ‘no deal’ looks likely, we’ll start to see a big impact on the economy. Firms are already having to put contingency plans in place for a no-deal Brexit and more of these plans would turn into reality with jobs and investment in the UK lost. Over the longer-term what matters is the relationship we will have with our most important trading partner, the EU. If we have more trading frictions with our nearest neighbour, this will lower our growth and productivity. In any event, with uncertainty looming over the UK economy, we’re likely to get off to a rocky start in 2019. Charles Nolan, professor, Glasgow university
 As things stand, Brexit-related uncertainty looks set to dominate more than just the first quarter of 2019. Rather than Brexit being a more-or-less determinate period of elevated uncertainty, it has become essentially open ended. Andrew Oswald, professor, Warwick university
 Probably a fair amount. Further stockpiling can be expected. Land prices may well rise near port areas (to allow lorry parking). Falls in stock markets, and generalised uncertainty about jobs and incomes, will probably lead to consumers holding back on major purchasing decisions. David Owen, managing director and chief European economist, Jefferies
 A lot. Clearly much will depend on what happens with the meaningful vote and whether the Labour leadership comes off the fence and calls for a second referendum, but one cannot rule out the case that Theresa May continues to take it to the wire, with uncertainty spiking. More companies could be triggering contingency plans which are then not reversed, including moving some of their businesses to the continent, other companies will be building inventories, other decisions could be on hold. It should also be remembered that if Theresa May wins the meaningful vote (on perhaps the second attempt) it still needs to be enshrined into UK law, requiring further debate and amendment. Markets are likely to be particularly volatile with confusion rife. Tej Parikh, senior economist, Institute of Directors
 Economic growth is already expected to have slowed markedly under the weight of uncertainty in the final months of 2018, and now, businesses who had hoped to start the new year with investments, new hires and product launches are likely to put them on hold, which continue to drag on the economy. Ann Pettifor, director, Policy Research in Macroeconomics 
 The main effect of Brexit to date is to depress business investment. This will undoubtedly continue to stagnate or fall. Given a slowing global and European economic context, the UK will continue to lag behind comparator economies. If it becomes clear in Q1 that we are heading towards a chaotic Brexit, then consumer and business confidence will obviously slump and will continue further. John Philpott, The Jobs Economist
 Until the precise Brexit trajectory becomes clear, net business investment and private sector net hiring will be weak. Consumers will also remain cautious. If uncertainty persists down to the wire of 29 March, economic growth is likely to stagnate in the first quarter. Kallum Pickering, senior economist, Berenberg
 Despite the heightened uncertainty, real GDP growth is likely to remain stable in Q1 at roughly the Q4 rate of 0.3-0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter. While the risk of hard Brexit is likely to weigh on investment, the same risk will probably lead to higher stockpiling by firms and households, boosting consumption and production. These two trends will roughly offset one another. Christopher Pissarides, Professor, LSE
 There will be a moderate increase of uncertainty-related behaviour over present levels, which are already large. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy, King’s College, London
 Brexit-related uncertainty has already affected the economy, with essentially no growth during the past few months; we may already be in recession. I would expect — absent a speedy resolution which seems unlikely — the impacts to spread from large businesses to consumers and business more generally. Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser, Centre for Economics and Business Research
 Quite significantly. Clearly the outcome of the vote on the withdrawal deal in early January, assuming this time it goes ahead will be important but if it fails to get parliament backing it will throw many more uncertainties into the mix. The past year has seen Brexit uncertainty mentioned increasingly as one of the main reasons for reduced optimism and depressed demand in many sectors — from services to car manufacturing, even now to consumer pessimism which has fallen to the lowest in five years despite record employment. Business investment fell in each of the first three quarters of 2018, manufacturing was in recession in the first half and has shown only a small and intermittent improvement since and confidence by the sector is at its lowest for decades despite the pound’s weakness. It is hard to see how sentiment will turn. If the withdrawal deal is voted through then business can at least expect a period of calmness during the transition but so much will still be left unsettled and business and consumers will remain cautious. Sonali Punhani, UK economist, Credit Suisse
 Brexit uncertainty is already having an impact on the UK economy. Activity and optimism have slowed down to subdued levels and have caused companies and customers to cancel or postpone spending and investment decisions. This is likely to continue in Q1 until there is clarity on the path of Brexit and even accelerate as we move closer to the deadline of 29 March 2019. Ricardo Reis, LSE
 It depends on whether there is a meaningful vote in the Commons right at the start of January or not. If we reach the end of January still without a clear sense of what the trade restrictions and regulatory framework facing firms in just three months will be, then it is hard to see this not having a negative effect on the economy in the first quarter. Right now, there is a significant chance of a “hard Brexit” in four months’ time, the outcome that almost everyone, from politicians to economists, from Brexiters to remainers, thinks will be terrible for the economy. Until that leaves the table, it is hard to see too many firms willing to seriously invest. Philip Rush, founder and chief economist, Heteronomics
 Ongoing uncertainty in the Brexit process necessitates an intensification of precautionary activity. Some of this will require shifting spending abroad as part of contingency planning, but there should be an offsetting effect in inventory accumulation. Overall, I doubt there will be a significant depressing effect on the headline data from uncertainty alone. Yael Selfin, chief economist, KPMG
 Brexit-related uncertainty in Q1 is likely to affect the UK economy in two opposite directions. On the one hand, business investment and households’ purchases of big items could be further postponed. At the same time, contingency measures are likely to be stepped up, boosting activity. Philip Shaw, chief economist, Investec
 An obvious issue is that we still do not know which Brexit regime it is that we are heading towards. In terms of the short-run, it is possible that the UK fails to enter a 21-month implementation period after March and hurtle out of the EU without a deal. Meanwhile, the shape of Britain’s longer-term relationship with the EU remains as unclear as ever. Our baseline view is that the government will avoid “no deal” and will begin to hammer out a trade framework during the spring. But the risks of either a messy exit or an Article 50 extension (which would prolong the uncertainty) are growing. It is easy to envisage Brexit related question marks weighing further on business investment and therefore the economy as a whole over the start of next year. Andrew Simms, co-director, New Weather Institute
 It is hard to overstate the potential impact of the Brexit bridge-collapse on not just the UK economy, but its cultural climate and quality of community life. A wave of disingenuous commentary has claimed that previous negative warnings were wrong because “they haven’t happened yet”. On one hand, rather obviously, that’s because “it hasn’t happened yet”, but of course there are clear, discernible, signs of damage already. Business investment is shrinking, real wages stagnant, and even the brief boost from sterling’s depreciation after the referendum would seem to have run out with news that the UK’s current account deficit rose in the last quarter. Just as damaging as some of these practical economic realities, however, have been the messages coming from political leaders. From the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson’s, contemptuously insulting dismissal of the reasonable fears of business, to the former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab’s hilariously detached and blithe admission that he didn’t realise the economic importance of the Dover-Calais trade link to Europe, we have been witness to a technicolour display of incompetence that would be comic if it were not so critical. If an administration set out, wilfully, to create uncertainty and undermine confidence in the UK economy it could hardly do a better job. Nina Skero, director and head of macroeconomics, CEBR
 Economic growth is set to slow in Q1 2019 as uncertainty dampens business investment, consumer expenditure on big-ticket items and housing market activity. The economic uncertainty is compounded by a fragile political picture. An early general election which could see a Corbyn-led government is still a possibility. This will further discourage investment into the country. Andrew Smithers, author
 Much less than the FT likes to assume. The impact on supply potential is almost zero so far and the impact on demand is probably limited to corporate investment, where it is largely used as an excuse for bonus-driven low investment. Gary Styles, director, GPS Economics
 This is extremely difficult to assess. I expect quarterly output growth could be around 0.2 per cent lower than otherwise due to the widespread uncertainty. The postponement of investment and consumption decisions and trade upheavals are likely to dominate economic activity adjustment during 2019. Suren Thiru, head of economics and business finance, British Chambers of Commerce
 Brexit related uncertainty is likely to weigh significantly on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2019 through weakening business confidence and stifling investment intentions. Brexit uncertainty together with moderating growth in key export markets and persistent trade tensions are also likely to limit the contribution of net trade to UK growth. Subdued real wage growth and declining consumer confidence is likely to squeeze household expenditure. As such, UK GDP growth of just 0.2 per cent is likely in the first quarter of 2018.  Phil Thornton, director, Clarity Economics
 The economic impact will depend on the level of political chaos and specifically the outcome of the Commons vote on Theresa May’s Brexit in the week of 14 January. Whatever the outcome there will be three main channels for the economy: the impact of uncertainty on consumer spending; the impact of uncertainty on business investment; and the businesses’ decisions on opening operations in the EU. If May’s deal passes, the impact will be relatively low. If the deal falls then the impact on consumer and business spending will be high — although ironically a rush by firms to make plans for EU investment might boost UK GDP in that first quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics
 The adverse impact of Brexit uncertainty built over the course of 2018 as the March 2019 deadline approached. By Q3, business investment was 2.2 per cent lower than in the final quarter of 2017, while retail sales likely stagnated between Q3 and Q4. Measures of both business and consumer confidence ended 2018 at multiyear lows, so the omens for Q1 GDP are not good. That said, the sharp fall in oil prices will boost households’ real incomes, while we continue to think that the prime minister eventually will have to opt for a “Norway-plus” style Brexit in order to get a deal through parliament, leading to a sharp recovery in economy-wide confidence late in Q1. As such, we doubt that GDP will contract in Q1 and look for a modest 0.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter gain (the same as we expect in Q4). Kitty Ussher, economist and former Treasury minister
 There will be volatility affected by perceptions of political risk. Should no deal be reached by parliament then there will be a short-term collapse in confidence similar to that experienced in the weeks after the referendum itself, with medium-term effects on order books and the real economy at least until trading arrangements are clarified and, depending on the detail, possibly for a significant period of time afterwards. John Van Reenen, professor, MIT economics department and Sloan management school
 It will affect it negatively, especially over investment and hiring (as it is currently doing). Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist, TS Lombard
 It will keep consumers in defensive mode and postpone the hoped-for rebound in business investment, holding private demand down. With the rest of the world set to slow in 2019, risks to the growth outlook are skewed to the downside in the first quarter. Daniel Vernazza, chief UK and senior global economist, UniCredit
 Brexit-related uncertainty is likely to weigh more on the UK economy in the first quarter. Of course, much depends on when — and if — there’s more clarity on Brexit, but I expect the ratification process will go down to the wire, as all sides first seek to exhaust the other possibilities. Business surveys have already weakened materially and firms are delaying investment in larger numbers, which is entirely rational, particularly given that more clarity — good or bad — should not be too far away. Partly offsetting the negative effects of uncertainty in the first quarter, there could be a temporary positive impact on UK GDP from the front-loading of consumption. Consumers may bring forward purchases, particularly of major items, in order to avoid a rise in prices in the event of a disorderly exit stemming from a depreciation of sterling, supply shortages and possible tariffs on EU imports. Given the likelihood of supply shortages arising from stoppages and delays at the border, another reason for front-loading would be to safeguard supplies. The same is true for imports, which would have an offsetting, negative impact for GDP in the first quarter. Keith Wade, chief economist, Schroders
 Significantly, there is every incentive to delay major purchases until 29 March. Business investment, housing and durable goods will be most affected with the result that GDP could decline. Martin Weale, professor, King’s College
 As things stand now, I expect very considerable uncertainty. But the impact of uncertainty on the economy is not well-defined — sometimes it matters and sometimes it does not. Taking the combination of Brexit uncertainty and weaker growth on the continent, I would not be surprised if the economy does not grow in the first quarter. Simon Wells, chief European economist HSBC
 Consumer confidence is at a five-year low, important service-sector indicators have fallen and the eurozone has slowed sharply. The signs for Q1 are not great. Peter Westaway, chief economist, Vanguard Asset Management
 The performance of the UK economy will be dominated by Brexit-related concerns as firms and households continue to hold off on their spending until the fog of uncertainty lifts. As a result, growth in Q1 is likely to be barely positive. Matthew Whittaker, deputy director, Resolution Foundation
 Hugely. We’re already seeing businesses and consumers in something of a holding pattern, waiting to see what happens next. That’s likely to continue through the first quarter. Indeed, even when some clarity arrives, it’s likely to take people a long time to work out quite what it means and so settle on a new equilibrium. Mike Wickens, professor, University of York
 It won’t affect consumption — it might even increase it if people decide to increase stocks as a precaution — but it will continue to deter investment. This will continue until the future trading relations are determined. The next three months are unlikely to be especially significant for investment as it looks further ahead. Trevor Williams, visiting professor, University of Derby
 Greatly! It is safe to say that as actual Brexit approaches, much of the complacency about its impact is dissipating fast. Businesses are now planning for hard Brexit and indeed for the Brexit deal — both have negative consequences for investment in the year. I would not be shocked if growth was flat or slightly negative in Q1 2019. Alastair Winter, chief economist, Daniel Stewart & Company
 I would expect the worst part of the uncertainty to be cleared by the end of January. The elimination of no deal, “managed” or otherwise, will have a beneficial economic effect but more likely to come through in Q1 in consumer and business confidence surveys rather than hard data from the ONS. Plans for increased public spending will be expected if not yet announced by the end of the quarter. Garry Young, NIESR
 According to the Bank of England’s decision maker panel, business uncertainty about Brexit spiked up in the latest figures for August-October. No doubt it has increased more since then and will continue at a very high level in the first quarter and probably beyond. The evidence suggests that this uncertainty has been responsible for lower investment than would otherwise have been the case as businesses have deferred spending until the Brexit outcome becomes clearer. I would expect this to continue, weakening both demand and supply in the short term. To some extent the effect on demand will be offset by greater stockpiling ahead of Brexit, but I doubt that supply will make up the ground lost and productivity will remain weaker than it might have been. A lot will depend on the outcome of the Brexit withdrawal deal vote on January 14. If that passes, then there will be a transition period until the end of 2020 which will give a bit more certainty. But, if it doesn’t, then there will be heightened uncertainty that will likely dampen business investment. But, by the same token, the greater likelihood of leaving on March 29 may speed up business spending on contingency planning in the first quarter of the year. Azad Zangana, senior economist, Schroders
 High uncertainty has already started to weigh on corporate sentiment and investment decisions, and it looks like this is spreading to the household sector. As we approach the deadline, we may also see greater volatility in markets, especially in the pound. Name withheld
 Outcomes are becoming more extreme (between hard Brexit and a new referendum with stay) rather than converging (say the fine tuning of a negotiated deal) to be potentially resolved in a short time span (March 29?). This will condition many economic decision makers. In any event, a lot of harm is already done. Even a stay will not bring back the 2016 mindset. How will Brexit affect the UK economy over the course of 2019? Howard Archer, chief economic adviser, EY ITEM Club
 Heightened Brexit uncertainties will weigh down activity in the first quarter. Assuming a deal is agreed, the economy should pick up to a limited extent due to diminished uncertainty. Consumer spending should be supported by a gradual improvement in consumer purchasing power as earnings growth firms modestly and inflation eases back overall during the year. Meanwhile, business investment should benefit from ultimate agreement on a Brexit deal and it is also likely to be lifted by some firms looking to increasingly invest in automation to make up for labour shortages and try to boost productivity. But ongoing uncertainties about the longer term UK-EU relationship are likely to limit the upside for business investment. Meanwhile, net trade is likely to offer little help to growth as the sweet spot facing UK exporters is further diluted by slowing global growth and a firmer pound after a Brexit deal. On this basis, we expect GDP growth of 1.5 per cent in 2019. However, if the UK does end up exiting the EU without a deal next March, growth in 2019 is likely to come in substantially lower (probably around 0.5-0.75 per cent) as major uncertainty hits consumer and business sentiment and investment. Sterling would likely fall sharply. This would push up input costs for businesses and cause inflation to rise markedly, thereby squeezing consumer purchasing power. But the weaker pound would boost UK exports. Trade will also be affected as both parties levy tariffs and non-tariff barriers are introduced across a range of sectors, although, with both export and import growth suffering, the effect on GDP growth from this source would be ambiguous. We would expect the Bank of England to respond by cutting interest rates and the chancellor to provide some fiscal stimulus to help growth. Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics, LSE
 Negatively, at least until such time that both of the following have happened: A “sensible” Brexit choice, eg second referendum result is Remain; a result that does not cause uncontained political conflict. If only one of those outcomes eventuates, or neither, adverse effects will continue throughout 2019. Ray Barrell, professor, Brunel university
 There appear to be four options and outcomes for 2019, so on average output will fall by 0.5 per cent. That will not happen, but one of the below will. 1) Leave with no deal and move to zero tariffs. Barriers to trade with Europe will have to rise immediately, and output will fall 4 per cent as a result of disruption. 2) Leave with no deal but change nothing immediately. Regulatory and tariff alignment remain, but foreign firms will start to leave. Output will fall 1 per cent at most. 3) Leave with about the existing deal. Alignment remains, and so do foreign firms. Output will remain flat. 4) Stay. Output will rise 1 per cent as foreign firms put productivity-increasing changes in place that have been delayed for three years. Marian Bell, Alpha Economics
 Given the current heightened level of uncertainty over the shape of Brexit and the substantial risks involved, it is difficult if not impossible to predict the path of the UK economy. The damage done to the UK economy by allowing such uncertainty to continue may not be completely reversible, even if the country decided to stay in the EU. Neil Blake, global head of forecasting, CBRE
 A weak Q1. Bounce back in H2 if a deal is agreed. Danny Blanchflower, professor, Dartmouth College
 Obviously depends on the nature of the Brexit but the UK is slowing, Europe is slowing and by mid-2019 I suspect the US will be also, driven by a major [Federal Reserve] error in raising rates along with a trade war. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy, Imperial College
 Hard Brexit will bring a rush to the exit as companies shift activities to the EU. The 40 per cent of total UK trade which goes to the EU is not evenly spread across all companies — there are a sizeable number specialised in EU trade which must move. Announcements about moves and plant closures will lead to confidence collapse, which will slow growth for years to come. Even with May agreement, the two-year transition will brake activity, with uncertainty about longer term trading relationships. The cumulative effects from years of prolonged uncertainty are being ignored. Brexiters ignore the timing problem — effects on current EU trade are immediate — it would take time for trade agreements outside of the EU to make up the loss. George Buckley, Nomura
 Whatever the outcome, ongoing uncertainty will keep a lid on economic growth for the time being — particularly investment but to a lesser extent consumer spending. A no-deal would mean a sharp recession and, in our view, a loosening of monetary policy (rather than the mechanical tightening that the BoE suggested). If a deal with transition is passed that could end up unlocking business investment, and appreciation of sterling, higher consumer confidence and spending — albeit under the circumstances of a global slowdown which is unlikely to pass the UK by. Another referendum ending up with a Remain vote would raise uncertainty in the near-term but would be supportive of growth further ahead. Sarah Carlson, Moody’s Investors Service
 Our forecasts assume that a “no deal” Brexit will be avoided, but that growth will still remain below trend at 1.6 per cent. However, should the UK exit the EU without a deal, we think that we will see a sharp depreciation in sterling and the economy will enter a recession as temporarily higher inflation puts a squeeze on real wages, and in turn, weighs on consumer spending and overall economic growth. Jagjit Chadha, NIESR
 Any form of exit seems likely to depress activity compared with the case in which the UK remains in the EU. The greater the disruption to trade, the greater the negative long-run impact, which also has a differential regional impact and is strongest where European partners are best able to provide substitutes. The economy has already started to adjust this long run and on exit will continue to do so. The most likely case of an exit on terms that introduce limited frictions will continue to subdue economic activity below where it would otherwise be. But because the impact is likely to affect both the demand and supply side it does not create a prima facie case for more accommodative monetary policy. David Cobham, professor, Heriot-Watt University
 If May’s deal gets through parliament, not so much. But if it does not, then there will be continuing turmoil and uncertainty through the year with depressing effects on investment and consumption (and no serious end to austerity). Brian Coulton, chief economist, Fitch Ratings
 It all depends on how the politics plays out. If there is some resolution or fudge which kicks the can down the road then there could be a recovery in growth and a sterling rally as immediate uncertainty eases. But in the case of a cliff-edge no deal the impact could be quite damaging. It’s virtually impossible to model the potential impacts using traditional forecasting frameworks. We have tried to illustrate a plausible scenario by calibrating it on the experience of the UK during the fuel protests nearly 20 years ago which had a big impact on disrupting supply chains etc. That suggested something akin to the early 1990s recession. But it really is very uncertain. Diane Coyle, Bennett professor of public policy, Cambridge university
 If the Brexit negotiations had been moderately competently handled, the UK economy would have performed somewhat worse than it otherwise might. Given the political shambles we’ve had instead, the outlook is anything from lacklustre to catastrophic, but who knows? Bronwyn Curtis, independent economist
 Even if there is no Brexit, growth will be lower than it might have been because businesses have held off investing in their businesses in the UK since the Brexit vote. There will be a “no Brexit” bounce in sterling markets and business investment, but growth will still be lower than it would have been as businesses that have relocated to the EU will not reverse those decisions. Growth may be about 1.5 per cent.  So far, much of the uncertainty over Brexit has been reflected in sterling volatility. A “no deal Brexit” would see sterling hit and I wouldn’t be surprised to see sterling at parity with the euro. The fear factor would be high and the newspapers would be full of shortages and disruptions. Somewhat perversely, sterling may bounce as foreign investors see the possibility of a “cheap deal” and hot money may flow in.  Growth would be lower, inflation higher and the Bank of England will hike rates. I’d also expect to see fiscal policy loosened. Perhaps a cut in VAT?  “Brexit with a deal” would see a short-term positive response on sterling, business investment and consumer spending as there is now some certainty about the withdrawal. However “the devil is in the detail” and, as that is revealed, the reality will elicit a negative response from businesses and households. Services trading costs are likely to rise somewhere between 5 per cent and 10 per cent and services are more important than goods to UK trade. The Bank of England may hold rates, but fiscal policy will still be loosened under the guise of helping small businesses adjust. The reality is that it will be a political gesture in case a general election has to be called. The greatest harm to the economy may be political as the turmoil continues and the possibility of a general election rises.  Howard Davies, chairman, RBS
 Decisions on investment, delayed as a result of Brexit uncertainty, have been made. Whatever happens that will depress growth. If a very soft Brexit — Norwegian style — were to be agreed, there could be a quick rebound. Panicos Demetriades, professor of financial economics, Leicester university
 Brexit-related uncertainty will not come to an end very easily unless there is a people’s vote in which Remain prevails. Even if the UK exits on March 29 following Mrs May’s deal, uncertainty will continue until the end of 2020 while negotiations continue to finalise all the details, as well as the all-important question of Northern Ireland. Wouter den Haan, professor, LSE
 Who knows, I definitely do not. There are so many possible time paths that could be followed. Swati Dhingra, associate professor, LSE
 Depends on the outcome of the negotiations. Negatively in general, with greater slowdown in the event of a no deal. Big challenge is services sector which does not figure prominently in the current deal. Peter Dixon, economist, Commerzbank
 Everything depends on the type of Brexit. A disorderly outcome will not bode well for activity in April and we could be looking at an outright recession in 2019, coupled with a sharp depreciation of sterling with all the attendant inflationary consequences. In the more likely scenarios where the no-deal outcome is avoided but the hard decisions are merely postponed, I would expect more of the same — in other words, growth below pre-referendum rates with consumption and investment remaining weak and policymakers remaining trapped by the spiral of general economic uncertainty. Noble Francis, economics director, Construction Products Association
 Clearly, a lot depends on whether Theresa May can get her draft Brexit Withdrawal Agreement through in mid-January (or if it fails on the first occasion and gets through on a second vote in late January). Most macroeconomic forecasters, and the markets, have assumed a deal. If a deal passes through the UK parliament, then we are expecting UK GDP growth of 1.4 per cent in 2019 and the stockpiled materials and products should be released, easing supply and price inflation in Q2 and Q3. In addition, economic growth should be boosted as business investment rises due to increased certainty in the short term and a greater degree of optimism over an agreement between trading relations between the UK and EU post-implementation period and potentially an extension of the implementation period.  If the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement fails to get through the UK parliament and “no deal” becomes the most likely outcome, expect a sharp fall in sterling, increases in import prices and a sharp fall in business and consumer confidence. Government, for all its technical notices since July, businesses and households remains thoroughly unprepared for “no deal”. A sharp fall in UK GDP during Q2 and Q3 would inevitably occur before systems adjust. Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, LSE
 We do not know, because we do not know what kind of Brexit outcome will emerge from the fog. Andy Goodwin, associate director, Oxford Economics
 It depends on whether parliament approves the withdrawal agreement! If Brexit is orderly then to some extent it will be back to business as usual, although firms who are heavily dependent on exporting to the EU will remain reluctant to commit to major investments until there is greater clarity on the future trading relationship. If Brexit is disorderly then we would expect to see significant disruption to trade and a 10 per cent depreciation of sterling, with policymakers forced to loosen fiscal and monetary policy to try to soften the blow. The UK is likely to flirt with recession in mid-2019 in a “no deal” scenario. Mark Gregory, chief economist, EY
 Even if we sign a withdrawal agreement, I don’t believe this will unleash a spree of business investment. The UK is going to be approached generally on a “care and maintenance” basis by multinationals, just as France was for the last few years before Macron. The UK will therefore lose out on growth investment and we will see our competitiveness decline relative to our peers until we have a final trade deal. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics
 Our base case is predicated on the ratification of something fairly close to Theresa May’s deal in parliament in early 2019, paving the way for a 21-month status quo transition period. In this scenario, our expectation is that GDP growth will rise from just 1.3 per cent this year to about 2.0 per cent in 2019 and 2020, as a pick-up in real pay prompts a recovery in household spending growth and a lifting in Brexit uncertainty supports investment.  A “no deal” Brexit is the obvious downside risk, to which we assign a 20 per cent probability. We think that an orderly “no deal” Brexit in which agreements are struck on many issues including aviation, customs checks and visas, could knock about 1 percentage point off GDP growth. In a disorderly “no deal”, in which relations between the UK and EU break down and the UK leaves with minimal side agreements in place, the hit to activity could be as high as 3 per cent of GDP, with an outright recession probable. Rebecca Harding, chief executive, Coriolis Technologies
 The problem with the advice to plan for no-deal Brexit for the trade and trade finance sector is that many of the decisions that will be made during the first quarter of the year will be at best hard to reverse. Bank trade finance functions are already moving to Frankfurt and Amsterdam; the infrastructure to support transactions as well is the flip of a messaging switch away. During the course of 2019, the impact of decisions being made now and in the first quarter of 2019 will be felt on trade, particularly exports. This may not affect the global corporate in the first instance: these companies are funded through their own, open account, trade finance and will be able to move resources over time to manage their global operations efficiently. However, smaller businesses, because of the shorter-term nature of the financing that they require, and because they are relatively expensive to fund, will find it more difficult to access finance. This is already evident in surveys such as the Santander Trade Barometer, which suggest that there was a marked increase in the numbers of smaller businesses citing access to finance as a challenge to their international growth. Trade takes a long time to shift substantially and the impact of tariff changes, or even in shifting supply chains, will not be seen in the trade numbers in 2019 necessarily. But the small businesses at the end of global supply chains which most need financing to sustain employment and innovation and to allow them to grow, will be the first to be hit, with wages and employment security for the millions of people employed in them damaged. The effect on the UK’s small businesses will combine with existing pressures in the economy such as uncertainty, high levels of household indebtedness and rising inflation, to damp demand and investment. The effects may not be felt immediately on trade, but they will be felt in the real economy during the course of the year. John Hawksworth, chief economist, PwC
 Our main scenario assumption is still that, even if only at the last minute, a political solution will be found to avoid a disorderly Brexit with no transition at the end of March 2019. If a reasonably smooth Brexit can be achieved, then there could be a gradual revival in business investment over the course of the year. But UK growth is likely to remain moderate (ie below 2 per cent), particularly given an expected moderation in global growth next year as the US, eurozone and Chinese economies all slow down. If there is a disorderly “no deal” Brexit at the end of March, then it is highly likely that the UK would suffer at least a mild recession and possibly a severe one. The lack of any real historical precedent makes it very difficult to put precise figures on such a scenario. There are also plausible scenarios where Article 50 is extended, for example to allow time to hold a second referendum. This would extend the period of uncertainty and might be bad for the economy in the short term, but there could be longer term economic benefits if such a referendum produced a decisive vote in favour of remaining in the EU. However, this is far from guaranteed, so this is a higher risk option from a business perspective than agreeing a deal now. Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist, Société Générale
 See point 1. Once a deal is finally struck, which could take until the middle of the year, confidence should pick up and growth with it. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist, BNP Paribas
 The UK economy’s performance in 2019 depends entirely on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Should there be an “orderly” Brexit, we see scope for economic growth to gather momentum. There are three factors that should support the economy. First, there is scope for investment to recoup some of the ground lost due to Brexit uncertainty in 2018. Second, we expect a further strengthening in real wage growth, which should underpin relatively robust consumer spending. And finally, the outright fiscal stimulus announced at the chancellor’s Autumn Budget should provide a fillip to growth. However, should the Article 50 clock strike 11pm and the UK leave the EU without a deal, we see a significant front-loaded shock to the UK economy. A recession would probably loom, although support from policymakers as well as some pragmatic solutions to avoid disruptions, may help to mitigate some, but not all, of the shock. Ethan Ilzetzki, lecturer, LSE
 It is currently entirely unclear whether and how the UK will leave the EU. A disorderly Brexit will certainly have negative short- and long-term effects on the UK economy. I don’t expect other scenarios (current agreement, second referendum, postponement) to have an impact within the upcoming year, but these will have longer-term impacts. Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist, BCA Research
 In terms of the impact on the UK economy in 2019, Brexit is binary: “no deal” versus anything else. A “no deal” on March 29 would create a palpable shock to the economy, while the other outcomes — a deal with transition or a delay — would create an economic “relief recovery”. Stephen King, senior economic adviser, HSBC
 See answer to question one. I don’t buy the extreme interest scenario presented by the BoE in its worst-case Brexit scenario. Even if there is a negative supply-side shock with all sorts of unfortunate implications for the output gap, the political economy of Brexit is such that the Bank would surely be wary of throwing monetary fuel on a recessionary fire. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist, Joseph Rowntree Foundation
 I see little prospect of a definitive outcome for Brexit in the early part of the year. Theresa May’s deal postpones substantive questions about future trading relationships. If we are moving towards a no-deal exit, there is probably a parliamentary majority for a short-term measure such as extending Article 50 to avoid that happening. While this of course would be far better than a no-deal exit, it will prolong uncertainty. Finally, if support increases for a referendum that puts the whole enterprise in question, this will not happen quickly. There is likely to be a period of some months of campaigning, again prolonging uncertainty.  Therefore, Brexit-related uncertainty will be the dominant theme in the UK economy, reducing the willingness of businesses to make longer term decisions, but also giving hope to those who want to avoid Brexit and those who want to leave without a deal. However, there is a chance that we might have a clearer picture of longer-term outcomes towards the latter part of the year. In that case, we may start to see the economy begin to adjust towards those outcomes. Essentially the further away from the EU our likely long-term relationship, the higher the likelihood of inflationary pressures, reduced economic activity and increased fiscal pressure. Ruth Lea, economic adviser, Arbuthnot Banking Group
 My central case is for a “managed” no-deal Brexit, without a transition. There are increasing signs of preparedness for such an outcome in both the UK and the EU. Under these circumstances, I would expect some disruption to trade and business in 2019 Q2 and 2019 Q3, but business should have adapted (and got through the “teething troubles”) by 2019 Q4. GDP may even dip modestly in 2019 Q2 and 2019 Q3, but I would expect it to recover in 2019 Q4. In other words, the dip should be only temporary, assuming no damaging unforeseen circumstances, with relatively little impact on unemployment. Granted, the usual definition of “recession” is two consecutive quarters of falling output, but I would hesitate to refer to my expected “scenario” as a recession, preferring to confine the term to situations when there is a prolonged and damaging hit on GDP and employment, as in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s and the Great Recession. If, however, the Withdrawal Agreement “deal” is implemented (which I hope will not be the case), then there should be even less impact on the economy, as we will remain de facto an EU member during the transition period even though de jure we will have left.  John Llewellyn, Llewellyn Consulting
 That is unanswerable. It depends entirely on what happens re Brexit — ranging from a crash out to staying fully in. But any outcome other than remaining fully in will impose at least some cost on the economy, and that will cumulate for a number of years. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist, Netwealth
 This depends upon the agreement made and the path subsequently chosen. If there is an agreement, and thus certainty about what lies ahead, then there could be a deal dividend, as the chancellor has indicated. If there is a managed no deal then how this impacts the economy will depend, crucially, on planning and on any agreements made in the first few months of the year. Its impact will be greatest on those sectors currently enjoying frictionless trade with the EU but that could be minimised or indeed offset by expectation of a future free trade agreement. My forecast is for the economy to grow 1.5 per cent in 2019 and 2.2 per cent in 2020, helped by greater certainty about what lies ahead. Stephen Machin, professor, LSE
 It seems likely to continue to have negative effects which, as per my response to the previous question, may get magnified the closer the outcome is to no deal. The negative shocks are likely to have deleterious outcomes for workers and firms, especially if the exchange rate continues to depreciate. Chris Martin, professor of economics, Bath university
 Best guess: output and real wage growth 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent lower — inflation about 1 per cent higher. Brexit plus significant caps on migration will probably lower employment and real wages by up to 10 per cent over the next five years. Costas Milas, professor of finance, Liverpool university 
 Brexit is already taking its toll on business investment and, consequently, our economic prospects. Arguably, the only sensible way forward is a referendum based on a tweaked version of Mrs May’s Brexit deal and Remain. Please spare us the calamity of . . . multiple choice questions in a possible referendum. University students quite often have difficulty in dealing with (or answering) multiple choice questions in a standard university exam. Why do we want to “test” the “knowledge” of the whole population on this? We need to draw a line and move forward. A win for Mrs May’s deal will provide a mild “Brexit-dividend” boost. A win for Remain will boost the economy even further. Of course, there is also the risk of no-deal Brexit. Contrary to what Brexiters are telling us, this should bring our economy down. Please don’t underestimate the no-Brexit scenario. Our government is sleepwalking towards this one. David Miles, professor, Imperial College
 To answer that you need three things: 1) a set of possible Brexit outcomes. 2) a probability assessment of each. 3) a model of how the Brexit outcomes affect employment, investment, consumer spending, prices etc. Supplying any one of those three things is more a matter of guesswork than science. When economists have little useful to say on issues it is wise to say little. (See final comment below). Allan Monks, UK economist, JPMorgan
 The UK will continue to underperform relative to its main trading partners, especially in the first half of the year. The weaker currency is likely to push imported inflation back up and restrain real incomes, while business investment is restrained further. If the UK enters a smooth transition this could lead to a modest growth recovery in the second half, as firms with shorter investment horizons resume spending and real incomes improve. Fiscal policy will also provide an added boost to growth. A long delay in Brexit could also see some spending come back temporarily. But if there is a short delay with the near-term outlook still left very uncertain, growth is likely to remain subdued beyond March. Andrew Mountford, professor, Royal Holloway
 In addition to the actual costs of any Brexit in disrupting supply chains (as in eg. Baldwin) and in reducing the attraction of the UK for potential investors by being distanced from one of the world’s major single markets and unified regulatory structure, the costs of uncertainty will continue to depress investment and increase costs as described above until the uncertainty is resolved.  Simply passing the current proposed deal will not resolve this uncertainty. It will simply start the process of trade negotiations which will undoubtedly be volatile and likely long lasting. The same thing applies to a no-deal outcome. Even a new referendum which stops Brexit will not completely remove the uncertainty, although one would imagine only a knife-edge result wouldn’t settle the issue for the immediate future.  The extent of these costs to the UK economy is difficult to gauge but the decline in the value of the pound of 15 per cent gives an indication that they are substantial. Foreign exchange dealers expect there to be such a reduction in the demand for pounds in the future from people wishing to invest in the UK economy or buy UK goods that they think sterling is worth only 85 per cent of what it used to be.  This 15 per cent decline will be an average over future possible paths. I would expect a no-deal outcome to cause a further substantial decline in sterling and a cancelling of Brexit to cause an appreciation of sterling but not of 15 per cent, as some of the disruptive effects of the Brexit process will have had permanent effects. Jacob Nell, chief UK economist, Morgan Stanley
 In our base case of a last-minute soft Brexit, we expect Brexit uncertainty to weigh on economic activity at the start of the year. However, once a hard Brexit is ruled out and the UK is firmly on the path of a soft Brexit — probably from Q2 2019 — we expect a rebound, led by stronger business investment. However, we expect the rebound to be modest, given ongoing uncertainty over the future EU-UK relationship, and peg GDP growth at 1.3 per cent over 2019 as a whole. In our bear case of a temporary transition, with the lingering risk of hard Brexit, we would expect a weaker growth recovery after Brexit. In our bull case of a very soft Brexit or remaining in the EU, we would expect clarity later in the year, but then a stronger recovery. Our previous bear case was a no-deal Brexit, but we now see this scenario as low probability (only 5 per cent), given a parliamentary majority opposed to a no-deal outcome. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist, CBI
 Even if the Withdrawal Agreement is successfully ratified, Brexit and the nature of our future relationship with the EU will continue to affect business decisions. What matters most is what we determine to be our relationship over the long term. Charles Nolan, professor, Glasgow university
 It still remains far from clear what Brexit actually will mean. As such, it looks set to exert a depressive force across many sectors, softening business investment and further constraining productivity growth. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science, Warwick university
 Similarly to above. The additional possibility is that, if there is a very hard Brexit, confidence in the London housing market might deteriorate suddenly, as rich continentals flooded out of London. Our nation’s housebuyers have grown used to housing as a gloriously sublime one-way bet. If panic in the capital’s housing market were to set in by the winter of 2019, it is difficult to know where herd behaviour — down down rather than the usual up up — would eventually run out of puff. David Owen, managing director and chief European economist, Jefferies
 Obviously, the outlook could very different in a few weeks’ time, with the odds constantly evolving. We currently put the probability of “no deal” at 20 per cent (this includes after a second vote later in the year), 40 per cent parliament takes control (this includes remaining after a second vote, being parked in some form of EEA+, or revoking Article 50) and 40 per cent she gets her deal through. When thinking about the outlook for growth, monetary policy and sterling, we make use of weighted expected out-turns using the odds above. This suggests weaker growth than the consensus is expecting, higher rates and a weaker sterling. We do buy into the view that there could be a growth dividend if the uncertainty diminishes, but to the extent that more companies build inventories ahead of the event, these could be run down after March 29. And assuming the government wins the meaningful vote, attention will then switch more to the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and rolling over FTAs with other countries. Tej Parikh, senior economist, Institute of Directors
 If a deal can be struck, it should deliver a short-term boost to business and consumer confidence. But economic activity will remain restrained by ongoing negotiations on the future trading relationship with the EU and weak productivity growth. Ann Pettifor, director, policy research in macroeconomics 
 We can expect business investment to continue to decline, and for consumer and business confidence overall to weaken. A chaotic Brexit will feed into a UK economy already weakened by ongoing austerity, in which consumers and corporates are constrained by high levels of debt and households are running down their savings. A recession is therefore very likely. John Philpott, The Jobs Economist
 There is a Brexit-shaped hole in the economists’ crystal ball this year. Uncertainty surrounds the eventual divorce deal, let alone the demand and supply-side consequences of either a deal or no deal. The most one can realistically predict is that a no-deal Brexit risks short-term economic contraction, while agreement on any of the prominent deals currently under discussion (Plan May, Norway+, Canada+) offers the prospect of a short-term boost to growth as uncertainty subsides. However, an outcome I think possible is a political consensus in favour of rejecting no deal and instead extending Article 50 to allow for further consideration of alternative options, including a second referendum. If so, economic performance in 2019 is a repeat of 2018, with positive but modest growth. Kallum Pickering, senior economist, Berenberg
 All Brexit outcomes, ranging from the UK remaining in the EU to a damaging no-deal hard Brexit, are still possible. A softer Brexit would likely trigger a temporary acceleration in UK real GDP growth and limit the Brexit damage to long-term growth potential. An unmanaged no-deal hard Brexit would probably strike a severe short-term blow to UK and European economic activity and take a sizeable chunk out of the UK’s long-term growth potential.  Chances are, the UK will avoid a hard Brexit and the economy will improve in 2019. Just as the market consensus overestimated the extent to which the UK economy would soften after the Brexit vote, it is probably now underestimating the extent to which growth will pick up next year following a deal. Domestic fundamentals are in good shape. Driven by stronger consumption and business investment, UK real GDP growth can probably manage a rate close to 2 per cent in 2019. Christopher Pissarides, professor, LSE
 The effect will be mainly on investment and from there on growth, which should be affected, probably by a number close to 1 per cent but more likely 0.5 per cent. The effect will be bigger on exporting firms. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy, King’s College, London
 Assuming the worst-case (chaotic no deal) outcome does not materialise, uncertainty is likely to continue. That is, either Article 50 is extended or some version of the current deal is accepted, neither of which resolves the medium to long-term issues, but the current threat of a cliff-edge on March 29 is removed. This should improve confidence in the short term, but Brexit will continue to weigh on business investment for the foreseeable future. So while there might be a “relief bounce”, I wouldn’t expect a substantial “deal dividend”. No deal would almost certainly lead to a severe recession, although uncertainties are huge. Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser, Centre for Economics and Business Research
 We are likely to see uncertainty prevail during the year. The chancellor has injected some money into the economy, particularly through raising personal allowances and the higher income tax threshold and offering some more investment incentives, and the OBR upping its forecast to 1.6 per cent for the year reflects this. But it assumes calmness ahead and a transition period to follow from exit from the EU at the end of March.  All this may be thrown into the air — everything is possible including an extension of Article 50, revoking of Article 50, a referendum, a general election, other options like an EEA. The probability of each of these options is difficult to assess at this stage but I would exclude a “no deal” as it will simply in my view not be allowed to go through against the will of parliament. However, as uncertainty is prolonged, businesses and consumers will sit on their hands or even retrench. The lack of investment will continue to affect the UK’s productivity, innovation and also long-term growth prospects. For both small and large firms alike, the intended tightening of immigration outlined in the immigration White Paper published just before Christmas will act as a further disincentive. Sonali Punhani, UK economist, Credit Suisse
 In 2019, the economic outlook depends on the path of Brexit negotiations. If the UK and EU agree on a deal, leading to a smooth Brexit and a transition period by March, risks are for growth to be higher than our forecast of 1.5 per cent. This is on the back of the fiscal stimulus announced in the Autumn Budget as well as a likely rebound in growth due to the deal being agreed. Ricardo Reis, LSE
 It depends on what type of Brexit it is. A resolution of uncertainty could boost the economy, as pent-up investment that was delayed in the past year or two finally gets off the ground. Moreover, a people’s vote that cancels Brexit entirely would likely give an important short-run boost to the economy. Philip Rush, founder and chief economist, Heteronomics
 Assuming, as I do, that the UK shifts into the agreed transitionary phase, nothing changes for the economy in 2019. Uncertainty about the ultimate trade deal and domestic politics will persist, but that merely means maintaining existing trends rather than breaking back higher or crashing lower. The UK’s representative consumer is apparently called BoB — thoroughly Bored of Brexit. Yael Selfin, chief economist, KPMG
 The impact of Brexit on the UK economy in 2019 will depend to a great deal on the type of exit the UK has. While prospects of a smaller and less internationally connected economy would depress business investment, the removal of uncertainty about the form of Brexit should see an acceleration in investment in the short term as government and businesses adjust. Philip Shaw, chief economist, Investec
 If a transition period is agreed promptly next year, this would probably give business investment a helping hand. A prompt and clear line of sight on a managed Brexit would in our view be non-disruptive to the economy in 2019. “No deal” would hit the economy, but the extent of the impact would depend on the precise shape of the trading arrangements — a common mistake is to consider no deal to be one scenario, whereas in reality the term hides a multitude of sins. A prolonged Article 50 extension risks the economy turning the UK into a chronic uncertainty zone, which becomes a place to avoid investing into. But non-Brexit factors should be considered too. The past two Budgets are about to inject a considerable amount of fiscal stimulus into the economy, while wage growth is picking up. On a base case view that a deal is agreed early in 2019, GDP growth should be stronger next year than this. Andrew Simms, co-director, New Weather Institute
 Obviously the effect of Brexit depends entirely on what actually happens to it, and whether it happens at all, making any confident, particular projections impossible. That said, this very uncertainty, almost inconceivable so close to the date set by the government to leave the EU in March, is a clear indication that the confidence fairy is unlikely to be sprinkling any magic dust over UK plc in the next 12 months. All the things typical of an economy gripped by a high level of uncertainty, therefore, are likely to characterise the UK.  Coyness by the government in publishing and being transparent about their own assessments of the economic impact on the UK’s future, glimpsed only dimly through this veil of doubt, is explained by what we do know. Brexit poses a kind of comprehensive uncertainty, because it implies fundamental realignment, rather than resulting from a single economic shock or geopolitical event. And, even “normal”, single source uncertainty is associated with falling investment, delayed decision making, negative employment effects and greater volatility in markets. Some of these patterns are already playing out with both UK investment abroad, and inward investment heading down.  So much, so bad, but potentially worse is how the all-consuming nature of the Brexit debacle has rendered government incapable of addressing urgent policy questions such as “future proofing”, by laying the foundations for a low carbon, resource efficient and high-employment UK economy. Nina Skero, director and head of macroeconomics, CEBR
 In the long term it is still unclear if Brexit will be net positive or negative for the UK economy. But in 2019, Brexit will be either bad or awful for the UK economy. There is about a one-in-four chance that the UK will leave the EU without a deal, meaning that the complete lack of clarity on post-Brexit arrangements will persist for longer. Business investment is set to be held to the bare minimum as firms wait for the situation to crystallise. Businesses have been stockpiling, boosting their inventories in preparation for a no-deal Brexit. Using up these inventories over the coming quarters will act as a further drag on growth in 2019. Andrew Smithers, author
 It depends on the outcome. The choices are May, Stay and Crash, with a second referendum as a possible way of deciding. Crash would I think have a marked negative impact on demand and would push up inflation. May would be positive through relief and Stay even more so. Gary Styles, director, GPS Economics
 For the first half of the year Brexit uncertainty is likely to be a significant drag on economic activity and confidence. Thereafter, any possibility of bounceback will largely depend on the nature of the final deal. With a clear decision from parliament and a reasonable degree of confidence that it will not unwind and output growth could look much stronger by the end of the year. However, if parliament moves towards another referendum or indeed more uncertainty the economy will suffer further setbacks in 2019 and 2020. Suren Thiru, head of economics and business finance, British Chambers of Commerce
 Persistent Brexit uncertainty is likely to mean a turbulent 2019 for the UK economy. The political and economic turbulence caused by uncertainty over Brexit is likely to weaken business confidence and the value of sterling further, dragging on key drivers of UK economic growth — notably business investment, consumer spending and trade.  The contribution of business investment to UK GDP growth is expected to remain downbeat as the increased uncertainty over Brexit weakens business and consumer confidence and stifles investment activity. Consumer spending is expected to be more limited as the weaker pound drives higher imported inflation over the near term, stifling real wage growth. A weakening currency is also expected to hinder rather than help the UK’s net trade position by increasing imported input costs, while a slowing global economy will limit export demand. Against this backdrop, the UK economy is likely to grow by about 1.3 per cent in 2019 — well below the historic average. Phil Thornton, director, Clarity Economics
 So much depends on the path that Brexit takes. Clearly May’s deal getting the green light will have a different impact from a no-deal exit, from a decision to have a second referendum, and from pushing for a Norway-style deal. But any outcome will mean greater uncertainty for consumers and businesses over the future shape of our relationship with the EU and so lower growth than the likely 1.3 per cent GDP growth for 2018. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics
 Considerable scope remains for business investment to rebound if a Brexit deal is signed off. The Withdrawal Agreement unlocks an 18-month no-change transition period with an option to extend it by two years in the likely event that a comprehensive trade deal has not been agreed by December 2020. Firms currently hold cash equal to 37 per cent of GDP on their balance sheets, up from 34 per cent since 2016. Not all of that extra cash will be spent, as firms also might not be investing due to the risk of a Corbyn government. But a hefty share of the cash likely will be deployed, given that margins are healthy, borrowing costs are low and capacity constraints are biting. Accordingly, we expect GDP growth to pick up to an average rate of 0.5 per cent in the final three quarters of 2019. Kitty Ussher, economist and former Treasury minister
 It will be the dominant story until the medium-term arrangements are resolved. This will affect market confidence. However, any effect on the real economy will be limited in the near-term as this uncertainty has already become a way of life — unless there is a no-deal Brexit, which will have an immediate effect on confidence and order books until clarity is achieved. John Van Reenen, professor, MIT economics department and Sloan management school
 It depends on what kind of outcome we see. A “no-deal” Brexit would be highly damaging as numerous reports have now shown, for example, the recent CEP/IFS report. But the important thing is to realise that ALL types of Brexit are economically and politically damaging to the UK (and to a lesser extent the rest of the EU). The government itself has recognised this and the impact is spelt out in my earlier work.  If the UK is in a transition period following the Withdrawal Agreement, the impact will not yet have fully played out because the real damage comes if the UK leaves the single market and customs union, which is potentially after the transition period ends. So if May’s deal gets through, then although there will be losses from uncertainty and expectations of being poorer in the future, the main damage is still to come. Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist, TS Lombard
 The big picture is that of an economy transitioning to a lower-growth equilibrium, marked by deficient domestic demand. Political instability only makes matters worse: the longer it persists, the bigger the drag on economic activity and the higher the likelihood of a sterling-induced jump in inflation.  Daniel Vernazza, chief UK and senior global economist, UniCredit
 Assuming an orderly Brexit, the immediate Brexit cliff-edge risks around March 29, 2019, will be avoided, and the associated reduction in near-term uncertainty should lead to some pick-up in business investment after firms delayed decisions in 2018 over Brexit. With zero spare capacity in the UK economy, GDP growth will be limited by its potential of around 1.5 per cent (reduced partly as a result of Brexit). In the unlikely event of a “no deal, no transition” Brexit, UK GDP would fall sharply, the magnitude of which is impossible to estimate precisely. Neither side is prepared for “no deal”. There would be stoppages and significant delays unless customs checks were not enforced and there were “grandfathering” of the required regulatory licences. Inflation would rise because of a fall in the value of sterling, supply bottlenecks and, if the UK were to choose a WTO tariff schedule similar to that of the current EU schedule, higher tariffs. Keith Wade, chief economist, Schroders
 Assuming that an agreement is reached then the economy should begin to grow again as delayed expenditure comes through. Otherwise, there will be more weakness which would be potentially severe in the event of a hard Brexit where there could be considerable dislocation to trade and supply chains. Martin Weale, professor, King’s College
 That of course depends how Brexit turns out. If there is a third referendum, there will be a great deal of uncertainty ahead of the vote, and a vote to leave with no deal would be likely to be damaging, as would of course leaving with no deal without a new vote. The most favourable outcome in economic terms would be a clear Remain majority in a third referendum. Even then, with the economy at capacity and productivity growth slow, we should not expect growth of more than 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Simon Wells, chief European economist, HSBC
 If or when more near-term clarity emerges, two judgments need to be made: how quickly will business investment rise and will the fall in inward migration accelerate? The former will probably be modest as long-term uncertainty will remain. If immigration continues to fall in a tight labour market, we could see faster wage growth and, in turn, a more hawkish Bank of England. Peter Westaway, chief economist, Vanguard Asset Management
 The performance of the UK will be largely determined by the outcome of the Brexit shenanigans in parliament. In my view, the most likely outcome (at around 70 per cent probability) is either some kind of compromise deal of the Theresa May variety, perhaps a close cousin, or maybe even a Norway-type soft Brexit. Next most likely is the cancellation of Brexit altogether (at 25 per cent probability). Any kind of deal will probably result in a rally in markets and an improvement in consumer sentiment. A reversal of Brexit would cause an even bigger surge, augmented by rising real incomes as real disposable incomes rose following a sharp increase in sterling. Any of those scenarios would lead to a much stronger prospect for UK growth in the second half of 2019 compared with the current consensus, perhaps as strong as 2 per cent. Only in the disastrous but rather unlikely no-deal scenario (at less than 10 per cent probability) would the pessimistic recessionary forecasts come to pass. Matthew Whittaker, deputy director, Resolution Foundation
 The big unknown! Much will of course rest on what Brexit means come March 29. A no-deal exit would almost certainly spark a disruptive recession, and we must hope that the prospect of this is enough to ensure that political pragmatism wins out. Brexit in line with the PM’s deal carries its own uncertainties, but it will at least provide a baseline against which businesses can start planning. With activity having been somewhat subdued over recent months, we might even enjoy a mild “rebound” of sorts. And with firms facing tightened labour supply — both because of low unemployment and more restricted access to EU migrant workers — we must hope that it serves as a tipping point for investment. But more likely it will act as a headwind, as firms spend time working out “what next?” and continue to tread carefully against a backdrop of continued uncertainty. Mike Wickens, professor, University of York
 There are two crucial factors: the short-term disruption due to a no deal and the longer-term uncertainty until the final arrangements are clear. But the downsides are unlikely to be as bad as the Bank’s scenario assessments or the Treasury’s forecasts, which are very unlikely to be near the mark — like their earlier assessments which were based on a flawed set of assumptions and incompetent econometric analysis. Trevor Williams, visiting professor, University of Derby
 Negatively and the more the UK leaves without a deal the greater the impact. In a no-deal scenario the UK economy will shrink, by as much as 2 per cent. In a deal scenario then the UK economy could expand by 1 per cent. There is a supply-side hit to investment and from lower migration and a bit to demand from consumers cutting back on spending and saving more. Alastair Winter, chief economist, Daniel Stewart & Company
 Quarter one already looks set to be soft in respect of all the components of GDP (0.3 per cent quarter on quarter), except perhaps a flurry of spending on contingency plans by both the government and business. The increasing prospect of remaining in the EU should release pent-up domestic and foreign business and investment as the year progresses and consumers may well start to increase their spending, especially if house prices start to turn around. “No deal” is most unlikely but if stumbled into would almost certainly cause a recession lasting into 2020. Garry Young, NIESR
 This obviously depends on how the UK actually leaves the EU, if it does. A plausible central expectation is that we leave roughly on the terms agreed by the prime minister with the EU. The effect of that on the economy in 2019 will depend critically on whether it ends the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. There has to be a concern that the unpopularity of the proposed deal and the apparent lack of political support for it will mean that uncertainty persists and the economy continues to limp along at its recent lacklustre pace. That will be much better than leaving with no deal, especially if that is disorderly. The best but unlikely outcome for the economy in my view would be for a convincing political consensus to build around a soft Brexit that resolves the current crisis, thereby ending the uncertainty and allowing government and business to get on with other pressing issues. Linda Yueh, adjunct professor of economics, London Business School
 Brexit will affect the UK economy through investment, consumption and government spending. In the first quarter and potentially first half of the year if Brexit day is delayed, uncertainty and contingency planning will affect investment as described in my previous answer. In the second half of the year, uncertainty over the future trade relationship will probably still affect long-term investment decisions. Consumption is also likely to be affected. Consumer decisions, particularly with respect to larger items, are influenced by how confident they feel about their economic prospects, which depends to some extent on Brexit. Finally, government spending will probably rise as departments increasingly take over functions such as trade policy that had been done by the EU. Azad Zangana, senior economist, Schroders
 We expect a poor start to the year due to Brexit uncertainty. Assuming the UK leaves the EU with a transition period, then we forecast the economy to rebound from the second quarter. There is a significant amount of pent-up demand, especially among corporates which have delayed investment and projects. We forecast GDP to pick up to 1.4 per cent in 2019. However, without a Brexit deal and a transition period, the economy could go into recession. Name withheld
 I expect little or no investment in the coming months (except for investment that prepares for contingent outcomes). Housing will probably pick up after a resolution, though it will depend on which is the outcome. If there is a hard Brexit, things might start to look ugly with logistics problems and shortages. After a long squeeze, real wages are finally rising. Will households feel better off at the end of 2019? Howard Archer, chief economic adviser, EY ITEM Club
 Modestly, but not hugely. There is likely to be a modest further pick-up in earnings growth following improvement in the latter months of 2018, while inflation is likely to fall back further in 2019 helped by the recent sharp falling back in oil prices (we see consumer price inflation averaging 1.8 per cent in 2019, down from 2.5 per cent in 2018). Earnings growth has seen a pick-up in the latter months of 2018, although it is still relatively muted compared to long-term norms (both headline and regular annual earnings growth was 3.2 per cent in the three months to October, the highest for a decade). We expect to see only limited further gains in earnings growth despite the tight labour market. Firms remain generally keen to limit their total costs in a challenging and uncertain environment. Fragile consumer confidence will probably deter workers from pushing hard for markedly increased pay rises despite recent higher inflation and a tight labour market. While survey evidence indicates that labour market tightness is pushing up starting salaries and pay for people switching jobs, other surveys indicate that employers currently appear to be still only offering modest pay increases for their existing staff. Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics, LSE
 On average yes, in terms of real income. However, given the variance of outcomes, not all households will be better off in terms of real purchasing power, and feeling better off depends on perceptions as well as reality. Thus the effect is likely to be limited and patchy. Ray Barrell, professor, Brunel university
 Probably consumers will feel worse off, but that depends on the Brexit deal. We must not rule out stubborn-headed idiocy making consumers significantly poorer in a zero tariff no-deal exit. They can only guarantee to have a good chance of feeling better off if we stay in Europe. Marian Bell, Alpha Economics
 See above. Neil Blake, global head of forecasting, CBRE
 Rising real wages are offsetting the impact of rising debt. If interest rates rise they will more than offset the impact of rising real wages. Danny Blanchflower, professor, Dartmouth College
 Better off than when is the question. Real wages in 2019 are still 5 per cent less than they were in Feb 2008, so the small rise in real wages will not be enough to make them fell better. And if there is further Brexit, slowing real wages will fall further as unemployment and inflation both rise. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy, Imperial College
 Not a big enough increase and for families much will be taken by rising council tax. By the middle of the year there will be anxiety about job losses and rising unemployment. Household confidence will be lower at the end of the year as a 3 to 5-year period of low growth kicks in. George Buckley, Nomura
 Yes. Inflation is likely to fall further thanks to lower oil prices and wage growth could accelerate due to the UK having the tightest labour market among its peer group (based on OECD estimates of the equilibrium unemployment rate). Employment, however, may not increase at the same strong rates as in the past given already-high participation rates. So aggregate incomes may not rise as quickly as real wages do. There is also a risk, in the case of a dramatic Brexit, of GDP falling and unemployment rising. Sarah Carlson, Moody’s Investors Service
 The UK’s productivity growth remains weak, and without an upturn in productivity a sustained increase in real wages is unlikely. Jagjit Chadha, NIESR
 The annual rate of increase in real wages, although material at 1 per cent per annum, is not really sufficient to leave the average household feeling that much better off. The recent buoyancy in consumption has been accompanied by a dwindling savings ratio and increased unsecured debt. Overall household debt at some 125 per cent of GDP suggests that households have been maintaining consumption levels by borrowing from a richer future. So even if that arrives, one should expect households to pay off some debt rather than increase consumption. The fundamental key to wealth and feeling significantly better off is a sustained improvement in labour productivity. David Cobham, professor, Heriot-Watt University
 This seems unlikely: a) sterling depreciation and inflation may work more or less strongly in the opposite direction; b) there will be a lot of households that won’t experience a genuine rise in their real wages; c) there will be a lot of households that still remember the (much) better times 10 years ago. Brian Coulton, chief economist, Fitch Ratings
 In the event of a smooth transition there should be some relief on the real wage front. But consumer debt levels have increased quite a bit in the past few years and household financial balances (savings minus investments) have moved into an unprecedented deficit. This limits the scope for a consumer rebound even if incomes pick up. Diane Coyle, Bennett professor of public policy, University of Cambridge
 Not in general, not unless there’s a political miracle. Not to mention all the households on benefits and fixed incomes, the people needing food banks or sleeping rough. Large numbers of our fellow citizens are struggling. Bronwyn Curtis, independent economist
 Households are unlikely to feel better off at the end of 2019. Higher real wages will be driven by the shortage of foreign workers, not because UK businesses are doing well and hiring. On the expenditure side, mortgage rates won’t fall and food and transport prices will probably be higher. There is little room for optimism on house prices either, as these seem set for a further fall in 2019. Howard Davies, chairman, RBS
 A little, as long as petrol pump prices keep falling. But only if they spend the whole year in the UK!  Panicos Demetriades, professor of financial economics, University of Leicester
 It all depends on the value of the pound which, in turn, depends on which of the three Brexit scenarios prevails in the end. Under a no-deal scenario, real wages will decline sharply in 2019 as the value of the pound will fall and inflation will increase, putting pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates. If there is a people’s vote and Remain prevails, the value of the pound will rise, inflation will be subdued and real wages will increase. There will be less pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates. Under the scenario of Britain leaving on 29 March under Mrs May’s deal — which seems to be the least likely at the moment — any change in real wages is likely to be small, on average, although the change in immigration rules can cause labour shortages in low-skilled professions that may result in a rise in real wages in some low-skilled jobs. Wouter den Haan, professor, LSE
 The sad thing about Brexit is that progress elsewhere will be overshadowed by dismay over the political chaos both in terms of Brexit having an actual negative effect on people’s economic situation and on people’s perception of their overall wellbeing. Swati Dhingra, associate professor, LSE
 No, the rise is too small to offset a slowdown in economic growth in the event of a Brexit deal that does not do much on the services front and results in increases in prices from higher trade barriers. Peter Dixon, economist, Commerzbank
 Not sure I would go that far. After all, consumer sentiment has weakened this year even though real wages and incomes are rising, and wealth-to-income ratios have held up. But house prices are softening and households appear to be circumspect in their spending patterns. Maybe if some of the Brexit-related uncertainty were to dissipate, things might improve, but I suspect that consumers will not be doing any cartwheels in 2019. Noble Francis, economics director, Construction Products Association
 Real wages are finally rising but only at 1 per cent and real wages remain lower than 10 years ago. Real wages fell throughout 2017 and households continue to suffer the lagged impacts of this. In 2018 Q3, households spent more than they earned for the eighth quarter in a row. What happens to households at the end of 2019 will be highly dependent upon the unemployment rate remaining historically low to ensure nominal wage growth and, just as importantly, what happens to inflation. In turn, these will be both be dependent on the type of Brexit we have.  Assuming a deal is agreed and passes through parliament, then we would expect the unemployment rate to remain at historic lows and for nominal wage growth of around 3.5 per cent. Assuming a deal, CPI inflation would still be expected to remain above the Bank of England’s target of 2.0 per cent and average 2.4 per cent due to a rise in energy prices after OPEC’s decision to cut production to push up oil prices. Overall, around 1 per cent growth in real wages and households feeling slightly better off. However, a no-deal scenario would be expected to lead to a significant rise in both unemployment and inflation, the latter due to a depreciation in sterling raising import prices, pushing down nominal wage growth and leading to falls in real wages, making households worse off. Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, LSE
 Depending on the Brexit outcome, exchange rates may be very volatile, declining sharply on a no-deal outcome, but equally rising if we end up in Remain. In a small open economy, such as the UK, the movements in prices resulting from the Brexit exchange rate impact will dominate the effect of the increase in nominal wages. So, whether people will feel better or worse will depend largely on Brexit. Andy Goodwin, associate director, Oxford Economics
 We expect CPI inflation to drop back to around 1.5 per cent in H2 2019. And though we expect the recent acceleration in wage growth to peter out, we should see real wage growth of 1-1.5 per cent in 2019. While still some way short of pre-financial crisis norms, this should mean that many households feel better off by the end of next year. But it shouldn’t be forgotten that those households which rely on working age state benefits will endure another cash-terms freeze next year. Though real income growth should be stronger in 2019, we are sceptical that we will see faster consumer spending growth. This is due to the extent to which spending growth has been fuelled by credit over the past couple of years — we think that both the ability and desire of consumers to borrow is waning, so spending and income are likely to be more closely aligned moving forward. Mark Gregory, chief economist, EY
 Much depends on Brexit — an exit that is viewed negatively by the markets will hit the pound and drive up inflation, which will squeeze real incomes and corporate margins so limiting any pay rises. In this scenario, households will not feel better off, quite the opposite. With a more benign Brexit, there will be slightly more positive news for households but the middle of the distribution will continue to be squeezed as employers start to look to reduce their labour intensity, especially in sectors such as retail and logistics. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics
 Households should have more money at their disposal next year. Wage growth appears to be finally embarking on a sustained recovery, reflecting the fact that there is very little spare capacity left in the labour market. The fading impact of sterling’s post-referendum drop and the recent fall in oil prices should push inflation back to the 2 per cent target by the end of this year. Meanwhile, solid employment growth should continue to support households’ real incomes. However, a no-deal Brexit could knock 1 to 3 percentage points off consumer spending growth next year. Sentiment would be hit and a drop in the pound and tariffs on EU imports would put renewed pressure on inflation. Meanwhile, any acceleration in pay growth could be kept in check by the impact of weaker activity on unemployment. Rebecca Harding, chief executive, Coriolis Technologies
 It is unlikely that households will feel significantly better off by the end of 2019. This is because feeling better off is not just a function of real wages. Based on ONS data, the average household spends £554.21 a month. A simple back-of-the envelope calculation aggregates this to a net annual income of £28,828 per year or a gross income of around £37,000 at current rates of tax, national insurance and pension contributions. While this is not a precise number, it serves to make a point. Average annual salaries are, gross, £27,000. The gap between what households spend and what they receive in income is too broad to bridge with modestly rising real wages. Whether 2019 is dominated by uncertainty or by a no-deal and disorderly Brexit, the fact is that the current political gridlock is a material downside risk to demand and investment that will outweigh the effects of rising wages and potentially widen the gap between spending and income. John Hawksworth, chief economist, PwC
 If there is a reasonably smooth Brexit, then we would expect moderate but positive real household disposable income growth in 2019, due both to higher real wages and to the effective income tax cuts due from April because of increased personal allowances and thresholds. But if there is a disorderly Brexit, any such positive effects would be likely to be offset by a probable rise in unemployment and a squeeze on real incomes from a likely large fall in the pound, pushing up import prices. Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist, Société Générale
 Yes, but only if a Brexit deal is done. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist, BNP Paribas
 The worst for the UK consumer has probably now passed, so long as a no-deal Brexit is avoided. A pick-up in real wages has been a long-held expectation of many economists, but it is finally happening. We think this trend should continue as the tight labour market delivers a further pick-up in wages, whilst inflation drifts lower, reflecting the fall in oil prices at the end of 2018. Of course, whether households “feel” better off depends on numerous other factors as well, such as the state of the housing market, which remains very weak, and the outlook for the economy, on which consumers remain very pessimistic. Ethan Ilzetzki, lecturer, LSE
 UK labour markets are tight and real wages will probably continue increasing in 2019. Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist, BCA Research
 Yes, households will feel better off at the end of 2019, but only if the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit! The reason is that following the recent collapse in the oil price, inflation is going to plunge in the first half of 2019. And this is set to boost real wages even further. Stephen King, senior economic adviser, HSBC
 It depends partly on what happens to sterling — and sterling’s future rests partly with Brexit. In the event of a soft Brexit — or, indeed, a second referendum that reversed the original decision — sterling would likely appreciate, driving headline inflation lower with a positive effect on real wages. In a hard Brexit scenario, sterling would likely fall — possibly a long way — pushing inflation higher and thus threatening real wages. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist, Joseph Rowntree Foundation
 Yes average wages are finally rising in real terms, but household incomes will show a mixed picture. Those on the minimum wage will see decent increases in pre-tax earnings. However, many lower earners will continue to have to cope with fake self-employment and other forms of casualisation that put downward pressure on wages. Meanwhile, families on low incomes — both in and out of work — will still face the benefit freeze. On top of that, the impact of the two-child limit for benefits and tax credits will gradually increase, meaning that household incomes at the bottom will not share equally in improvements. Ruth Lea, economic adviser, Arbuthnot Banking Group
 Average earnings in real terms have been picking up slowly for much of this year (2018), after falling back in 2017, reaching annual growth of around 1 per cent in the 3 months to October 2018. If this continues through 2019, which is quite possible given the tight state of the labour market, then households, as a block, should feel a tad better off by end-2019. I do, however, doubt whether such modest real terms increases will have much impact on households’ “wellbeing”. This analysis assumes that the pound does not depreciate significantly after Brexit and inflation stays relatively subdued in 2019, thus enabling real terms earnings growth to continue. Inevitably, some households will fare better than others. Indeed, according to the ONS, those in “continuous employment” have tended to experience higher real earnings growth since the Great Recession than the crude aggregate series suggests. One problem with the aggregate data are that their average is affected by compositional changes in employment. Higher-than-average growth in entry-level, low-paid jobs inevitably drags average earnings down — and hence drags down the growth in the average earnings. John Llewellyn, Llewellyn Consulting
 Again, that depends entirely on what happens re Brexit. Sterling will have a lot to do with it. A crash out and sterling will plummet, sharply reducing real incomes. A decision to remain would have the opposite effects. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist, Netwealth
 They probably will feel much as they do now, although at least the uncertainty over Brexit should have been lifted. I expect inflation to remain low, and thus there should be real wage growth, which should underpin confidence. Although the solid UK labour market and rising wage growth could underpin consumption, household spending may be soft in the early months of the year, with a near-term rise in savings. House prices may stagnate during 2019, and thus have a neutral impact on confidence, as they will still be expensive for those looking to buy.  Stephen Machin, professor, LSE
 Real wages are up a bit, but this is very modest and nowhere near what was the norm before the financial crisis. Nominal wages have grown a little bit more and price inflation has started to drop a bit, but it needs to be stressed that real wage growth is still very weedy and therefore so is growth in living standards in real terms. Some groups are continuing to lose out a lot, especially those young people who do not have the Bank of Mum and Dad to bail them out and help get them on the housing ladder (as a consequence of the gains their parents achieved due to the big inequality increases of the 1980s and to a lesser extent the 1990s and early 2000s). There are big social mobility concerns for the future being stored up because of this. Chris Martin, professor of economics, Bath university
 If the UK enters a transition with the EU or remains, households may be [about] 1 per cent better off; but they probably will not feel it. If UK does not enter a transition, households will be up to 3 per cent worse off. To them, it will probably feel even worse than that. Costas Milas, professor of finance, University of Liverpool
 Unfortunately, all depends on Brexit-related uncertainty. Inflation will catch up with and even overtake nominal wage growth if a no-deal Brexit occurs. If, on the other hand, Mrs May and her government wrap up the whole Brexit-related saga quickly, I am fairly confident that a “Brexit dividend” effect will boost the earnings of workers, making them feel better off by the end of 2019. David Miles, professor, Imperial College
 A rise in real wages of, say, 1 to 2 per cent is hardly noticeable to most households. Allan Monks, UK economist, JPMorgan
 We expect household real labour income growth to average 2.6 per cent in 2019, as the combination of lower inflation, strengthening wage growth and continued job growth benefits incomes. The question is whether Brexit uncertainty will initially cause households to save rather than spend these income gains. Andrew Mountford, professor, Royal Holloway
 Over the short term, uncertainty over job security (not only from Brexit but a possible global recession) will dampen the benefit of real wage growth and so I wouldn’t expect a large increase in household spending to follow on from any real wage growth. It is important to realise that technological progress will still continue. Brexit doesn’t stop this happening, it just means that the UK will benefit less than it otherwise would have done — average growth will be 1.5 per cent instead of 2 per cent, an effect which will only become clear as it cumulates (such a difference in growth rates implies the UK will be 15 per cent less better off than it would have been after a couple for decades, ie something that will slowly become noticeable). Jacob Nell, chief UK economist, Morgan Stanley
 We are bullish on pay growth, given the tight labour market, and expect it to rise to above 3.5 per cent in H2 2019. With inflation holding around the 2 per cent target, this implies positive real pay growth throughout our forecast horizon — so households should feel better off. However, consumer spending will grow more slowly next year we think, since we also see a pick-up in savings, with another jump in pension contributions under auto-enrolment in April 2019, and weaker growth in borrowing. In aggregate, this implies household spending in line with real income growth, rather than running above it. We therefore forecast that consumption growth will weaken modestly over 2019 as a whole, although we expect the low point for consumption will be in 1Q-19 and anticipate a modest recovery in household spending from 2Q-19 onwards, once the UK is firmly on the path to a soft Brexit. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist, CBI
 Unless we have a no-deal Brexit, households should finally see some respite in living standards over course of next year. Inflation is likely to continue falling gradually as the impact of the post-referendum fall in the pound continues to fade. A tight labour market will also push wage growth higher, so that real earnings will stretch that little bit further. Households will feel a bit better off, not a step change. However, we expect productivity growth to remain continually weak, which will hold back any acceleration in wage growth and continue to cast a long shadow over living standards. But if we have a no-deal Brexit, households will really feel the pinch. We’d likely see much higher inflation on the drop of weaker sterling, and a significant squeeze again on incomes. Coupled with rising unemployment, it would be a really tough year for business and households alike. Charles Nolan, professor, Glasgow university
 Not much, if at all. Productivity growth needs to be more widespread and more robust . . . and Brexit, blah-blah! Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science, Warwick university
 Apart from background uncertainties caused by Brexit, it seems likely that they will. But a hard Brexit’s consequences are not forecastable in any precise way. We haven’t practised this as a country. David Owen, managing director and chief European economist, Jefferies
 As in much of Europe and the US, the Phillips curve is kicking in with wages accelerating, so yes many households may see the benefit of higher real earnings. However, 2019 will be a year of heightened uncertainty. House prices may continue to adjust relative to incomes, and there will be a focus on raising longer-term savings. In a hard Brexit scenario a lot of people could end 2019 feeling significantly worse off. Tej Parikh, senior economist, Institute of Directors
 With wages slowly rising and inflation trending down toward the 2 per cent target, households will experience a boost to their wallets in 2019. That said, significant growth in pay packets will remain limited by high business costs and ongoing productivity challenges. Ann Pettifor, director, Policy Research in Macroeconomics 
 No, the rise in real wages to date is marginal and average real wages are still below their level ten years ago. Even if Brexit avoids a cliff edge, the UK’s future will remain uncertain with the transition, if there is one, due to expire in 2020, weakening consumer confidence. John Philpott, The Jobs Economist
 Once again, Brexit uncertainty makes it difficult to provide an answer. Assuming we avoid no deal, the labour market should provide a boost to household incomes with employment remaining high and annual nominal wage growth of around 3 per cent. What happens to real incomes will then in turn depend on whether consumer price inflation returns to target without need for a further rise in Bank of England rates. The key factor here is growth in labour productivity and there is little evidence to suggest a breakthrough improvement in 2019. The best that households can hope for in 2019 is thus another year of modest gains, even if life continues to feel like a constant financial struggle. Kallum Pickering, senior economist, Berenberg
 Yes, so long as a hard Brexit is avoided. Mismatched labour demand and labour supply will continue to widen in 2019. Real wage growth is likely to accelerate to about 1.5 per cent as nominal wage growth rises above 3.5 per cent and headline inflation trends towards 2 per cent by H2 2019. Christopher Pissarides, professor, LSE
 They might end up with a more healthy bank balance but Brexit-related uncertainty and the necessary re-adjustment — such as taking longer to cross the channel or take a flight to an EU country, not finding as easily the European goods they are accustomed to buying, some higher prices as a result of excess administrative burdens on firms, a depreciated pound, etc — will take away any gloss. Altogether they will feel worse off, even if there is more money in the bank. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy, King’s College, London
 Since the Brexit referendum, real wages have risen by just over 1 per cent; in the two years before the referendum they rose by about 3.5 per cent. From the 1950s to 2008, they typically rose 1.5 per cent or so annually. So by any standards, real wage growth remains anaemic, particularly given low unemployment. Given Brexit uncertainties, as well as the slowing global outlook, I wouldn’t expect real wage growth to be particularly impressive by historical standards any time soon. Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser, Centre for Economics and Business Research
 Wages are rising above inflation after many quarters of falling behind when prices shot up due to the fall in the exchange rate after the referendum vote. Inflation has now eased and that should in theory make consumers more willing to spend. But wages are only growing by some 1 per cent in real terms and recent surveys show a sharp fall in consumer confidence despite record employment levels. We are seeing that reflected in relatively poor retail sales and a service sector where activity in general is now more or less flat. Consumers had been encouraged to borrow on the back of record-low interest rates and the huge injection of liquidity as the Bank of England intervened to ensure funding was still available after the referendum vote. However, the new path to higher interest rates and the fall in house price growth are affecting consumers’ willingness to get even more deeply into debt. Many jobs remain insecure and relatively poorly paid and the continued welfare cuts are not likely to help much. It is therefore questionable whether one should really count on the consumer to be particularly supporting growth in 2019. Sonali Punhani, UK economist, Credit Suisse
 The outlook for household consumption depends on whether these real wage gains are sustained (which depends on the path of Brexit negotiations) and behaviour of consumers. After responding to a real income shock after the 2016 referendum by lowering their savings rate, consumers could start to save rising real income growth instead of spending it. We suspect some of that might already be happening. Ricardo Reis, LSE
 It depends on how Brexit turns out. See the previous answers. Philip Rush, founder and chief economist, Heteronomics
 Real wage growth should gather a little extra pace in 2019, and that is likely to be spent. Such growth is never evenly spread, though, and the disgruntled are much louder than the modestly content, so I wouldn’t expect a cheery consumer to be part of the narrative even if it is in the data. Yael Selfin, chief economist, KPMG
 Assuming no major fall in sterling as a result of a difficult Brexit and a subsequent rise in inflation, consumers will enjoy a longer spell of rising real wages by the end of 2019 which, coupled with rising vacancies numbers, should make them feel financially more secure. A more fragile housing market and a volatile equity market may offset some of that. Philip Shaw, chief economist, Investec
 Yes. We are not convinced that pay growth will go through the roof, but tight labour markets are beginning to result in firmer wage trends in a number of developed economies. A pace of earnings growth close to 3.5 per cent seems perfectly realistic, while inflation may drift below the 2 per cent target towards the end of the year if sterling recovers, as we expect. Andrew Simms, co-director, New Weather Institute
 The latest quarterly figures actually show real wages looking fairly stagnant, while households run down savings and rack up debt to maintain spending. Given the broader economic impacts of prevailing uncertainty, it is hard to imagine households feeling better off by the end of 2019. We need to remember also the ongoing, if increasingly overlooked, impact on local realities of government spending measures set under the shadow of self-imposed austerity. Even if real wages had continued to rise, loss of services and the divisive politics of Brexit, not to mention the long shadow of the “hostile environment” policy, are likely to wipeout any minor potential feel-good factors. In terms of the reduced availability and quality of a wide range of services — from libraries, to youth, care and sports’ services — that help determine how households “feel”, these effects are real, attritional and corrosive. Nina Skero, director and head of macroeconomics, CEBR
 It is unlikely that 2019 will be a good year for households despite the pick-up in wage growth. CEBR expects the pound to weaken further throughout the year, pushing up inflation and eating away some of the wage gains. CEBR’s work with retailers and debt charities has convinced us that debt anxiety is likely to be an important factor conditioning consumer spending in 2019. Andrew Smithers, author
 No. The trend growth rate of the UK economy is only around 1 per cent per annum. Gary Styles, director, GPS Economics
 I expect households will at best only feel slightly better off. The balance of risks is that inflation will surprise on the upside. Suren Thiru, head of economics and business finance, British Chambers of Commerce
 Real wage growth is likely remain relatively subdued in 2019 as sluggish productivity, high upfront costs for businesses and Brexit uncertainty combine to limit pay settlements. While average earnings growth will continue to outstrip inflation, the gap between pay and price growth is likely to be insufficient to drive material improvement in household finances, particularly given current debt levels. Phil Thornton, director, Clarity Economics
 Households are unlikely to “feel” better off — but that is because of the impact of Brexit. If the question is whether they “will” be better off, then it is a mixed picture. If real wages (wage growth minus inflation) continues to rise then the employed on average will have more money in their pocket. The chancellor talked about ending austerity and to some extent that will be borne out. The increases to the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold will benefit those at the middle to higher end of the wage ladder but not those at the bottom. Changes to universal credit (improvements to allowances for children and disabled family members and the rate for deductions) will leave poorer households less worse off. But government grant funding for local services delivered by local councils will be cut by £1.3bn (36 per cent) in 2019/20, which will directly impact the less well off. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics
 We expect year-over-year growth in nominal wages to stabilise at about 3 per cent, rather than carry on rising. Although unemployment is very low, employers still can draw on under-utilised self-employed and part-time workers to fill positions. In addition, labour supply will be boosted in 2019 by increases in the state pension age. The fall in inflation over the past year will bear down on pay settlements, while NHS workers will receive a smaller rise than in 2018. Nonetheless, the outlook for below-target inflation throughout 2019 suggests that real wages will rise by about 1.2 per cent in 2019, the biggest increase since 2016. Meanwhile, substantial increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold for income tax will boost disposable incomes in April. Kitty Ussher, economist and former Treasury minister
 On average, yes. People employed by firms exporting to the EU, however, may feel less secure depending on what parliament decides. John Van Reenen, professor, MIT economics department and Sloan management school
 The increases in real wages remain small. The performance of pay in the UK has been atrocious since the financial crisis, the worst since at least the Great Depression. Poor productivity growth is at the root of this and Brexit will make this worse. Populist anger has festered due to this. In retrospect, it is now clear that the premature excessive austerity (particularly 2010-12) is part of the reason for our current economic and political malaise. So unless there is a new vote to Remain, households will feel worse off at the end of 2019. Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist, TS Lombard
 The “flow” (real incomes) has improved but the “stock” (household finances) is vulnerable, keeping consumer confidence down and saving intentions elevated against a backdrop of heightened political uncertainty. At this juncture, the scope for further acceleration in wage growth looks limited. The surveys point to employment intentions losing steam and the level of settlements (about 2.5 per cent year-on-year) is somewhat low, so a period of consolidation around 3 per cent is likely. Annual real growth in households’ broad money balances continues to flatline around zero, evidence that the tailwind to spending from faster earnings growth is muted by the inevitable slowdown in job creation, weaker consumer credit expansion and a negative wealth effect from the cooling property market. Daniel Vernazza, chief UK and senior global economist, UniCredit
 Probably not, even if Brexit is orderly, for several reasons. First, ultimately Brexit is likely to lead to a less open, and hence less productive, UK economy. This will require a downward adjustment of real incomes to the new, lower potential growth. Also, heightened uncertainty is likely to persist as negotiations on a future trade deal begin in earnest. Second, the global economy is likely to be less supportive in 2019 than it was in 2018 due to trade tensions, tighter global financial conditions, heightened macro uncertainty, a fading US fiscal stimulus, and an ongoing slowdown in China. The main source of relief for UK households in the short term will be the large fall in oil prices, while an orderly exit from the EU is likely to lead to an appreciation of sterling and an easing of inflationary pressure next year, but it’s unlikely to be enough to offset the forces mentioned above for the development of real incomes. Keith Wade, chief economist, Schroders
 Yes, although this could be tempered by weakness in the housing market, which has begun to correct. Martin Weale, professor, King’s College
 Yes. The high demand for labour means that wages are likely to remain buoyant. Wage growth may well accelerate to 4 per cent per annum by the end of the year. I have been saying that for a long time and it may turn out to be true eventually. Simon Wells, chief European economist, HSBC
 Real incomes should rise modestly but people are unlikely to “feel” much better. Savings rates are very low, the housing market is weak and financial conditions have tightened a bit. A rapid rise in consumer confidence seems unlikely. Peter Westaway, chief economist, Vanguard Asset Management
 With sterling more likely to rally on the back of a Brexit deal or the reversal of Brexit, real incomes should be boosted by falling import prices, an effect magnified by the impact of lower oil prices feeding through into consumer prices. As a result, UK consumers should start to feel better off as 2019 progresses. If productivity begins to recover too, the dog that so far hasn’t barked, then income growth should be stronger still. Matthew Whittaker, deputy director, Resolution Foundation
 Yes. Short of a disruptive no deal Brexit, we can expect wage growth to be sustained through 2019. With employment at a record high, we might also hope for a more generalised improvement in job quality. However, there may be distinct differences across the earnings distribution. Average wage growth has been supported in the past two years by large increases in the wage floor, and we can expect to see that again in 2019. But the average has also been boosted by the re-emergence of strong wage growth at the very top of the distribution. If that pattern persists into 2019, then the headline rate will overstate the lived experience for the majority in the middle of the earnings distribution. Moving from earnings to wider incomes, lower income households must endure the final year of the four-year benefits freeze, implying that income inequality is likely to rise again in 2019. The continued — slow — transition to universal credit will create new difficulties for some too, reflecting the fact that the “simple” system too often fails to meet the variable needs of users’ real lives. Mike Wickens, professor, University of York
 No. The rise in wages is due to shortages of labour because of the effects of lower immigration. This mainly affects low-productivity jobs. A sustained higher level of real wages requires higher productivity — which results from higher capital/labour ratios that require higher investment. See my response to the first question. Trevor Williams, visiting professor, University of Derby
 No. Wage inflation cannot continue to rise as firms’ profit margins will be increasingly squeezed by higher labour costs, high materials costs as the currency slides and by uncertainty about demand. As the year wears on, wage growth will slow sharply back to the 2 per cent annual rate we have seen on average over the past five years. Money supply growth is slowing and suggests squeezed budgets for business and households. Alastair Winter, chief economist, Daniel Stewart & Company
 Yes! Once Brexit is sorted via Mrs May’s deal or straight remaining, consumer confidence will start returning. With inflation staying around 2 per cent thanks to flat oil prices and wages running at around 3 per cent, people will feel better off, especially in the public sector. Unemployment is unlikely to change much even if EU workers decide to stay in the UK after all. Garry Young, NIESR
 Hardly. Real wages are rising at a rate of about 1 per cent a year. That is welcome but it will take many years before people feel much better off. Linda Yueh, adjunct professor of economics, London Business School
 That will depend on wages continuing to rise. And that in turn will depend on productivity improving so that wage rises can be sustained as well as how well employers are prepared for a downturn in the business cycle. In other words, most US CFOs are expecting America to be in recession in 2019 or 2020 after growth peaked around mid-2018. The UK tends to fall within a similar business cycle as the US. So, it’s likely that the economy will be slowing in 2019. Coupled with the productivity challenge, wage growth may not grow very well towards the end of the year and will affect how households feel at the end of 2019. Azad Zangana, senior economist, Schroders
 Households should feel better as wages in real terms continue to accelerate. Employment growth is, however, forecast to slow as the economy reaches full employment. Consumption should improve in 2019, but not by much. This is because households have run down their savings rate to be able maintain spending patterns in 2018. The improvement in disposable income is expected to boost savings and pay down debt more than increase spending. Name withheld
 Most likely not. The slowdown from Brexit will take any optimism out. How far will the government act in 2019 on its promise to end austerity? Howard Archer, chief economic adviser, EY ITEM Club
 Not very far. The chancellor has indicated that next year’s spending review will see annual average spending growth of 1.2 per cent in real terms. Mr. Hammond implied this could be just a taster of things to come, indicating that spending could rise more if a “Brexit dividend” comes from a smooth UK exit from the EU in March, which allows him to use up some of the £15.4bn fiscal buffer he has put aside and causes the OBR to raise its growth forecasts We doubt that the chancellor will get much, if any, of a Brexit dividend in terms of growth forecast upgrades. And if he sticks to his current fiscal rules, his room for manoeuvre has been limited by the Office for National Statistics announcing that it will some time next year change its treatment of student loans in the public finances, which will add about £12bn to the budget deficit. On the face of it, this would wipe out the bulk of the £15.4bn headroom that the chancellor has against the fiscal mandate. Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics, LSE
 The government is very likely to fail to meet its fiscal targets because of costs associated with Brexit, eg preparation for no deal; and because lower growth will adversely affect tax revenues. Ray Barrell, professor, Brunel university
 Austerity will be much modified in the next few years. Austerity involved reducing the scale of government in the economy as well as reducing the budget deficit. Reducing the size of government has done a great deal of damage and the process can be stopped only with higher taxes or higher borrowing. Marian Bell, Alpha Economics
 A continued easing of fiscal policy may be necessitated by the Brexit-related negative economic impact this year. However, the implications for the UK economy of a hard Brexit will be to make the economy smaller and less able to fund public services in the long term. Neil Blake, global head of forecasting, CBRE
 Not as far as the bluster in the Budget speech implied. A Brexit hit to growth will hit the tax take and reverse the benefit from last year’s windfall. Danny Blanchflower, professor, Dartmouth College
 Unclear what they will do. Austerity has failed disastrously, generating the slowest recovery in 300 years, so it is about time as the next recession approaches. I have little faith that Hammond has any clue what to do in the face of a slowing economy. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy, Imperial College
 It will make some eye-catching changes for political effect, but total spend will be held constant at best. We will move into a new, much longer-term instalment of austerity as tax revenues are projected to fall, especially stamp duty on housing and high-rate tax payments by financial services staff. George Buckley, Nomura
 With the government having delivered a sizeable fiscal boost in the shape of additional NHS spending, we doubt that the chancellor will do much to alter his current plan to slowly reduce the deficit over time. That could change, depending on the nature of Brexit — a difficult departure could require fiscal stimulus on the one hand, but on the other makes it less affordable thanks to the impact that a Brexit-induced recession could have on the public finances. Base case: continued modest austerity with a pre-election boost in the early 2020s. Sarah Carlson, Moody’s Investors Service
 The chancellor’s 2019/20 Budget set out the largest discretionary fiscal loosening since 2010, and we think that he is likely to deliver a real increase in expenditures after next year’s spending review is concluded. However, the government’s decision to spend, rather than save, the better than expected fiscal results of the past year means that the UK sovereign has less ability to absorb a negative shock without having to increase debt. Jagjit Chadha, NIESR
 Total managed expenditure is now below its long-run level and there are areas of the public sector in need of investment: public infrastructure, education, health and transport. So it might be quite hard to rein in public expenditure further. The better way to limit the increase in public debt would be to consider a fundamental review of the tax system alongside the spending review pencilled in for next year. There are two aspects of fiscal policy, and insufficient attention has been given to reform of tax and revenue-raising rather than constraints on expenditure. One side point on the fiscal rule, if I may: the self-imposed rules have been regularly modified and I question whether they ought to be treated as a binding constraint or more as a target to be followed flexibly, as has been the case with the monetary policy rule for inflation. In recent institute work, we have shown that expenditure plans are regularly revised but may not reflect the correct response to the requirements of society in terms of current or capital expenditure. The targeted deficits, though proving some support to credibility, are not necessarily socially optimal. David Cobham, professor, Heriot-Watt University
 Very little. There is no sign that senior Tory politicians recognise that austerity has been a mistake (undertaken for essentially ideological reasons), and the economy will be weak enough to provide the justification for further postponement (at best). Brian Coulton, chief economist, Fitch Ratings
 Our latest forecasts for UK growth in 2019 — which for the purposes of our forecasts assume a smooth Brexit transition and avoidance of a cliff edge — incorporated a significant discretionary easing in fiscal policy, as announced in the autumn Budget. On that basis we made a minor upward revision to our baseline growth outlook. But of course with Brexit, the risks are skewed to the downside. Diane Coyle, Bennett professor of public policy, University of Cambridge
 It depends how bad the Brexit impact is, but in any case it will fall on those with least ability to weather it, and who have been worst affected by the significant shrinkage in public services. If things turn out as badly as I fear, I don’t think austerity will be politically sustainable. Bronwyn Curtis, independent economist
 Do we believe the government’s announcement in the October Budget that austerity is over? Tax revenues are unlikely to be higher going forward as some of the largest businesses and higher rate taxpayers have taken steps to limit their exposure to Brexit and moved assets abroad and there are now global headwinds to deal with.  The chancellor will have little wriggle room, but the political uncertainties will tip the balance towards loosening fiscal policy in 2019 even if there is “no Brexit”. The closer we are to a “no-deal Brexit”, the stronger the fiscal policy response will be.  Howard Davies, chairman, RBS
 The government is not strong enough now to resist pressure to oil squeaky wheels. They are found across Whitehall: in the Ministry of Defence, in the Department for Transport, and especially the Department for Work and Pensions, where universal credit will cost far more to implement. If you add preparations for a no-deal Brexit, there will be an involuntary fiscal easing, driven by decibel planning rather than a considered view of where the shoe is pinching. Panicos Demetriades, professor of financial economics, University of Leicester
 This promise is optics, if not also cheap talk by a government with a short horizon. If somehow the government survives, the only way there will be an end to austerity is if in a people’s vote the UK votes to remain in the EU. The value of the pound will increase significantly in that scenario and the economy will revert to healthy growth rates. The UK will once again become more attractive to foreign investors and with healthier public finances, the government will be able to invest more in health and education. Wouter den Haan, professor, LSE
 Given the Brexit chaos, the government may very well be forced to implement an expansionary fiscal policy either because the potential of Brexit-related chaos will require immediate government spending or because voters’ dismay will induce political pressures to do so. Swati Dhingra, LSE
 It depends on the aftermath of the Brexit negotiations. If a slowdown happens quickly, it will put pressure on public finances, though the government does have room to end austerity. For example, borrowing costs have not been hit yet. The government is more likely to end austerity closer to an election. Peter Dixon, economist, Commerzbank
 While the government has committed to additional spending, a large chunk of it is destined for the NHS which, while a positive, does nothing for the other government departments that have been starved of funds for many years. The police and fire services, prisons and local authorities are not going to see an end to austerity. Moreover, although over the past eight years local authorities have been able to offset part of the 40 per cent reduction in centrally disbursed incomes through a rise in locally retained sources, local authority revenues are down 22 per cent in real terms — the sort of squeeze that people tend to notice in their day-to-day environment. With pre-announced welfare cuts yet to feed into the system, the end of austerity is not yet upon us. Most people are unlikely to notice much change in 2019 and we will need greater efforts from government before they are persuaded that change is happening.  Noble Francis, economics director, Construction Products Association
 The UK government has a tendency to make major announcements but the reality on the ground rarely matches the announcements, particularly for the construction industry. Local authorities will remain financially constrained in the short term and medium term. There may well be some areas such as the NHS that experience increases in funding but an end to austerity is merely likely to mean that, at best, after eight years of austerity across central government and local government the cuts come to an end. It doesn’t mean that public sector spending will return to higher levels. Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, LSE
 Political pressures will ensure that fiscal policy becomes modestly expansionary, irrespective of what else happens. Andy Goodwin, associate director, Oxford Economics
 Unless Brexit is disorderly, I would not expect to see a further loosening of the fiscal stance. The upcoming changes to the treatment of student loans are likely to wipe out a large chunk of the margin for error against the fiscal mandate, which will constrain the chancellor unless the public finances continue to improve faster than the OBR anticipates. Having said that, there is a reasonable chance that the chancellor will decide that it is time to update his fiscal rules. Because the fiscal mandate is judged with reference to a fixed date (2020-21), the horizon has become very short and it makes little sense as a benchmark for setting policy. The chancellor could move the reference date further out, which could also give him some extra flexibility around policy. Mark Gregory, chief economist, EY
 Cautiously, while the Brexit process remains ongoing and even when we have a clear way forward, I don’t expect much stimulus beyond what has already been announced. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics
 Unless the UK leaves the EU in March without a deal, the fiscal picture for 2019 (and beyond) is likely to be considerably brighter than the Office for Budget Responsibility expects. It is possible that Mr Hammond (or whoever is the chancellor by then) may be able to both loosen the purse strings and meet the manifesto pledge to eliminate the budget deficit by the mid-2020s. If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, we think that the chancellor would sacrifice his fiscal rules if necessary in order to loosen fiscal policy. A giveaway of £20bn or so, or 1 per cent of GDP, would probably be enough to roughly offset the hit to GDP that we expect in the immediate aftermath of a “no deal” Brexit. Meanwhile, the advent of a Labour government would probably lead to slightly higher public sector borrowing than under the Conservatives’ plans. While this could result in a small fiscal boost, the benefits would probably be offset by the dent to private sector investment from Labour’s anti-business policies. Rebecca Harding, chief executive, Coriolis Technologies
 The government’s hands are tied in terms of its promise to end austerity. It has already committed £2bn to planning for a no-deal Brexit and Philip Hammond himself suggested in his autumn Budget that he would have to reverse the £30bn spending plans he laid out in the event of a disorderly no-deal exit from the EU on March 29. Unless the chancellor is willing to use his war chest to create a substantial fiscal boost to manage any severe downturn, the financial pressures of Brexit and the burgeoning problems for housing, the NHS and universal credit will continue to take a back seat.  John Hawksworth, chief economist, PwC
 If there is a reasonably smooth Brexit, we would expect the government to proceed broadly on the lines outlined in the autumn 2018 Budget. This implies a significant easing of austerity over the next four to five years, but not a complete end to austerity in relation to welfare benefits and unprotected areas (ie other than health, overseas aid, defence and security). We don’t see much extra room for manoeuvre for the chancellor in 2019 even in this favourable Brexit scenario, bearing in mind also the significant reduction in the headroom available in meeting his 2020 fiscal target due to forthcoming (very sensible) changes in the way in which student loans are accounted for in the public finances. The chancellor could respond to this by relaxing his fiscal target, given this was based on previous accounting rules, but there could be costs to this in terms of the perceived credibility of fiscal policy. If there is a disorderly Brexit, we would expect significant short-term fiscal loosening to mitigate the economic pain. In the longer term, however, the budget deficit would be significantly higher in such a scenario and austerity would probably have to be resumed some years down the line to address this. Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist, Société Générale
 It will stick to its autumn Budget plans but that will not feel like the end of austerity for areas other than the NHS because they will see no real increase in spending when they need increases to reverse some of the damage done by years of ringfencing spending. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist, BNP Paribas
 Fiscal policy will provide support to growth in 2019, but it would be hard to conclude that the government will put an end to austerity this year — unless Chancellor Hammond decides to scrap his fiscal rules. Ethan Ilzetzki, lecturer, LSE
 I am less optimistic relative to official projections on UK (and global) economic growth in 2019. I therefore expect that deficits will be larger than currently forecast. It is more difficult to forecast how the exchequer will react to such a shortfall. Political uncertainty is even higher than economic uncertainty. I am even uncertain whether the current parliament will be in place through December 2019. Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist, BCA Research
 The end to austerity in the UK is highly conditional on the UK avoiding a no-deal Brexit, for two reasons: a no-deal Brexit would almost certainly hurt the health of government finances; also, a no-deal Brexit would demand the entire focus and energy of the government, leaving little scope for other policy initiatives. Stephen King, HSBC
 In health, a bit. Everywhere else, not much at all. There might be big corporation tax cuts in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist, Joseph Rowntree Foundation
 In the short term, improving average real wages will reduce fiscal pressure but the elephant in the room is Brexit. A distant trading relationship with the EU will have negative economic consequences and increase fiscal pressure. It may be that the risk of such an eventuality constrains the government’s freedom to relax the purse strings to the extent that shorter-term trends allow.  However, this government will remain under political pressure as Brexit uncertainty continues. This will create more pressure for expenditure to alleviate some of the more severe consequences of previous policies. On balance, I think the political factors will dominate and so we may see some increased expenditure in areas where pressure is greatest. Ruth Lea, economic adviser, Arbuthnot Banking Group
 It all depends what is meant by austerity — a nebulous concept. If overall public spending levels are considered, it is not necessarily obvious that there has been any “austerity” at all since 2010, such was the rapid growth in public spending during the 2000s, well outstripping GDP growth. The public spending/GDP ratio was around 34 to 35 per cent in the early 2000s, rising to more than 44 per cent in 2009 to 2010, before falling back to about 38 per cent at present (around the ratio of the mid-2000s). On this metric, what has happened to public expenditure since 2010 can be seen as a long-overdue correction to spending after the “profligacy” of the 2000s. After all, public spending has to be paid for — by the taxpayer. Granted since 2010, some budgets have fared much better than others. For example, the “ringfenced” programmes (including health) have fared much better than non-ringfenced. Undoubtedly, some programmes (defence, public order, education) have experienced real terms cuts in their budgets since 2010, though, on the whole, even they have larger budgets (in real terms) than they did 20 years ago.  However, the “austerity” narrative seems to have become the “norm” and the government clearly feels the political need to be seen to be “ending austerity”. Again, it is not clear how exactly this is to be defined. One approach is to “make good” the real terms cuts experienced in the non-ringfenced public sector budgets since 2010. But this is just one approach, taking an arbitrary starting point. The next step will be, of course, the 2019 spending review (date unknown) when the government will announce its plans to 2023-24. Assuming the current chancellor stays in position, I would expect a fairly hawkish settlement (except for the already announced NHS spending). If this is the case, many of those calling for an “end to austerity” will doubtless be disappointed. Whereas those of us, who question much of the “austerity” narrative, will doubtless feel that “ending” anything as nebulous as “austerity” is an unwinnable political hostage to fortune. John Llewellyn, Llewellyn Consulting
 That depends on the economics and the politics. The NHS, the police and the defence forces have all been starved for a decade. Social and political pressures to reverse some of this are mounting. But the fiscal headroom will be limited by the nature of the Brexit outcome. Either way, any UK government is going to face enormous pressures over the next 20 years. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist, Netwealth
 The government has already indicated its broad plans in this area. The chancellor has already outlined the path of spending until 2023-24 and the details of that will be unveiled in the comprehensive spending review. While the headline figure suggests an end of austerity, the breakdown, as we already know, suggests that there will be little scope to boost spending in the previously non-ringfenced areas. Thus the pressure will remain on these. In recent years, the combination of steady growth in nominal GDP and continued low rates and yields has allowed favourable debt dynamics to reduce the budget deficit. This trend could continue, and if so, should allow the government more room for fiscal manoeuvre.  Stephen Machin, professor, LSE
 Austerity has become politically very unpopular and so the government [must choose] between possible economic slowdown and being able to end austerity. The only thing that might save them here is that borrowing costs do not seem to have risen. Chris Martin, professor of economics, Bath university
 Yes. The need to get elected will trump everything. Costas Milas, professor of finance, University of Liverpool
 Assuming a Brexit deal takes place fairly quickly, the government will indeed act on its promise. If, on the other hand, political events lead to a Labour-led government, austerity will end much faster. David Miles, professor, Imperial College
 “Austerity” is too vague to mean much. So when it ends is hard to assess, when what it means is so unclear. If the question is will the government keep to its budget projections, the answer will depend on whether we get a year of very poor growth or not. Allan Monks, UK economist, JPMorgan
 Fiscal policy is projected to boost growth in 2019, but then return to a small net drag on growth in subsequent years. Barring an improvement in the UK’s sustainable growth rate, this means that austerity will have been paused rather than ended. Andrew Mountford, professor, Royal Holloway
 This is too big a topic to address in a few sentences but, since the financial crisis, the UK government debt has risen from about 35 per cent to about 85 per cent of UK GDP ie half of a year’s total production. This is a huge amount of resources that could have been spent improving the capacity and productivity of the UK economy for the future. Jacob Nell, chief UK economist, Morgan Stanley
 We expect a further moderate easing in fiscal policy, given the chancellor’s promise of a Brexit deal dividend, with the additional funds to be allocated in the 2019 spending review. We think this will end austerity from 2020, defined as real terms cuts in departmental budgets on average. However, with the majority of available resources already allocated to health, some departments will continue to face budgets which are falling in real terms. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist, CBI
 We’re making progress on the road to the end of austerity but we’re not there yet. The chancellor will face some tough choices on spending next year. We’ll be keeping an eye out for what we invest in skills and in education, particularly for the crucial age group of 16 to 18-year-olds. We also need to think again about our approach to life-long learning. Charles Nolan, professor, Glasgow university
 It will probably have bigger fish to fry! Austerity will continue for quite a few years to come for many areas of public expenditure. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science, Warwick university
 Slightly. David Owen, managing director and chief European economist, Jefferies
 Again so much depends on Brexit. In a no-deal scenario, there will be a pressing need for a fiscal response. But, yes, we are coming to the end of austerity — quite right too. Focus should be much more on the many other important longer-term issues facing the economy. Tej Parikh, senior economist, Institute of Directors
 To remedy the damaging effects of a long period of uncertainty on businesses, the chancellor will be under significant pressure to deliver further cost reliefs and investment incentives to spur economic activity back into life. Ann Pettifor, director, Policy Research in Macroeconomics 
 There is no real sign that the government intends to reverse austerity. While the Treasury might contribute some additional funding for the NHS to prevent the collapse of healthcare, this will not by itself end austerity. To do so would mean public spending increases of at least 2 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP to reverse the worst of the cuts in local government spending, including to education, police and social housing, as well as unfreezing benefits. The quality of life for UK citizens is likely to fall further John Philpott, The Jobs Economist
 I’m not sure if this promise amounts to anything more than political rhetoric. The mood music will yet again depend on the effect of Brexit on the public finances. Kallum Pickering, senior economist, Berenberg
 Not very far. Expect a little extra spending here and there that can lift medium-term demand a little but nothing that will alter the temperature of the economy much. Of course, any such boost is predicated on the UK avoiding a damaging no-deal hard Brexit. Chris Pissarides, professor, LSE
 I think they will do it, provided Philip Hammond remains chancellor, but they will do it in a Tory kind of way — don’t expect big social transfers. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy, King’s College, London
 The test of whether the government has made good its promise will be whether we see a real reversal in the rise in rough sleeping, demand for food banks, NHS waiting times and so on; levels of hardship for the most vulnerable in our society that would have been almost unimaginable a decade ago. My prediction would be that, assuming no change of government, we will see some rhetoric but little action: the government may reduce the scale of future cuts to some services, but will do very little to restore the very large and damaging cuts to disability and family benefits, social care, legal aid, justice, prisons and so on. Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser, Centre for Economics and Business Research
 It remains to be seen whether we are really seeing an end to austerity. The new spending review, due to be conducted during 2019, will show how far this is just empty words and whether there is a reversal of the underlying cuts to local authorities and many non-core government departments. The hope is that there will be some rethink and as Brexit pressures mount there will be an attempt to move extra funding support to areas actually contributing positively to the economy. This will of course require willingness to borrow more. The measures in the late October budget that allowed a small relaxation in public spending this financial year and in 2019/20 and beyond such as in the NHS appeared “costless” as they followed the discovery of extra money by the ONS and the Office for Budget Responsibility in the form of better annual income tax and corporate tax receipts than had originally been assumed. But a lot of that is now eaten away by the higher than previously thought change in the way student loans now appear in public finances, raising the deficit. The question is whether the chancellor will be happy/able/willing to continue to borrow more to assist the economy. It is true that borrowing is already expected to be about £40bn more this fiscal year alone than had been assumed just before the referendum vote and some of the self-imposed fiscal rules have been abandoned as a result but markets have been happy to fund this. No reason why they shouldn’t be happy to continue to do so unless we have political paralysis due to Brexit uncertainty. Sonali Punhani, UK economist, Credit Suisse
 We think that the chancellor is likely to postpone the end of austerity until Brexit negotiations are over and the future path of the economy is clearer. The chancellor can [take advantage] of the deal dividend if a deal is struck with the EU due to better growth forecasts, a surge in business investment and the freeing up some of the Brexit war chest saved for a no-deal Brexit. Ricardo Reis, LSE
 That is a question about politics, not economics. I do not know. Philip Rush, founder and chief economist, Heteronomics
 It will finally be able to allocate the ringfenced funds that would otherwise be sent to the EU. Saving some of them and spending the rest on squeezed priorities would help it pass more definitions of ending austerity. Restraint will inevitably remain in many areas, though. No government can ever fulfil all demands of it, even a socialist one. Yael Selfin, chief economist, KPMG
 The chancellor will have limited resources to spend this year, even in the event of a smooth Brexit, if he wants to meet his fiscal target. They will not be sufficient to end austerity on most measures unless he opts to raise taxes. Philip Shaw, chief economist, Investec
 The health service was given a considerable boost in the Budget. However excluding the NHS, real current spending is projected to remain flat over the next few years. To win an election in 2022, the government probably feels that it has to relax the purse strings and politically expediency will probably drive it in that direction. The extent of any spending boost will be determined by the performance of the economy, which provides a clear (if indirect) political justification for ensuring that a Brexit deal is struck relatively quickly. Andrew Simms, co-director, New Weather Institute
 It is, perhaps, too obvious to say that how far the government will act in 2019 on its promise to end austerity depends, not only on whether the government is still in office to enact its promise, but on who will be leading it. However, on its own terms at least, its promise to end austerity while simultaneously “balancing the books”, is a bit like promising to bake someone a cake while telling the shopkeeper from whom you bought the ingredients that you’re returning them because you’re overextended.  That said, I believe that from the outset, austerity was an opportunistic and ideologically motivated strategy to pursue longer term political objectives, and not a practical or sensible economic plan. It is something which has had the effect of harming those who were least responsible for the events which led to the policy, while the most responsible have subsequently gamed the system to escape harm or responsibility. It is a simple fact that requires frequent repeating, public investment in services generates economic activity which results in revenues. Intelligent public investment in future proofing the economy, for example in support for low carbon infrastructure and technology, helps build those sectors, crowd in wider investment, generate further employment and leave us all better off. The badly conducted experiment with quantitative easing (QE) did, nevertheless, prove the existence of the allegedly mythical “magic money tree”. The point is that if you do have the magic of public credit creation at your fingertips, you should do good with it, not, as was the case with QE, allow it to be frittered through the banks into the useless inflation of luxury assets. Nina Skero, director and head of macroeconomics, CEBR
 Government spending is rising quite sharply and this should take the edge off the virtually inevitable economic slowdown. Still, public sector spending is rather targeted and much of it focuses on the NHS. Hence, while austerity is coming to an end, not all areas of the economy will benefit equally. In the event of an especially stark downturn, Cebr believes the deficit should be allowed to increase with added spending on infrastructure and through allowing for the automatic fiscal stabilisers to come into operation. Andrew Smithers, author
 Some easing of constraints on expenditure are likely in health, police and perhaps education. Significant increases in taxes seem unlikely. Gary Styles, director, GPS Economics
 The government has the potential to smooth the way for an easier Brexit transition but I am not convinced this will be the most likely outcome. A weakened domestic economy and exchange rate may make it far more difficult for the government to actively ease fiscal policy in the short run. Focus is likely to return to the UK’s productivity woes and the growing issues of UK debt. Phil Thornton, director, Clarity Economics
 According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor would need to find £19bn from either extra taxes, more borrowing or higher than expected economic growth to fulfil his goals of ending austerity. They are the experts in this area. The government is unlikely to reverse its planned tax cuts and will not want to miss its budget targets. Growth is more likely to slow rather than accelerate. The most likely outcome is that the chancellor will, as he hinted in the Budget, use Brexit as the reason why the end to austerity will be delayed (again). Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics
 The government is being guided by public opinion, which no longer supports austerity. Cyclically adjusted public borrowing at present is expected to equal 1.3 per cent of GDP in 2020/21, but the government likely will use all of the scope it has to borrow while still meeting its 2 per cent target. The government will be forced to concede that it is no longer on track for an overall budget surplus by the mid-2020s, but few will care in the short term. Going forwards, fiscal policy no longer will dampen GDP growth, but austerity will feel like it is continuing, because spending won’t keep up with demand for public services, which will rise rapidly as the population continues to age. Kitty Ussher, economist and former Treasury minister
 It depends how you define austerity. Since the stock of debt has risen throughout the “austerity” period and there have been no budget surpluses, it is hard to see what things will look like when it supposedly ends. If the end of austerity means the end of unpopular fiscal decisions, then it is quite possible the government will act because there is more room for manoeuvre as tax receipts are rising and the stock of debt peaks. In addition, with so much uncertainty and unease, and a small parliamentary majority, there will be little political appetite (or political capital) to fight on any other fronts. John Van Reenen, professor, MIT economics department and Sloan management school
 It has not and it will not. If there is a second referendum which is won by Remain, it will give a growth boost to the economy that may help lift us out of the quagmire. But more radical reforms are needed to boost long-term productivity growth.  Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist, TS Lombard
 Austerity is coming to an end, but so are the positive fiscal surprises. As favourable domestic (job creation) and external (trade) macro conditions recede in 2019, the reality of deficient private demand will expose the chancellor’s fine balancing act between hitting fiscal targets, reducing debt and nurturing healthy economic growth. Fiscal policy is likely to remain broadly unchanged in the near term, but the difficult choices lie ahead. With monetary firepower virtually spent and the easy gains from sterling depreciation behind us, the direction of travel is towards a looser, pro-growth fiscal stance. Daniel Vernazza, chief UK and senior global economist, UniCredit
 Fiscal policy is likely to be eased in 2019 irrespective of Brexit, although the need for fiscal policy to do more to support the economy will be much greater if there is “no deal” with the EU. Keith Wade, chief economist, Schroders
 It is not clear what the promise means as the spending plans show an ongoing squeeze on underlying borrowing in 2019. Martin Weale, professor, King’s College
 Not very much. The new treatment of student loans shows the fiscal position to be worse than we had previously thought. With a high level of debt, fiscal space will arise only if productivity growth improves. But, even if that does happen, it will not appear in the OBR forecasts immediately. Simon Wells, chief European economist, HSBC
 The chancellor had a windfall in 2018 and he spent it on the NHS. So, in headline terms, per capita real-terms public spending is now projected to rise, not fall, over the coming years. In this sense, austerity has eased but with so much concentrated in health, it will continue in many other areas. Peter Westaway, chief economist, Vanguard Asset Management
 Austerity has two dimensions; in changes, it implies the shrinkage of the public sector deficit; in levels, it involves maintaining low levels of public service provision and public sector pay that followed from the deficit reduction. So even if plans are changed to stop the deficit shrinking, it is hard to see how meaningful improvements can be made to public services to reverse the earlier years of austerity. In the most likely scenario of Brexit occurring, the medium-term impact on the public finances is likely to be negative (notwithstanding the short-term boost to incomes this year as sentiment improves). Against a previous policy intention to continue with public spending restraint, it will take a truly monumental U-turn in policy for austerity to be ended. If there is a change of government, something that could result from a Brexit-related fall in the government, a newly elected Labour government would very likely undertake a moderate-to-large fiscal expansion, mainly focused on increased public spending with offsetting increases in taxation mainly targeted on high earners. Even for a new Labour government, the legacy of years of austerity will not be easy to reverse quickly. Matthew Whittaker, deputy director, Resolution Foundation
 The chancellor delivered a significant easing of austerity at the Budget, reversing plans for further cuts in overall spending on day-to-day public services. But, with the NHS consuming almost all of the extra spending set out, austerity remains firmly in place for most parts of government. And any promise of an “end to austerity” must ring hollow among lower-income households for as long as the squeeze on social security remains in place. Delivering a true “end to austerity” in 2019, therefore, comes with a sizeable price tag. The chancellor has previously promised that he would look to utilise the £15bn headroom he has relative to his fiscal “mandate” once it became clear he no longer needed to keep anything back in reserve in case of a no-deal Brexit. Setting aside the possibility that no-deal may yet still arrive, his ability to follow through on that promise looks somewhat constrained. In part that is because he remains wedded to the hope of lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio, and in part it is because the ONS’s recent decision to bring student loans on to the borrowing books looks like almost entirely wiping out the chancellor’s headroom. He could sidestep this second barrier by changing either the approach to student finances or the details of his fiscal rules, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. The scale of the task involved in “ending austerity” means that he, or his successor, will inevitably need to explore options for raising taxes over the coming years, however politically difficult that might seem. Mike Wickens, professor, University of York
 Very unlikely, except as a compensation for any negative consequences from Brexit. It remains to be seen how the government will react to the effects on the fiscal deficit of the recent reclassification of student debt. As it is a purely accounting issue, it should have no effect, but these days one doubts the competence of the Treasury’s macroeconomists. Trevor Williams, visiting professor, University of Derby
 First, austerity will not end. Budget cuts are still built into the forward projections. However, a slowing economy, fewer net migrants and so weaker tax revenue growth, alongside contingency spending for Brexit will push the deficit above the target in the autumn Budget. Alastair Winter, chief economist, Daniel Stewart & Company
 There is very little scope for a major stimulus without resorting to major borrowing. Taxes, if anything, may have to rise if higher current expenditure is to be financed from current income. There is a backlog of claims for public sector wages and “underfunded” services. More talk than action in 2019 but that should change in the run-up to the next general election. Garry Young, NIESR
 It will be difficult for the government to go back on what it has already promised, but the extra public spending that is currently planned will not go very far. Overall spending is planned to remain at around its current fairly low level as a share of GDP and that probably cannot deliver the quality of public services that most people would like. The chancellor said that austerity is “coming to an end”, but it probably cannot begin to be ended entirely without tax rises. But after years of piecemeal tax measures, it is not clear which taxes ought to change in order to fund a more significant increase in public spending. That is why we at the institute have argued for a comprehensive tax review to improve the efficiency and fairness of the tax system. Such a review is desirable in its own right, but is especially needed in the light of demographic challenges that require extra public spending on health and social care that must ultimately be funded out of taxes. Linda Yueh, adjunct professor of economics, London Business School
 The government has already essentially pledged to spend the “windfall” on the NHS so it will need to find another £19bn in public spending to keep departmental spending unchanged by 2022-23 to stick to the pledge to end austerity. But as that is a few years out, the government will probably increase public spending in 2019 to address urgent issues such as the NHS and social care as well preparing for Brexit. Azad Zangana, senior economist, Schroders
 Based on the details of the last Budget, not at all. The structural deficit is still forecast to shrink, which is the definition of active fiscal tightening. This could change with work on the next spending review in 2019, but we do not expect a significant change in direction. Name withheld
 It is such a secondary issue right now that it will hardly be on the agenda. They will most likely end austerity. How will monetary policy change in 2019? Do you think the Bank of England will get it right? Howard Archer, chief economic adviser, EY ITEM Club
 The Bank of England has come in for significant criticism in some quarters for not being aggressive enough in raising interest rates. However, we believe that the major uncertainties facing the UK economy have justified a cautious approach and we believe the BoE will continue to act judiciously. On the assumption that the UK and the EU ultimately enact a Brexit transition arrangement in March 2019 and the UK economy holds up in the immediate aftermath of the exit from the EU, we believe the Bank of England could very well raise interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent in May. However, it is entirely possible that the BoE could hold off hiking interest rates until August as the MPC may want to see sustained evidence that the economy is holding up in the aftermath of the UK leaving the EU.  We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist — with lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive BoE action. Should there be a no-deal UK exit from the EU at the end of March, the growth and interest rate outlook will potentially be very different. The BoE indicates that interest rates could either go up or down should there be a no-deal UK exit from the EU, depending on the balance of how the UK’s supply capacity and demand side of the economy are perceived to be affected. Exchange-rate movements will also be a factor. We strongly lean towards the view that interest rates would be far more likely to be cut than increased if there is a no-deal Brexit. Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics, LSE
 The Bank of England appears to be the last bastion of sanity, hence a good chance of getting it right. Ray Barrell, professor, Brunel university
 Monetary policy will probably involve higher interest rates in 2019. The BoE will not get it right (except by chance) but it can be expected to make the right decisions given the information to hand. Marian Bell, Alpha Economics
 Again, Brexit-related uncertainty means it is impossible to predict the path of monetary policy. It won’t be easy, given the uncertainty, but the likelihood is that the Bank of England will respond to developments by balancing demand with the potentially reduced supply potential of the economy, together with the implications of exchange rate movements, to keep inflation at a rate which is relatively low historically. Neil Blake, global head of forecasting, CBRE
 Caution sounds like the right approach. Beware of inflation expectations but be aware of weak economic growth. Danny Blanchflower, professor, Dartmouth College
 If there is a cliff-edge Brexit there is zero chance the MPC would rises rates to 5.5 per cent as GDP plummets and unemployment rises. So the bank rate will remain low and if there is a disastrous cliff-edge Brexit rates will go negative and QE will restart. I see no prospect of rates rising in 2019. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy, Imperial College
 The Bank of England is not reporting enough on markets which are most sensitive to monetary policy — for example, the housing market. Without the Help to Buy subsidy we would already be having a steep fall in house prices. The bank needs to watch for signs of a confidence collapse in markets such as housing and cars, which are most sensitive to Brexit loss of consumer confidence. In general, interest rates are more set by markets now than by the bank’s rate. The monetary committee deliberations are showing disconnect from real world risks. Monetary monitoring has to be much more market specific. George Buckley, Nomura
 Expect two hikes per year (May and Nov 2019). We have recently put back our forecast for the first hike from Feb to May thanks to Brexit uncertainty weakening the data in the run-up to the Feb meeting. However, we continue to expect two moves per year, the result of the fact that if the bank didn’t do anything on policy they would be missing the target on the upside by close to 0.4 per cent. Based on rules of thumb, that would require about 100bp of hikes over the coming two years to bring back to target. Thus our view of two 25bp hikes per year. No-deal would end up with the bank loosening policy which we think would be the right approach. Jagjit Chadha, NIESR
 If we end up leaving the EU in orderly manner with some form of deal that allows trade to continue mostly uninterrupted, I would expect some further, gradual removal of monetary accommodation. A more disorderly exit would pose more complications but to the extent that demand varies by more than supply in the first instance and that inflation expectations remain well anchored, the MPC has considerable flexibility to stabilise output in the short run and still hit its inflation mandate which it has done since establishment by lowering the expected path of the bank rate. It will perhaps be more interesting to observe, in the event of a disorderly exit from the EU, how the FPC will respond to the elevated risks the financial sector would be taking on by lending in that state of the world. The financial sector would be taking on the “socially” helpful task helping to stabilise output but at a cost of more risk. If the FPC is concerned only about financial risk, it ought to limit that activity but it probably would not. David Cobham, professor, Heriot-Watt University
 One has to feel more confidence in the bank than in the government, because the bank’s decision makers include some people who can and want to ask the awkward questions, and it doesn’t have to win an election.  However, it is not clear that the bank has faced up to all the questions concerning its pre-crisis behaviour, and there are still too many people (outside as well as inside) who view the current period as a deviation before a return to the old ways of doing things. And more importantly any reset of macroeconomic policy needs major changes to fiscal policy itself and its relation to monetary policy, and there is no sign of either. Brian Coulton, chief economist, Fitch Ratings
 If no-deal is avoided then we see one hike next year. It will be a big challenge for the BoE if we get no deal. The economy will weaken sharply but inflation will rise thanks to tariffs on UK-EU trade and the sterling sell-off that will probably accompany no-deal. We think on balance the BoE is more likely to follow the post-referendum playbook and ease policy rather than react to the breach of the inflation target. But they are keeping their options wide open. It would really depend on how sustained any sterling sell off proved to be. Bronwyn Curtis, independent economist
 Given what the Bank of England has implied in its recent comments, I would expect the MPC to raise rates by 25bp, probably in May. As we will get some clarity in Q1 on Brexit, that outcome will define what they do in 2019 rather than anything they have said recently.  The MPC’s natural tendency seems to be to do nothing, so if high levels of uncertainty over Brexit remain during Q1, then that is what they will do. I envisage them doing nothing for the whole year unless there is a sterling crisis, in which case they will hike rates to contain the inflationary outcome. I am not convinced that this would be the right response as we have seen periods in the past when a fall in sterling has not resulted in a surge in inflation in the domestic economy.  We will not know for quite a long time, well after 2019, whether the BoE have got it right or not as the lags are long and disentangling the combined effects of monetary and fiscal policy is difficult. I’m not yet convinced that they will get it right. They should have been tightening monetary policy in 2018. It was still at emergency loose levels even though the economy was growing. The distortions created by excessive borrowing at such low levels of interest rates now makes companies and households more sensitive to even small rate rises.  Howard Davies, chairman, RBS
 Very little, I expect. The bank missed the chance to normalise policy further over the last couple of years. Now the economy will not be strong enough to wear significant interest rate rises. Panicos Demetriades, professor of financial economics, University of Leicester
 The Bank of England will have a tough job if Brexit materialises. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, it will face a poisoned chalice: rising inflation, a rapidly shrinking economy and additional uncertainty. I wouldn’t like to be in their shoes if that scenario materialises. If on the other hand, there is a people’s vote and Remain prevails, the job of the Bank of England will be much easier. Inflation will be subdued, although with a return to healthier growth and increased consumption and investment, there could be medium-term pressures on inflation and the bank may eventually need to raise rates. Wouter den Haan, professor, LSE
 Monetary policy will be easy relative to the other policy decisions that have to be made. UK monetary policy is in capable hands. Let’s be grateful for an independent Bank of England. Swati Dhingra, LSE
 Possibly more QE, especially if the economic slowdown happens quickly. The BoE also has to deal with new ringfencing laws so quite likely a period of experimentation and learning for monetary policy. Peter Dixon, economist, Commerzbank
 Most people agree that the BoE would have tightened more by now were it not for Brexit. The extent to which it will be able to act in 2019 thus depends on what happens here. I assume a business-as-usual, no hard Brexit outcome (either the Withdrawal Agreement is accepted or, more likely, the Article 50 period is extended) which gives the BoE scope to focus on the fundamentals. Clear evidence that wage growth has accelerated since mid-2018, appears to vindicate the BoE’s warning that the economy is operating with very little spare capacity and on the basis of my scenario, I would expect at least one — and maybe two — rate hikes in 2019. But risks are tilted to the downside since there are indications that the global economy is losing momentum which will have an adverse impact on the UK. Noble Francis, economics director, Construction Products Association
 Since the financial crisis, the bank has persistently been reactive rather than proactive. The Bank of England has effectively pencilled in a rate rise once the data show that UK economic growth has been sustained into the implementation period. This means after a deal is done with the EU that passes through the UK Parliament and then a lag for the macroeconomic data being published covering Q1 and early data for Q2 so, realistically, we are looking at the second half of 2019. If we end up with no deal then the bank has indicated that it would raise rates to counteract the impacts of sterling depreciations and import price rises but, realistically, if UK economic activity was negatively affected it is highly unlikely that the bank would raise rates and harm UK GDP further. Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, LSE
 The Bank of England will be Brexit driven and outcome dependent. If we should have a Brexit no-deal, there is probably no such thing as a perfectly correct monetary policy. There will be a need to make the best of a bad deal. Andy Goodwin, associate director, Oxford Economics
 The MPC has a clear bias to normalise policy and its latest forecasts hint at a desire to hike twice in 2019, if Brexit is orderly. But inflation has consistently undershot the MPC’s forecasts over the past two years and we had expected that to be the case again, even before the recent collapse in the oil price — the forecasts are now almost certain to prove too high. We are also sceptical that wage growth will continue to accelerate. So even though the MPC appears keen to hike, we suspect that it will struggle to justify more than one hike in 2019 and it may be forced to keep Bank Rate at 0.75 per cent all year. Mark Gregory, chief economist, EY
 Monetary policy will be cautious until the way forward on Brexit is clearer. I think the Bank of England is too bullish on prospects for the economy and over-concerned about inflation and so I believe there is a good chance they will tighten too quickly. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics
 If something close to Theresa May’s deal is ratified in Parliament, we expect the economy to grow more solidly than most forecasters anticipate next year. Meanwhile, the Monetary Policy Committee will be keen to limit the distortions associated with low interest rates and replenish ammunition with which to respond to future economic shocks. We anticipate three 25bp hikes in 2019 taking Bank Rate to 1.50 per cent by the end of that year. Admittedly, the decision to provide policy support in a disruptive no-deal Brexit would not be an open and shut case. But despite the Bank of England’s warnings that it is just as likely to raise as to cut interest rates, we still think that the MPC would loosen policy — perhaps from the current 0.75 per cent to 0.50 per cent or 0.25 per cent. Rebecca Harding, chief executive, Coriolis Technologies
 Monetary policy will be driven in 2019 by Brexit and its aftermath and will be underpinned by tighter macro-prudential rules in the likely event of interest rates remaining as they are. The MPC itself appeared unwilling to give any form of forward guidance in its December meeting but simply pointed to the uncertainties that surround the UK economy at present. Growth is likely to be sluggish, because of Brexit and because of wider global geopolitical and geoeconomics risks, notably the threat of a broader trade war between China and the US and slowing growth in Asia. The Bank of England will be watching for any signs of capital outflow and will use macro-prudential policy, particularly counter-cyclical capital buffers, to maintain the stability of the UK financial system. Its approach is likely to be similar to that after the referendum in 2016 when interest rates fell and capital buffers were used alongside measures to ensure that interest rate cuts were passed on to borrowers. Arguably the Bank of England got macro prudential policy right at that point, although the interest rate cut was, perhaps, unnecessary. Rates are still historically low, and the MPC will not be looking to cut further and it is unlikely that they will rise during 2019 if uncertainty persists. John Hawksworth, chief economist, PwC
 If there is a reasonably smooth Brexit, we would expect the Bank of England to continue with gradual rises in interest rates, starting with a 25 basis-point rise some time in mid-2019. If there is a disorderly Brexit, then we would expect the bank to seek to mitigate the pain through the same kind of relaxation of monetary policy as we saw in August 2016. But there are limits to how much effect this would have given that rates are starting from a low level, so much of the burden of responding to such a shock would need to fall on fiscal policy. Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist, Société Générale
 Bank rate will be increased to 1 per cent in May but there is a risk of later. A central bank never gets it right because they don’t have perfect foresight! Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist, BNP Paribas
 I don’t envy the Monetary Policy Committee at present. They face an extremely uncertain outlook, and a backdrop of increased calls to provide more concrete guidance over the likely path for interest rates. We think that the Bank of England is essentially waiting for the green light from Brexit before hiking interest rates. Assuming there is an orderly Brexit outcome, we would expect two hikes in 2019, although not until May at the earliest for the next one. If there is a disorderly Brexit, we don’t think the MPC will be in a rush to hike interest rates, even if there is a currency-driven rise in inflation. If anything, our bias is towards policy support, rather than tightening. Ethan Ilzetzki, lecturer, LSE
 With wage pressures increasing and US interest rates rising, I expect the bank will be forced to raise interest rates up to twice this year. Last year I overestimated the degree of tightening in 2018. The bank’s (legitimate) concerns about Brexit uncertainty have led to a “wait and see” approach, despite some signs of inflationary pressure. It is therefore likely that the bank will backload rate increases and do so only when inflation is manifestly over its target. Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist, BCA Research
 As in the evolution of most things in the UK in 2019, monetary policy will hinge on whether the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit or not. In any case, the recent collapse in the crude oil price will pull down inflation in early 2019, removing the need for an imminent hike to interest rates. But later in the year, the BoE is likely to tighten policy conditional on the UK avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Stephen King, HSBC
 Very little change but, again, it’s all contingent on Brexit. “Getting it right” in a world of massive uncertainty is a big ask, particularly when the yardsticks of success are so tricky. We know by now that achieving price stability alone is not a sign of lasting economic success: if it had been, there would have been no global financial crisis. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist, Joseph Rowntree Foundation
 If the growth in average real wages continues, other things being equal, we would see gradual increases in interest rates. However, a hard Brexit bring two threats: reduced growth, and higher inflation, and the bank will be torn between lower rates to avoid intensifying the downturn, and higher rates to bring inflation under control. In the last recession and slow recovery, the first objective dominated, and higher inflation was tolerated on the basis that its causes were short-term. I’d expect the same reaction to Brexit-related risks so the bank will probably delay increasing interest rates if they perceive the risks of Brexit-related economic contraction have increased. Ruth Lea, economic adviser, Arbuthnot Banking Group
 Monetary policy will probably change little in 2019, whatever the Brexit scenario. As said, above, in a no-deal situation, the economy may weaken modestly (and the pound would probably wobble) and the bank, under these circumstances, may hold off tightening policy. (I do not believe the bank would dramatically raise rates if no deal, whatever the economic consequences.) Indeed the bank may even relax policy by either cutting interest rates and/or more QE — but I do not regard this as likely. In a deal scenario, the bank may feel the need to raise rates by, say, 0.25bp during 2019. Unemployment is now very low, the economy is now pretty much at full capacity, and the bank may feel the need to head off the potential build-up of internally generated inflationary pressures.  John Llewellyn, Llewellyn Consulting
 Sterling’s performance will have a huge influence. A collapse in the pound due to a hard Brexit would raise the Argentine conundrum: raise rates to support the currency and damp domestic demand; or curb rates to support activity and head off social pressures. There never is an acceptable answer. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist, Netwealth
 I expect monetary policy to be on hold in the early months of the year. There has already been significant monetary policy tightening over the past year. The combination of a small tweak in rates, ending of lending schemes, hike in counter-cyclical capital buffers, plus, perhaps, more general tightening of lending as a result of micro-prudential measures, has led to sluggish lending and monetary growth. While rates are low and sterling is competitive, financial conditions are far from loose.  Will the Bank of England get it right? Naturally, I hope so. While there is some excellent analysis that comes out of the BoE, their forward guidance on the economy has left much to be desired. My view is that there should be a bias towards easing early in the year, aimed at stimulating lending and monetary growth, but as the year progresses there may be scope to change the bias towards tightening. To get it right, the BoE needs to be gradual and predictable in its actions. Stephen Machin, professor, LSE
 Whilst real wage growth stays weak, it would not seem sensible to raise interest rates. Will the Bank of England get it right, they don’t seem to have done so well so far, but more QE would seem to be on the cards. Chris Martin, professor of economics, Bath university
 With an EU transition, I expect the policy rate to be no more than 50 points higher by year-end. Without a transition, I expect the policy rate to fall as low as it can. Costas Milas, professor of finance, University of Liverpool
 This depends on Brexit-related events. To the extent that we avoid a no-deal Brexit, it is more likely than not that we will see at least one interest rate hike. If, on the other hand, a no-deal Brexit occurs, it is more likely than not that Mark Carney and his MPC colleagues will intervene by cutting the policy rate and/or authorising additional quantitative easing. Either way, I trust that BoE officials will get it right. Andrew Mountford, professor, Royal Holloway
 Again this is too big a topic to address in a few sentences. Ensuring financial stability in a global market, with political players, tax shifting and regulatory arbitrage is not a straightforward task (although I’d have thought reducing the dominance of UK housing on UK banks’ balance sheets would play a part). David Miles, professor, Imperial College
 Interest rates seem unlikely to change much at all. If there is a sharp shock around Brexit the scope to cut rates is limited as would be the willingness to raise rates. Allan Monks, UK economist, JPMorgan
 While many have focused on the weakness in demand growth, a point often missed is the even weaker supply backdrop. Work-related net immigration from the EU has slowed sharply, while the sustained weakness in business investment is likely to be restraining already weak productivity growth. We estimate these developments, which have resulted from the Brexit vote, have lowered the UK’s effective potential GDP growth rate by 0.6 percentage points to 1.0-1.5 per cent. Jacob Nell, chief UK economist, Morgan Stanley
 We expect Brexit uncertainty and weaker growth will keep the MPC on hold at the start of the year but we see the MPC tightening — likely with 2 hikes and an early start to QE unwind — once a hard Brexit has been ruled out and growth has started to recover. We think the MPC have a hawkish bias given an economy running at capacity, inflationary pressure from looser fiscal policy and a tight labour market, and rates still well below neutral. Given our view that the economy is currently running at capacity and that growth in a soft Brexit will run significantly above the economy’s reduced potential, we forecast a widening positive output gap and rising inflationary pressure. In this context, we think that the risk is that the MPC are slow to pick up the pace of tightening, and inflation holds above target for a sustained period. However, since the MPC is alert to these risks, we expect them to deliver an appropriate policy response. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist, CBI
 Assuming a smooth transition, I expect interest rates to end the year at 1.25 per cent. Despite inflation falling back, the MPC have a clear eye on domestic cost pressures building. Labour market indicators are tight and skill shortages are biting. Wage growth is showing more signs of life recently, and with weak productivity growth, this is pushing unit labour costs higher. So we will see limited and gradual rate rises, around two next year bringing rates to 1.25 per cent — with low interest rates still supporting growth. But if we have a no-deal Brexit or continued uncertainty slows growth further, then those interest rate rises will fade further into the future. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science, Warwick university
 Very difficult to say because we do not yet know how hard our Brexit will be. If there were a collapse of confidence in the summer of 2019, it is likely that it would encourage comparative dove-ishness from the bank. Probably, yes, the bank will. David Owen, managing director and chief European economist, Jefferies
 With wages accelerating, the bar for raising rates is very low. This is a common theme in many countries, with more focus on financial imbalances and financial stability that have developed since the financial crisis. One can certainly envisage a scenario when the BoE raises rates twice in 2019 and in a no-deal scenario we can certainty buy the view that they are raising rates if supply falls a lot faster than demand, and sterling weakens.  If in a no-deal scenario this is combined with maximum political uncertainty then sterling could be marked down quickly. The UK current account deficit widened out again to almost 5 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2018, increasing such risks. Since the 2016 referendum it has been largely financed by net foreign buying of UK Gilts, in large part courtesy of the ECB and QE. But this has now come to an end.  As far as the BoE is concerned the situation is different to 2016 when there was still an output gap and wages hadn’t accelerated. If the BoE does raise rates twice in 2019 in a managed Brexit scenario, focus will start to switch more to the BoE’s balance sheet and how best to shrink it. On balance, we expect the BoE to get the big decisions broadly right. Tej Parikh, senior economist, Institute of Directors
 A deal should give the BoE the scope to make a few rate hikes next year. But the MPC will need to be careful not to overestimate the impact of a tight labour market on the potential for wage inflation. They should keep in mind that elevated business costs and productivity challenges are likely to restrain significant salary rises, particularly in SMEs. On the other hand, a no-deal [Brexit] might push the MPC into expanding QE or other extraordinary liquidity injection measures. Ann Pettifor, director, Policy Research in Macroeconomics 
 After hinting that rates would rise, the Bank of England hesitated in 2018. This suggests that the MPC has understood the scale of the UK’s economic weakness, and is therefore likely to get it right in 2019. In the event of a chaotic Brexit the BoE will lower rates. However the impact will be limited, if a cut in rates is not accompanied by expansionary fiscal policy. John Philpott, The Jobs Economist
 Brexit dependent again. I’m sure the bank will endeavour to do its best. Kallum Pickering, senior economist, Berenberg
 Yes, the BoE will get it right. With economic growth likely to run slightly above trend and clear signs of tightness in the labour market, there is a strong case for the BoE to continue to gradually normalise monetary policy in 2019. It is highly unlikely that the BoE would hike rates again before the Brexit question is settled. May is therefore the most likely date for the next hike. As long as the UK avoids a no-deal hard Brexit, expect the BoE to pick up the pace of rate hikes to two per year in 2019 and 2020 as wage growth edges further above 3 per cent year on year. This would take the Bank Rate to 1.75 per cent by the end of 2020. Christopher Pissarides, professor, LSE
 I expect a very moderate rise in interest rates. From today’s perspective they will get it right but given the large uncertainties (and not only Brexit, there is also Trump and Xi to consider) by 2020 it might turn out to have been wrong. In view of these uncertainties more caution is probably the right attitude. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy, King’s College, London
 Obviously, this too depends on Brexit, but I think that as the economy weakens the bank will (rightly) be reluctant to raise rates quickly. If there is a short-term fix other than no deal, rates might rise by 0.25bp or 0.5bp, but still remain at historically very low levels. In a chaotic no-deal scenario, I think it’s highly implausible that the bank would raise rates. Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser, Centre for Economics and Business Research
 I would be very surprised if in the period of uncertainty ahead monetary policy was tightened to any significant extent. Indeed, should there be a no deal or a Brexit outcome, however interim, that would be seen as possibly destabilising for the markets the BoE would, if necessary, reduce interest rates again and inject even more liquidity into the markets just as it did after the referendum vote in mid-2016. Sonali Punhani, UK economist, Credit Suisse
 The Bank of England delivered its expected rate hike in August. Going forward, the range of potential outcomes is wide and Brexit is the biggest risk to the economy. If a smooth Brexit path eventually becomes clear (which is the BoE’s assumption), rates are likely to rise quicker than markets expect and the BoE is likely to turn hawkish on the back of building wage pressures, fiscal stimulus announced in the Autumn Budget as well as a likely rebound in growth. Ricardo Reis, LSE
 It all depends on Brexit. Any responsible forecast has to be conditional on what the final outcome is. Different outcomes require very different policies. Any unconditional forecast, as asked in this question, is ultimately very far from what happens. Philip Rush, founder and chief economist, Heteronomics
 I continue to expect two rate hikes from the BoE during 2019 (May and Nov). As ever, the optimal response will be state-dependent. Clarity about the Brexit process smoothly transitioning is needed before the MPC can confidently remove some more monetary stimulus. The delay in the interim means it may appear to have waited too long with the benefit of hindsight. However, given the current information set, it is appropriate to wait a little longer than it might otherwise have done, in my view. Yael Selfin, chief economist, KPMG
 The Bank of England is concerned about rising inflationary pressures and is likely to raise rates at least once more in 2019 if a Brexit transition deal is agreed. However, in the event of a disorderly Brexit, it is likely to step in and support lending markets and the economy more broadly so that businesses can step up investment to recover productive capacity. Philip Shaw, chief economist, Investec
 On a speedily agreed deal, the economy gathers a modest degree of steam and the BoE goes back to focusing on the labour market and the possible impact of expansionary fiscal policy. Of course, things would get much more complex on a no-deal out-turn. The MPC has insisted that it could raise rates on a disorderly Brexit, given a negative impact on supply in the economy, a likely fall in the exchange rate and the imposition of tariffs. The point of comparison is of course the post-referendum period in 2016, when the committee eased policy. Admittedly, the two situations are not exactly the same. For example, as the BoE points out, the starting point of inflation is materially higher now than it was then. But the argument that there is currently next to zero economic slack is a curious one, given that the fall in GDP would almost certainly result in greater capacity (ie unemployment is likely to rise). We consider it difficult to envisage the MPC tightening policy in these circumstances. It is more likely that the committee would cut rates again, albeit perhaps not immediately. We hope that the MPC is not put to the test. Andrew Simms, co-director, New Weather Institute
 With so much uncertainty elsewhere, it is extremely unlikely, barring the need for urgent action in the light any sudden Brexit shocks, that the Bank of England will dramatically change course. Their cautious watch and holding of interest rate rises in the face of a tentative UK economy will probably continue.  But it is important to remember that a wider range of factors than the bank’s interest-rate setting influence the cost of capital to key sectors. For sectors which are supposedly key to the government’s industrial strategy, and include building “a low carbon, more resource-efficient economy”, policy certainty, regulation and resulting perceptions of risk are key. The government is promising that the UK will grow whole new industries and transform existing ones. Yet solar power has been shut out from the energy sector’s Contracts for Difference for years and onshore wind been starved of even the slightest breeze of official support. Meanwhile, the government is ending the export tariff which allows small, often household solar generators to get a fair price for the surplus electricity they export to the grid. All these risks and uncertainties raise the cost of capital to the sector showing the need for much greater joined-up policymaking. Nina Skero, director and head of macroeconomics, CEBR
 The Bank of England is keen to normalise monetary policy and would be willing to look through some signs of continued economic weakness in order to achieve this. CEBR expects Base Rate to remain unchanged until Q3 2019 at which point we believe the Monetary Policy Committee will return to a path of monetary policy normalisation by gradually starting to increase rates. Andrew Smithers, author
 Growth seems currently in line with its potential circa 1 per cent per annum. Monetary policy will need to change if it speeds up. If it slows then fiscal policy will probably ease. The most likely outcome is that monetary policy will be unchanged. Gary Styles, director, GPS Economics
 I expect inflation to surprise on the upside and as a result the bank will be under increasing pressure to tighten policy. A weak exchange rate and higher inflation may not be sufficient to get the bank to tighten policy quickly but the pressure will grow over 2019 and 2020. A slow response from the bank may lead to significantly higher interest rates in the medium term. Suren Thiru, head of economics and business finance, British Chambers of Commerce
 The Monetary Policy Committee is likely to increase interest rates once in 2019 to 1 per cent, with the next rate rise likely in the final quarter of the year. However, the Bank of England’s current approach to monetary policy is a concern as it appears to be overly focused on reinforcing a pre-determined path for rates, rather than on economic conditions — a course of action that could further undermine business and consumer confidence. Phil Thornton, director, Clarity Economics
 Oh dear — we are back to Brexit. The more an outcome and the less likely that growth will slow and the more likely that the MPC will want to focus on the increasingly tight labour market and rising wages. But this may all be overshadowed by the extent to which the world economy continues on a path of a synchronised slowdown and the impact from any worsening in trade relations between the United States and China. If the Bank of England gets it wrong, they are unlikely to be on their own. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics
 The MPC will have to respond quickly to any pick-up in GDP growth following a Brexit deal being signed off, given its views that the economy already is heading for a period of excess demand and that Bank Rate still is well below its equilibrium level. The effective interest rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages also will continue to decline, as households refinance old loans at cheaper rates, unless the MPC hikes interest rates this year. Accordingly, we expect the MPC to raise Bank Rate to 1.00 per cent in May and then to 1.25 per cent in November. This will catch markets by surprise, which currently are pricing-in only a 60 per cent chance of one increase in Bank Rate by the end of 2019. Kitty Ussher, economist and former Treasury minister
 It has shown an ability to be responsive to changes in the economic mood; I would expect it to be a stabilising influence. John Van Reenen, professor, MIT economics department and Sloan management school
 This all depends on Brexit. A no-deal will mean huge turmoil and attempted monetary easing, but since the long-term Brexit damage is structural, not temporary/cyclical, there is little that monetary or fiscal policy can do to staunch the flow of economic blood loss. Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist, TS Lombard
 Depressed consumer confidence means that, contrary to the MPC’s central projection, there is a good chance that households will not boost spending in line with real earnings. In such a scenario, domestically generated inflation would most likely undershoot expectations, complicating the bank’s envisaged “gradual and limited” rate hike path. There are also reasons to think that the response of wages to changes in unemployment is smaller than in the past, consistent with a flatter Philips curve that has shifted lower. As real incomes gradually improve and the attractiveness of hiring additional labour relative to capital investment reaches its limits, we may be entering the early stages of a turnround in productivity. So labour market slack may be somewhat less limited than the bank is pencilling in. The MPC says the appropriate policy response to Brexit “will not be automatic and could be in either direction”. Yet it is hard to see how the committee could avoid a rate cut in response to the economic and financial market turbulence that would result from a crash-out Brexit. With an orderly Brexit, the bar for a policy reversal is high, however. This is both from a fundamental and a risk-management standpoint, not least with a view to safeguarding exchange rate stability. After all, the MPC thinks the equilibrium real interest rate (‘R-star’) is likely to rise further towards trend as uncertainty dissipates and fiscal austerity is gradually scaled back. Daniel Vernazza, chief UK and senior global economist, UniCredit
 If, as I expect, there is an orderly exit from the EU, then the Bank of England will likely hike the bank rate by 25bp in May next year; that is, after a couple of months have passed post-March 2019 to confirm their expectations of a recovery in business activity. After that, the bank is likely to pause for the rest of the year amid a slowdown in the global economy. With hindsight, it will probably prove to be a mistake by the bank to continue its tightening cycle into 2019. In the event of a disorderly exit, the bank has been at pains to say that monetary policy could move in either direction depending on the exchange rate and the balance of demand and supply, although in reality it would very likely cut rates — at least initially — to support demand. Keith Wade, chief economist, Schroders
 The real challenge for the Bank of England would be in the event of a hard Brexit where the pound drops significantly. Higher inflation would have to be balanced against weaker activity in setting monetary policy. Similar to 2016, but the economy is more advanced in its cycle with greater risk of a sustained rise in inflation. Martin Weale, professor, King’s College
 Monetary policy will need to strike a balance between the tight state of the labour market at present and the effects of possible very weak growth or contraction arising from Brexit. But, since I do not know how Brexit will be resolved it is not possible to guess where that balance may be. It is not very helpful to describe the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (it is not the bank which decides on monetary policy) as either right or wrong. Each member makes their own decision based on their interpretation of the evidence. Even if hindsight suggests some other decision might have been more appropriate that does not mean that the decisions are wrong. The range of opinions offered by commentators means that there are always some who with hindsight made “better” judgments than the members of the MPC but that does not mean that members of the committee were wrong. Simon Wells, chief European economist, HSBC
 So much depends on Brexit. The MPC seems minded to tighten policy further due to the tight labour market. However, the low oil price, tighter global financial conditions and a slowing world economy means things could have changed by the time more clarity emerges. Peter Westaway, chief economist, Vanguard Asset Management
 Under the most likely scenario of a Brexit deal (either compromise May or Norway soft), the MPC will begin a pre-emptive tightening of policy during 2019, with at least 2 rate hikes as activity picks up in an environment of increased optimism about the UK economy. If Brexit were to be stopped, the MPC may need to act even more decisively and raise rates even more aggressively, although headline inflation would be held back by the surge in sterling. In these upbeat scenarios, the MPC would likely judge the tightening appropriately although calibrating it correctly in the no-Brexit case may be a challenge. Most interesting is the tail-risk possibility of a no-deal Brexit where a probable collapse in activity would pose a considerable dilemma for the MPC. Would the demand shock of a collapse in confidence require a cut in rates, or the supply shock of failing supply lines and impeded labour supply require an increase in rates? It is unlikely that the MPC will have the required luck and judgment to gauge the policy response appropriately in this scenario. Matthew Whittaker, deputy director, Resolution Foundation
 In the event of a no-deal Brexit, monetary policy is likely to change very rapidly and with as much gusto as the MPC can achieve. It will be hard to calibrate just how much action will be needed, but the bank is likely to want to act first and ask questions later. Under a more orderly transition, there’s every chance the bank chooses to bide its time. Inflation is almost at target and there are enough factors pulling in different directions (wage pressure is building, but house-price growth is slowing) to warrant plotting a steady-as-she-goes course while Brexit starts to play out. My guess would be that rates move by no more than 25bp over the course of 2019. Mike Wickens, professor, University of York
 The bank has not got it right for several years and I am not expecting any change soon. As it is unlikely to respond to the UK’s needs, the interesting question is how it responds to the recent tightening of US monetary policy. The right policy is to respond to higher UK inflation and to maintaining the real exchange rate following US interest rate hikes, but it might just continue its highly political stance by allowing the real exchange rate to drift downwards to offset Brexit. Trevor Williams, visiting professor, University of Derby
 I think the bank will either hold rates or cut them. The December MPC minutes explicitly stated that it stands ready to act in “either direction”. Any form of Brexit is damaging relative to the status quo, in my view, so they are more likely to cut rates, and expand QE even as the authorities ease fiscal policy than to raise them. Alastair Winter, chief economist, Daniel Stewart & Company
 It does not seem to matter much any more what the BoE does. One or two 0.25 per cent hikes are likely before year end but base rates at 2 per cent or more still seem years away. The government will need the BoE to keep renewing its gilt holding indefinitely. Garry Young, NIESR
 The Monetary Policy Committee has a clear mandate and operating framework that together are more important than individual changes in interest rates. So long as the MPC is flexible in the way it pursues the inflation target and explains its policy actions clearly then it won’t go far wrong. Linda Yueh, adjunct professor of economics, London Business School
 Monetary policy in 2019 will hinge on how Brexit plays out. The Bank of England has warned that disorderly Brexit will be a “supply” shock which implies that interest rates would have to rise in order to counteract higher inflation even if output is also negatively affected. This is due to their inflation mandate but also because of the nature of supply-side shocks. But, this looks counterintuitive and will put pressure on the bank since the expectation is that the BoE would cut rates just like they did after the EU referendum result. Azad Zangana, senior economist, Schroders
 We expect the bank to raise the main policy interest rate by 0.25 per cent in May, and then again in November, ending the year at 1.25 per cent. There may also be some discussion of ending the reinvestment of maturing bonds under the bank’s quantitative easing programme, but we doubt this will start in 2019. Name withheld
 I do not anticipate a big change, except when there is a hard Brexit with logistics disasters. Would you like to tell us anything else? Ray Barrell, professor, Brunel university
 Who knows what will happen in 2019 (or 2020). The prospects for the UK look much more uncertain than in late 2008. At least there are some outcomes that could be positive, or not too bad, including accepting the deal on offer. Neil Blake, global head of forecasting, CBRE
 A binary outlook. All depends on Brexit. World economic conditions are likely to be challenging in H1. Danny Blanchflower, professor Dartmouth College
 The world economy is slowing again. Brexit looks like a major downside risk. So the balance of risks are strongly to the downside. I can see no upside in 2019. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy, Imperial College
 Even without Brexit there would be strains from change in markets — decline of diesel cars, high street retailing and branch banking etc. There would be employment declines in these areas in any case. The most important Brexit effect is to deter investment in next generation markets — for electric cars, digital economy etc. Brexit will push towards defensive decisions and make it more difficult for companies to take risks. A defensive economy with reduced competitive pressure from EU companies will lead to longer term stagnation at around 1 per cent growth. From 1992 to 2008 economic growth at 3 per cent a year was the highest for 300 years as a result of greater competition and single market. Withdrawal will reverse many of these positive effects. David Cobham, professor, Heriot-Watt University
 I think the extent to which the UK’s public services and UK society have been degraded (for no good reason and with no good purpose) since 2010 is genuinely shocking, and I believe more economists in higher education and in the media should speak out about this more strongly. Bronwyn Curtis, independent economist
 It is time that the UK lost its swagger. It has been losing influence in the world and it is time for a reality check. The UK already has the EU offside and the Commonwealth and/or the US or other countries in Asia are not going to do anything special for the UK. In fact, it is probably just the opposite. They will be happy to take what they can from the UK, but give little in return.  The UK needs to focus on retaining its skilled people and on generating domestic growth rather than have politicians fighting over a shrinking pie.  Paul De Grauwe, professor, LSE
 I did not dare to make predictions. Due to the uncertainties surrounding Brexit, “radical uncertainty” is now so high that any forecast I make today will make me look like a fool in six months time. Panicos Demetriades, professor of financial economics, University of Leicester
 2019 promises to be the most interesting ever year. We could see a reversal of Brexit. Equally likely, perhaps, we could also witness the UK crashing out of the EU as a result of the toxic politics of the two-party system. Happy New Year, whatever happens! Wouter den Haan, LSE
 There was a time that I could imagine some scenarios under which Brexit would be overall beneficial for the UK. That is becoming more difficult. I am also very worried that the inability of our governing bodies to act responsibly and reach a consensus is not just specific to Brexit and may hinder progress in the UK for years to come. Swati Dhingra, LSE
 A disorderly Brexit will likely have worse impacts on young people who are already feeling the pinch of the post-crisis era. Peter Dixon, Commerzbank
 This will clearly be another year dominated by Brexit as the political noise continues to drown out the economics. But we have now wasted the better part of three years on a project that has absorbed a disproportionate amount of policy resources and we are still not coming up with the right answers on a range of policy questions from migration to the funding of prisons to ensuring that the social safety net remains in place. I suspect we will be having the same debates in a year’s time, but the longer we postpone questions of public service provision, the more difficult they will be to fix. Noble Francis, economics director, Construction Products Association
 A few other points spring to mind in various areas that may or may not be of interest/use: 1) In spite of growth in real wages and retail sales, we are expecting the first quarter of 2019 to be very difficult for some traditional high street retailers, as the first quarter of 2018 was. It would not be a surprise to see a few high street names go into administration. 2) In terms of stockpiling, where the focus has been on dealing with “no deal”. Many manufacturers have been stockpiling already but it is not always possible due to a lack of production capacity, a lack of storage space and the rising cost of warehousing space, some materials and products have a limited shelf life and for some products there is an unwillingness to stockpile products that may be needed for later that could be sold globally now. Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, LSE
 The traditional political set-up in the UK with fairly monolithic parties, Conservative and Labour, is under even greater strain than the economy. Can the current political structure stand the strain? What will politics look like by December 2019? Will the young want to emigrate? Mark Gregory, chief economist, EY
 While it is impossible not to be worried about short-term prospects, the real story is what is happening to long-term prospects. The current political and economic uncertainty in the UK and the declining social climate are causing foreign businesses and investors to downgrade their plans for the UK. The base case assumption is clunkier customs, poorer market access and lower migration. The response will be to direct activity and capital to the EU over time, downgrading the UK to a sales and distribution centre. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics
 If Theresa May can get her deal through parliament (we’d put the chances at around 30 per cent), sterling could soar to $1.45. Of course, a “no deal” scenario presents a key downside risk to sterling. If there were some advanced planning, with agreements reached between the UK and EU to keep things flowing, we suspect that the exchange rate would fall to $1.20, roughly where it got to after the Brexit vote. And if the UK crashed out of the EU, we would expect the rate to drop to something like $1.12. But we now think that the chances of a “no deal” Brexit are only about 20 per cent. By contrast, we put the chances of Article 50 being revoked before, or extended beyond, March 29 at 50 per cent, and think it could be positive for sterling. Admittedly, there would be little upside for the currency if uncertainty dragged on, and there might be some downside if there were a snap general election won by Labour, given its anti-business policies. But sterling would probably get a lift from any signs of a softer Brexit and/or a second referendum. Overall, we think that there is more upside, than downside, risk for sterling when we weigh up the potential outcomes that could result from the chaos surrounding the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU. John Hawksworth, PwC
 The UK focus is understandably on Brexit at present, but we should not ignore the downside risks facing the global economy, particularly if we look ahead to 2020-21. The possibility of a hard landing in the US and/or China is a potential concern looking 2-3 years ahead, although we don’t expect more than a gradual slowdown in these economies in 2019.

 In the longer term, every Brexit scenario is likely to increase inflation. If benefits and tax credits are not increased in line with this higher inflation, we will see higher rates of poverty. There will be a temptation for government to respond to Brexit-related fiscal pressures with further reductions in the real level of in and out-of-work benefits. If this happens, it will be those on the lowest incomes to do worst out of our new relationship with the EU. John Llewellyn, Llewellyn Consulting
 The answers to these questions are highly dependent on the Brexit outcome — which at the time of asking is anyone’s guess. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist, Netwealth
 Despite near-term political uncertainty, I remain positive that Brexit will bring longer-term benefits to the economy. To make a success of Brexit the UK needs to get three areas right: our future relationship with the EU; positioning ourselves globally; and our domestic economic and financial agenda. There would be a major constraint on future economic success if our relationship with the EU places constraints upon our global ambitions or our domestic policy, where we need to address the imbalances in the economy and boost investment and infrastructure spending, encourage innovation and have the right policy incentives in place.  David Miles, professor, Imperial College
 Paul Krugman seemed to me right when he said that assessments of the medium and longer-term impact of Brexit on the UK that rested on supposed links between trade arrangements and productivity were not based on anything reliable. It is hard to take seriously a forecast that says one version of Brexit knocks (say) 4 per cent off GDP in the long run while a different version knocks (say) 5 per cent off GDP when we don’t understand much about why UK productivity is close to 20 per cent below the trend it seemed to be following up to the financial crisis. Andrew Mountford, professor, Royal Holloway
 The key issue, which is much analysed in academia, is how nation states can react to the presence of increasingly powerful multinational corporations who are finding ever more ways of avoiding paying taxes on their profits (including influencing the political process). Research suggests that the lost tax revenue is very significant. Without sufficient tax revenues, states will not be able to ensure markets function efficiently (enforcing fair competition, contracts, property rights, regulating monopoly power, investing in public goods such as education, transport infrastructure etc). Thus efficiency and productivity growth will fall. A poorly functioning state is also less able to collect tax revenue and so there is a danger of a self reinforcing process of decline. It must therefore make sense for nation states to co-operate and co-ordinate with each other and agree common rules for taxing and regulating powerful global companies including global banks. The EU’s record on tackling large firms and tax avoidance (diesel scandal, banking crises, climate change, tax havens and tax avoidance) is weak but no weaker than the UK’s. Brexit is clearly moving 180 degrees in the wrong direction. Jacob Nell, chief UK economist, Morgan Stanley
 Pessimistic on potential. We expect reduced EU labour migration to reduce labour force growth, and lower potential growth to 1.3 per cent even after allowing for some recovery in investment and productivity. This more pessimistic estimate — below the 1.5 per cent estimates made by the OBR and BoE — underpins our hawkish view on inflation and rates. Charles Nolan, Glasgow university
 The world economy is providing some notable headwinds, not least political risks to the international trading system. That also exacerbates further the downside risks associated with the UK withdrawal from the EU. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science, Warwick university
 An outside possibility is that there will be some attempt to block Brexit — and that will engender civil disobedience, violence, and looting. Those who say it could not happen in Britain need to remember the remarkable events of August 2011. Social media now make it easier than ever for 10,000 dangerous and disaffected people to congregate on a dark evening. Policing in a democracy is not set up to deal with that kind of phenomenon. I hope never to see such a thing in my nation. Any such trouble would be bad for economic confidence, among other grave problems that might result. David Owen, managing director and chief European economist, Jefferies
 Brexit is the Great Disruptor and, over time, can be expected to lead to a significant change in the economic geography of the EU. Almost whatever happens, events since June 2016 will have caused companies to question their supply chains and to perhaps look beyond the EU for markets and suppliers. For many Brexit will have been a reason to fundamentally question their business model. The harder the Brexit, the more likely this happens, but even the softest Brexit will involve change. Advisory, M&A and financing will follow, along with capital flows. Ann Pettifor, director, Policy Research in Macroeconomics 
 Brexit will happen (assuming it does) within the context of a slowing global economy, weakened by levels of private and public debt higher than before the global financial crisis. The failure to restructure the global economy after the crisis, combined with policy failures means that a crisis of the globally interconnected economy is inevitable. Christopher Pissarides, professor, LSE
 We need more firm action on Brexit. The government should say now that Britain remains in the EU as at present until a free-trade deal is worked out. It will probably be voted down by the Tories but the opposition parties should support it. Jonathan Portes, professor, King’s College London
 Short-term economic forecasts for the UK are currently contingent on short-term political forecasts about Brexit. And as William Goldman (who died a few weeks ago) said, “nobody knows anything”. But, even abstracting from Brexit, the UK economy, like the global economy, is not in great shape. While overall inequality has been relatively stable (although may now be rising), levels of deprivation are a disgrace for a relatively rich, advanced developed economy. By prioritising short-term deficit reduction (in some cases via transparent accounting fiddles, as with the student loans fiasco, now reversed by ONS) over long-term sustainability, the government has left a poisonous legacy for anyone, from whatever party, who wants to be honest with the public about fiscal choices. The flexible labour market (largely a legacy of policy choices from the mid-1980s on) has delivered close to “full employment” but the current model is clearly not sustainable. And we are no closer to working out how to overcome the chronic short-termism of British business and government. Other than that, everything is fine. Happy New Year! Sonali Punhani, Credit Suisse
 On Brexit, our central scenario is that a soft Brexit deal is more likely than the UK exiting without a deal. But the path to a deal is likely to involve further UK domestic political stress. Ricardo Reis, LSE
 It is the end of 2018, and we still don’t know what Britain’s relations with its main trading partner will be in four months’ time. It is hard to make economic forecasts when the overwhelming source of uncertainty is the evolution of domestic politics, which all the political experts on TV say right now could move in radically different ways. Andrew Simms, co-director, New Weather Institute
 Especially in the 10th anniversary of the full-blown financial crash of 2008, we should never again blunder so blindly into a foreseeable crisis. And yet we are doing so, on an even greater scale and with potentially far more dire consequences, in the blind spot we show in not understanding the economy’s absolute dependence on a healthy, functioning biosphere. Late in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its much awaited report on how to meet the international target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade. Its scientific conclusion was that to prevent such climate breakdown would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”.  In response, and ironically to coincide with the launch of the government’s own “Green GB Week”, official backing for fracking for fossil fuels was given the green light, plans were announced for a huge new road in the south-east, incentives for electric vehicles withered, while the expansion of Heathrow airport remains a priority and it emerged that Gatwick airport is trying to expand too by bringing a back-up runway into use. Something fundamental is wrong. Elsewhere, the head of the oil company Shell responded to the new climate science by stating that “Shell’s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas”. Separately, BP announced new North Sea oil projects.  Economic choices are being made, both public and private, that will have the effect of accelerating a catastrophic climate breakdown, when we should be aggressively pursuing innovation to transform the economy to thrive within planetary ecological boundaries. In spite of the publication in 2017 of the UK’s first explicit industrial strategy in ages, subtitled “building a Britain fit for the future”, and an update in 2018 focused on the “grand challenges” which included the pledge to lead the world “in the development, manufacture and use of low carbon technologies”, the government has acted with an almost single minded purpose to undermine and disable the green energy technology sectors. In terms of long-term consequences for humanity, rather than just Britain’s place in Europe, the Brexit deadline, while critical, is trifling in comparison with the deadline to act to prevent climate breakdown.  What would action look like that might even begin to create the conditions for the rapid economic transition we need? Fifty years ago the world acted swiftly to agree a nuclear non proliferation treaty. In December 2018, the former US Defense Secretary, William Perry, said that the climate threat compares to nuclear war.  I recently proposed with my colleague Prof Peter Newell, that we now needed an equivalent Fossil Fuel Non Proliferation Treaty, to draw a line in the sand on any further expansion of fossil fuel energy and its dependent infrastructure. The City of London remains a major centre of fossil fuel financing and such a change in direction would do more to redirect energy to vital and productive innovation to “future proof” the UK than anything else. Rather than creating self-imposed shocks like Brexit, or waiting for the next extreme weather event to hit, we should be learning from our proven ability to bring about successful, rapid transitions in a wide range of circumstances and planning ahead.  Anybody interested in learning such lessons, and contributing their own ideas to them, can look at the new Rapid Transition Alliance initiative — that a range of forward looking organisations, including my own, have set up to do so. It provides some evidence-based hope in a warming world, not to mention a country sinking in Brexit-driven confusion. Nina Skero, director and head of macroeconomics, CEBR
 The biggest negative economic factor from Brexit could be the loss of talented people. Britain will need to ensure that whatever happens, employers still have access to a pool of talent without excessive immigration bureaucracy and costs. Andrew Smithers, author
 The Brexit debate has drowned out the UK’s real problem which is that companies are investing too little due to the perverse incentives on management arising from the bonus culture. I am sorry that the FT continues to ignore this issue. Gary Styles, director, GPS Economics
 2018 has been an extraordinary year. Perhaps 2019 will also surprise us all and we will get a clear parliamentary vote for a European deal the vast majority of the country can support. The economy, markets and the public need a speedy resolution regardless of the final deal. Suren Thiru, head of economics and business finance, British Chambers of Commerce
 The downside risks to the UK’s economic outlook remain uncomfortably high. A disorderly departure from the EU would likely deliver a significant negative shock to the UK economy, materially weakening the near-term growth and productive potential. On the upside, greater clarity and precision over the UK’s future relationship with the EU and with other key markets should help drive an upturn in economic conditions, including stronger investment intentions. John Van Reenen, professor, MIT economics department and Sloan management school
 Here’s my take on the best course of action for parliament and the country to take: “Britain deserves a second chance”. Peter Westaway, chief economist, Vanguard Asset Management
 It is important not to forget that the UK economy will continue to be affected by all the usual factors that would affect a smallish open economy at this stage of the cycle. As such, even though a global recession is not our main case prediction, the chances of a slowdown caused by a sharp market correction, intensifying trade wars, a China slowdown or increased stresses in European sovereign markets are all present. At some point, policymakers and market investors in the UK will need to re-focus their attention on business as usual matters. But without doubt, if Brexit does go ahead, that is likely to be the predominant negative influence on economic prospects in the UK for some years to come. Mike Wickens, professor, University of York
 Despite the incessant articles in the FT to the contrary, Brexit has never been about the economy. I wish that the FT would realise that it is mainly about the politics of being in a system that is moving as fast as it can towards political integration and so give its readers some analysis of this — even though it is two years too late. Trevor Williams, visiting professor, University of Derby
 Financial markets will face further turmoil, with equities lower. The yield curve is likely to flatten and short and long-term rates fall. An inverted tied curve cannot be ruled out. For sure, the housing market will soften further — with transactions volumes lower and prices sagging, especially in London and high immigration areas, as demand softens and domestic buyers feel the squeeze from rising unaffordability. The weakness of M4 money supply growth does not bode well for growth. As such, the conditions for a slide in the currency towards $1.20 against the US dollar is very possible. Alastair Winter, chief economist, Daniel Stewart & Company
 The above answers are in the context of slowing global growth, particularly in China and less markedly in the US. Getting Brexit out of the way should help the UK and other Northern European economies. Equity markets are unlikely either to prosper or to crash and the FTSE 350 should fare better than most. Sterling is likely to appreciate across the board in 2019 perhaps reaching $1.50 and €1.20. Linda Yueh, adjunct professor of economics, London Business School
 The US-China trade war is likely to rumble on through the first quarter of the year, so that will also increase import price pressures in the UK and potentially deter big M&A deals. The US and China as well as the EU has to approve merger and acquisition deals. By not acting, China’s antitrust authority scuppered US tech company Qualcomm’s $44bn bid to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP. China says they’re open to approving it now as part of the trade discussions with the US, but Qualcomm has paid NXP a $2bn break-up fee and said the deal won’t be revived. This high profile casualty of the trade war won’t go unnoticed among multinational companies. Garry Young, NIESR
