"'Lose-lose situation': New Swiss bank laws could derail UBS' challenge to Wall Street giants","In a 209-page plan published Wednesday, the Swiss government proposed 22 measures aimed at tightening its policing of banks deemed ""too big to fail,"" a year after authorities were forced to broker the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS.The UBS balance sheet of around $1.7 trillion is now double Switzerland's annual GDP, prompting enhanced scrutiny of the protections around the Swiss banking sector and the broader economy.","Switzerland's tough new banking regulations create a ""lose-lose situation"" for UBS and may limit its potential to challenge Wall Street giants, according to Beat Wittmann, partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors. In a 209-page plan published Wednesday, the Swiss government proposed 22 measures aimed at tightening its policing of banks deemed ""too big to fail,"" a year after authorities were forced to broker the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS. The government-backed takeover was the biggest merger of two systemically important banks since the Global Financial Crisis. At $1.7 trillion, the UBS balance sheet is now double the country's annual GDP, prompting enhanced scrutiny of the protections surrounding the Swiss banking sector and the broader economy in the wake of the Credit Suisse collapse. Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday, Wittmann said that the fall of Credit Suisse was ""an entirely self-inflicted and predictable failure of government policy, central bank, regulator, and above all [of the] finance minister."" ""Then of course Credit Suisse had a failed, unsustainable business model and an incompetent leadership, and it was all indicated by an ever-falling share price and by the credit spreads throughout [20]22, [which was] completely ignored because there is no institutionalized know-how at the policymaker levels, really, to watch capital markets, which is essential in the case of the banking sector,"" he added. The Wednesday report floated giving additional powers to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, applying capital surcharges and fortifying the financial position of subsidiaries — but stopped short of recommending a ""blanket increase"" in capital requirements. Wittman suggested the report does nothing to assuage concerns about the ability of politicians and regulators to oversee banks while ensuring their global competitiveness, saying it ""creates a lose-lose situation for Switzerland as a financial center and for UBS not to be able to develop its potential."" He argued that regulatory reform should be prioritized over tightening the screws on the country's largest banks, if UBS is to capitalize on its newfound scale and finally challenge the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley — which have similarly sized balance sheets, but trade at s much higher valuation. ""It comes down to the regulatory level playing field. It's about competences of course and then about the incentives and the regulatory framework, and the regulatory framework like capital requirements is a global level exercise,"" Wittmann said. ""It cannot be that Switzerland or any other jurisdiction is imposing very, very different rules and levels there — that doesn't make any sense, then you cannot really compete."" In order for UBS to optimize its potential, Wittmann argued that the Swiss regulatory regime should come into line with that in Frankfurt, London and New York, but said that the Wednesday report showed ""no will to engage in any relevant reforms"" that would protect the Swiss economy and taxpayers, but enable UBS to ""catch up to global players and U.S. valuations."" ""The track record of the policymakers in Switzerland is that we had three global systemically relevant banks, and we have now one left, and these cases were the direct result of insufficient regulation and the enforcement of the regulation,"" he said. ""FINMA had all the legal backdrop, the instruments in place to address the situation but they didn't apply it — that's the point — and now we talk about fines, and that sounds like pennywise and pound foolish to me.""",2024-04-11,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/11/lose-lose-situation-new-swiss-bank-laws-could-derail-ubs-challenge-to-wall-street-giants.html?&qsearchterm="
"Swiss banking giant UBS to launch share buyback of up to $2 billion","""Our ambition is for share repurchases to exceed our pre-acquisition level by 2026,"" it said.The new program comes after the completion of the 2022 buyback, which saw 298.5 million of it shares purchased. ","UBS on Tuesday announced a new share repurchase program of up to $2 billion, with up to $1 billion of that total expected to take place this year. ""As previously communicated, in 2024 we expect to repurchase up to USD 1bn of our shares, commencing after the completion of the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG which is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Our ambition is for share repurchases to exceed our pre-acquisition level by 2026."" The new program follows the completion of the 2022 buyback, during which 298.5 million of it shares were purchased. This represented 8.62% of its stock worth $5.2 billion, according to UBS. The bank's 2022 share repurchase program concluded last month.  Buybacks take place when firms purchase their own shares on the stock exchange, reducing the portion of shares in the hands of investors. They offer a way for companies to return cash to shareholders — along with dividends — and usually coincide with a company's stock moving higher, as shares get scarcer. UBS has undertaken the mammoth task of integrating Credit Suisse's business, after announcing in late March 2023 that former chief Sergio Ermotti would return for a second spell as CEO. Figures last week showed that Ermotti earned 14.4 million Swiss francs ($15.9 million) in 2023, following his surprise return. The bank in February reported a second consecutive quarterly loss on the back of integration costs, but continued to deliver strong underlying operating profits.

""It's going to be a case study to be evaluated globally, but also particularly in Europe, where eventually the necessity of creating stronger banks, and stronger and more competitive banks from a global standpoint of view, is in my point of view a necessity,"" Ermotti told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at an event at the Ambrosetti Spring Forum in Italy. ""Of course, we can't just rely on a crisis to create or facilitate the merger of banks,"" Ermotti said. ""It's good to have strong players that can be part of the solution, like UBS was in the Credit Suisse case. ... But it cannot be just that part. So in that sense, I think that the real issue is, there has to be a political desire to facilitate something like that. So it's not the reality of today,"" he added.

Ermotti said Friday, ""The good news is that, in my view, in many countries, there is a recognition that they want to protect their banks or financial institutions as national champions, which is an implied or explicit recognition of their value for their economies."" ""But the bad news is that they don't realize that in order to really be meaningful, and go to the next level of their contribution in their economies, they will need to be also more competitive globally. But without a banking union, without a capital markets union, it's going to be very, very difficult for Europe to compete with U.S. large banks."" Unlike in the U.S., European economies continue to rely on the banking sector for business financing; and Europe has a ""completely different playing field and a lack of critical mass,"" Ermotti said. ""So I hope, I'm not so convinced it's going to happen soon, but I hope eventually one day those kinds of mergers between big banks will be allowed and we can contribute to that by showing that it's possible.

For the fourth quarter, that came in at $592 million.","Swiss banking giant UBS on Tuesday narrowly beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations and announced that it would recommence share buybacks worth up to $1 billion in the second half of the year. The group posted a net loss attributable to shareholders of $279 million for the quarter, its second consecutive loss due to the costs of integrating fallen rival Credit Suisse. However, analysts polled by LSEG had expected a wider net loss of $372 million. Along with the share buybacks, UBS plans to propose a dividend per share of $0.70, up 27% year-on-year. In the third quarter, UBS had posted a bigger-than-expected net loss attributable to shareholders of $785 million — which factored in $2 billion in expenses related to the integration of fallen rival Credit Suisse. After that third quarter report, the market chose to focus on the bank's strong underlying operating profit before tax, which was well ahead of expectations. For the fourth quarter, that came in at $592 million, below a company-compiled consensus of $762 million. ""I'm very pleased that, on an underlying basis, we saw actually good profitability, and we saw also good momentum with clients. We had $22 billion of inflows in net new assets and also saw very good inflows in deposits across both wealth management and the P&C (personal and corporate banking), we have managed down exposure in non-core and legacy,"" UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC on Tuesday. ""We also made further improvements in our targets to deliver cost savings by achieving a $4 billion exit rate in cost savings in 2023, so all that contributed to good results, and this gives us the confidence to now tackle the next phase of our restructuring and integration."" UBS has so far reported a quicker than expected return of client inflows to Credit Suisse's wealth management business since the takeover, which it completed in June 2023. The integration of its stricken rival continues, with UBS embarking on a process of cutting around 3,000 Credit Suisse jobs as part of the wider restructure. UBS announced on Tuesday that it had completed the first phase of the strategic integration, and that the full merger is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. Here are some other highlights: Ermotti told CNBC's Silvia Amaro on Tuesday that delays are the biggest risk to the Credit Suisse integration, given the tight targets UBS has set for itself. ""2024 is a pivotal year in that sense, because we are merging in the first half of the year our two parent companies, we are merging the U.S. operation, we are merging the Swiss operations, and this will allow us then to start to realize the synergies,"" Ermotti said. ""The IT migration is the second major potential problem but we have a very concrete plan. If you think about it, we have 6,000 deliverable tasks that we need to execute, so we are planning very carefully and also in a way that doesn't create concentration risk in the execution."" UBS shares have made an indifferent start to 2024, and were down 3.3% in early trade on Tuesday. Given the various costs associated with the integration, the market will look past the headline figures in UBS earnings and focus on more fundamental indicators for the next few years, according to Morningstar Equity Analyst Johann Scholtz. ""UBS has guided that they are looking only towards 2027 before we are really going to arrive at the situation where all of the accounting noise will be out of the results, but I think there are some other numbers that we can look at that give us a good indication of the underlying health of the business,"" Scholtz told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Tuesday. He suggested the key number to focus on is net new money growth in the wealth management division, particularly the Credit Suisse legacy portion of that business. ""The reason why net new money is really that important is because assets under management obviously includes market movement, so it really gives you a good indication of whether the combined entity manages to hold onto clients, and even possibly gain back some of the clients that Credit Suisse lost in its wealth management division due to concerns about the health of the Credit Suisse business,"" Scholtz explained. ""It's also important to take note that the Credit Suisse portion of the wealth management business has actually been close to a breakeven, slightly loss-making position, so it's really vital for that division that it gets some new assets under management to improve its fee income and return to profitability.""",2024-02-06,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/ubs-beats-earnings-expectations-announces-up-to-1-billion-share-buyback.html?&qsearchterm="

UBS completed its takeover of Credit Suisse in June 2023 after an emergency rescue deal was brokered by Swiss authorities to prevent the then 167-year-old institution's collapse and protect the Swiss economy. Ermotti was brought back to the helm of UBS to oversee the complex integration of Credit Suisse's business — a mission thus far deemed a resounding success by the market. The bank's share price has recovered from below 17 Swiss francs ($19.69) per share in the aftermath of the deal to over 25 Swiss francs as of Wednesday morning. However, the new entity's combined balance sheet is estimated to be around twice the size of the entire GDP of Switzerland, raising concerns about the concentration of risk in the Swiss economy. Speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Ermotti said he understood why some portions of the Swiss population still have reservations, as they are being ""indoctrinated almost daily by a lot of academics"" and focusing solely on the size of the bank's balance sheet versus the national GDP. ""If you look at risk-weighted assets as a percentage of GDP or as a percentage of our balance sheet, you will discover that the new UBS is de facto very low risk, very focused business model. The risk we have is in Swiss mortgages, in Lombard loans, in stuff that is very low risk,"" he said. Ermotti contended that the ""new UBS"" incorporating its fallen rival to create a globally competitive, low-risk bank is a ""reflection of Switzerland."" ""Switzerland is a small country that punches well above its weight in many sectors — in food, in pharma, in innovation — and having a strong bank that can compete, not only in Europe, but globally, is part of our economy,"" he said. He also argued that the focus on the risk to the Swiss taxpayer fails to take into account the scale of the bank's own tax contributions, urging the public to ""look at the risks but also the benefits."" ""In that sense, our role is to help the people who are not convinced, that want to listen to arguments, to inform them so that they come to an opinion that is informed, hopefully the right one.

"UBS sees a 10% spike for gold this year as rate cut speculation swirls","Gold prices have slipped from a year-end rally so far in 2024 — but the ""power of the Fed's policy pivot should not be underestimated,"" according to UBS. Cooling interest rate expectations have contributed to recent weakness. Analysts at Scotiabank on Monday lifted their 2024 forecast for gold. ","Gold prices could close the year as much as 10% above current levels on the back of potential interest rate cuts, UBS strategists said, despite declines at the start of 2024. A UBS note on Friday described recent price moves as ""minor"" in the context of the precious metal's 15% climb through 2023 and said the ""power of the [Federal Reserve]'s policy pivot should not be underestimated."" Bullion remains above the psychological level of $2,000 per ounce, the UBS strategists said, forecasting a rise to $2,250 per ounce by the end of the year, despite near-time volatility. Analysts at Scotiabank retained a more cautious outlook, but revised their price guidance higher. In a Monday note, they said they had adopted higher gold and silver prices for this and next year, and moved their year-end gold forecast to $2,000 per ounce, from $1,900 per ounce, previously. Gold prices can be impacted by factors including geopolitical instability and market uncertainty — which can boost the appeal of bullion as a ""safe haven"" asset — and interest rates, which can make higher-yielding investments more attractive when they are raised. Markets are increasingly uncertain that the Fed will begin interest rate cuts in March. Current pricing drops the probability at around 48%, according to CME's FedWatch tool, down from as high as 81% just over a week ago. That's with two key releases on U.S. fourth-quarter economic growth and the personal consumption expenditures price index still to come this week. Investors are also monitoring coming monetary policy meetings at the Bank of Japan on Tuesday and European Central Bank on Thursday. Gold hit several record highs late last year and notched a record close of $2,078 per ounce, according to the World Gold Council. Analysts tied the rise to interest rate expectations and the global volatility stemming from the Israel-Hamas conflict. Spot gold was down 0.26% to $2,024 at 1 p.m. London time on Monday. Central banks have also been a major buyer of gold in 2022 and 2023, as they diversify their reserves. That is on the back of an expectation for 100 basis points of Fed cuts, beginning in May, ""putting pressure on the US dollar and real interest rates, which should spark fresh demand, particularly from exchange-traded gold funds,"" according to the UBS note.

"UBS sees a raft of Fed rate cuts next year on the back of a U.S. recession","UBS sees slower growth, rising unemployment and disinflation to lead the Fed to cut its benchmark rate to a target range ending the year between 2.50% and 2.75%.Arend Kapteyn, UBS global head of economics and strategy research, told CNBC on Tuesday that the starting conditions are ""much worse now than 12 months ago,"" particularly in the form of the ""historically large"" amount of credit that is being withdrawn from the U.S. economy.","UBS expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by as much as 275 basis points in 2024, almost four times the market consensus, as the world's largest economy tips into recession. In its 2024-2026 outlook for the U.S. economy, published Monday, the Swiss bank said despite economic resilience through 2023, many of the same headwinds and risks remain. Meanwhile, the bank's economists suggested that ""fewer of the supports for growth that enabled 2023 to overcome those obstacles will continue in 2024."" UBS expects disinflation and rising unemployment to weaken economic output in 2024, leading the Federal Open Market Committee to cut rates ""first to prevent the nominal funds rate from becoming increasingly restrictive as inflation falls, and later in the year to stem the economic weakening."" Between March 2022 and July 2023, the FOMC enacted a run of 11 rate hikes to take the fed funds rate from a target range of 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.5%. The central bank has since held at that level, prompting markets to mostly conclude that rates have peaked, and to begin speculating on the timing and scale of future cuts. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that he was ""not confident"" the FOMC had yet done enough to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target. UBS noted that despite the most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s, real GDP expanded by 2.9% over the year to the end of the third quarter. However, yields have risen and stock markets have come under pressure since the September FOMC meeting. The bank believes this has renewed growth concerns and shows the economy is ""not out of the woods yet."" ""The expansion bears the increasing weight of higher interest rates. Credit and lending standards appear to be tightening beyond simply repricing. Labor market income keeps being revised lower, on net, over time,"" UBS highlighted. ""According to our estimates, spending in the economy looks elevated relative to income, pushed up by fiscal stimulus and maintained at that level by excess savings."" The bank estimates that the upward pressure on growth from fiscal impetus in 2023 will fade next year, while household savings are ""thinning out"" and balance sheets look less robust. ""Furthermore, if the economy does not slow substantially, we doubt the FOMC restores price stability. 2023 outperformed because many of these risks failed to materialize. However, that does not mean they have been eliminated,"" UBS said. ""In our view, the private sector looks less insulated from the FOMC's rate hikes next year. Looking ahead, we expect substantially slower growth in 2024, a rising unemployment rate, and meaningful reductions in the federal funds rate, with the target range ending the year between 2.50% and 2.75%."" UBS expects the economy to contract by half a percentage point in the middle of next year, with annual GDP growth dropping to just 0.3% in 2024 and unemployment rising to nearly 5% by the end of the year. ""With that added disinflationary impulse, we expect monetary policy easing next year to drive recovery in 2025, pushing GDP growth back up to roughly 2-1/2%, limiting the peak in the unemployment rate to 5.2% in early 2025. We forecast some slowing in 2026, in part due to projected fiscal consolidation,"" the bank's economists said. Arend Kapteyn, UBS global head of economics and strategy research, told CNBC on Tuesday that the starting conditions are ""much worse now than 12 months ago,"" particularly in the form of the ""historically large"" amount of credit that is being withdrawn from the U.S. economy. ""The credit impulse is now at its worst level since the global financial crisis — we think we're seeing that in the data. You've got margin compression in the U.S. which is a good precursor to layoffs, so U.S. margins are under more pressure for the economy as a whole than in Europe, for instance, which is surprising,"" he told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on the sidelines of the UBS European Conference. Meanwhile, private payrolls ex-health care are growing at close to zero and some of the 2023 fiscal stimulus is rolling off, Kapteyn noted, also reiterating the ""massive gap"" between real incomes and spending that means there is ""much more scope for that spending to fall down towards those income levels."" ""The counter that people then have is they say 'well why are income levels not going up, because inflation is falling, real disposable incomes should be improving?' But in the U.S., debt service for households is now increasing faster than real income growth, so we basically think there is enough there to have a few negative quarters mid-next year,"" Kapteyn argued. A recession is characterized in many economies as two consecutive quarters of contraction in real GDP. In the U.S., the National Bureau of Economic Research Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."" This takes into account a holistic assessment of the labor market, consumer and business spending, industrial production, and incomes. The UBS outlook on both rates and growth is well below the market consensus. Goldman Sachs projects the U.S. economy will expand by 2.1% in 2024, outpacing other developed markets. Kamakshya Trivedi, head of global FX, rates and EM strategy at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Monday that the Wall Street giant was ""pretty confident"" in the U.S. growth outlook. ""Real income growth looks to be pretty firm and we think that will continue to be the case. The global industrial cycle which was going through a pretty soft patch this year, we think, is showing some signs of bottoming out, including in parts of Asia, so we feel pretty confident about that,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" Trivedi added that with inflation returning gradually to target, monetary policy may become a bit more accommodative, pointing to some recent dovish comments from Fed officials. ""I think that combination of things — the lessening drag from policy, stronger industrial cycle and real income growth — makes us pretty confident that the Fed can stay on hold at this plateau,"" he concluded. Correction: Between March 2022 and July 2023, the FOMC enacted a run of 11 rate hikes to take the fed funds rate from a target range of 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.5%.

The bank recorded an underlying operating profit before tax of $844 million, well ahead of consensus expectations. UBS shares were up 3.2% by mid-afternoon in Europe. Factoring in $2 billion in expenses related to the integration of fallen rival Credit Suisse, UBS posted a bigger-than-expected third-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders of $785 million.

They both grew on a quarter-on-quarter basis,"" UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC on Tuesday. ""The IB [investment bank] has been facing more challenging market conditions, particularly when you look at our business model and the fact that we have been onboarding resources from Credit Suisse. But it was a very solid quarter, and we made very good progress in our integration plans, and at the same time we saw very strong inflows from clients."" Analysts at Citi highlighted on Tuesday that the $844 million underlying profit before tax figure was ""notably ahead of prior company guidance (of break-even), treble consensus expectations and 6% ahead of our above-consensus forecast."" ""As we expected the beat is driven by better opex [operating expense], 7% below consensus, with revenues also 1% ahead. This is then slightly offset by heavier provisions,"" they noted, adding that the acceleration of Wealth Management net new money inflows in September was also ""encouraging."" Citi concluded that Tuesday's report was ""overall a good set of results"" and reiterated its Buy/High Risk rating. UBS completed its takeover of its stricken domestic rival in June and announced in August that it had ended a 9 billion Swiss franc loss protection agreement and a 100 billion Swiss franc public liquidity backstop that were put in place when the emergency rescue was agreed in March. The bank's shares soared to their highest point since late 2008 in August after its second quarter earnings results reported a $28.88 billion net profit as a result of negative goodwill on the Credit Suisse acquisition. Negative goodwill represents the fair value of assets acquired in a merger over and above the purchase price. UBS paid a discounted 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.33 billion) to acquire Credit Suisse in March, in a deal mediated by Swiss authorities to prevent the collapse of the storied but scandal-plagued lender. The stock price has since moderated slightly, but remains up more than 27% on the year. UBS is also in the process of fully integrating Credit Suisse's Swiss banking unit — a key profit center — and is expected to cut a hefty proportion of the legacy bank's workforce. UBS reported net new deposits of $33 billion across its Global Wealth Management and Personal and Corporate Banking (P&C) divisions, with $22 billion coming from Credit Suisse clients and positive deposit inflows for P&C in September, the month after UBS announced the decision to integrate the domestic bank. The bank also announced earlier this year that it is targeting gross cost savings of at least $10 billion by 2026, when it hopes to have completed the integration all of Credit Suisse Group's businesses.",2023-11-07,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/07/ubs-q3-2023-earnings.html?&qsearchterm="

U.S. credit card debt soared to $1.08 trillion in the third quarter of 2023, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed earlier this month. This has sparked concerns about what rising debt levels, brought on at least in parts by higher prices, could mean for the overall economy. However, Pingle told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Wednesday that it is difficult to view the data as a systemic risk. ""I don't think we're facing the next GFC [global financial crisis],"" he said on the sidelines of the UBS European Conference. Credit tightening does play a role when it comes to the lag of Federal Reserve monetary policy filtering through to the economy, Pingle suggested. ""We are still waiting to see those credit headwinds dampen activity in 2024,"" he said. Credit tightening tends to precede loan growth by several quarters, so the full impact is not yet clear, he explained. Several other factors also come into play, Pingle noted. This includes concerns about regulation in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which raised alarms about the health and stability of the banking sector and prompted a crisis in regional banking, and ""rapid"" interest rate hikes, he said. The Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in March 2022 in an effort to ease inflation and cool the economy. Eleven rate hikes have been implemented since then, with the target range for the fed funds rate rising from 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.5%. The Fed chose to leave rates unchanged at both of its last two meetings, and Tuesday's lower-than-expected reading of the October consumer price index prompted traders to all but erase the chances of rates being hiked at the central bank's December meeting. The CPI was flat compared to September and reflected a 3.2% rise on an annual basis, while the so-called core-CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 4% year over year. This marked the smallest rise since September 2021. ""It's great news for the Federal Reserve in their quest to restore price stability,"" Pingle told CNBC on Wednesday. Still, they are ""not out of the woods yet"" he added, saying that there was ""still a ways to go"" before the Fed reached its 2% inflation goal. A trend of disinflation is however in place, Pingle said, and if the Fed can slow the economy, it could make strong progress toward its inflation goal. ""We think its probably going to get to 2 next year. It's already falling faster than the Fed expects,"" he said. However the economy including the labor market will have to weaken further for inflation to steadily remain around 2%, Pingle expects. ""The path to two and a half we think is pretty clear, but sort of that last leg down we do think is going to take some weakening in the labor market,"" he said. In its 2024-2026 outlook for the U.S. economy, which was published Monday, UBS said it expected unemployment to rise close to 5% next year and for the economy to enter a mild recession. UBS is anticipating a contraction of the economy by around half a percentage point in mid-2024, its report suggested. A looming recession has been a key fear among investors throughout the Fed's rate-hiking cycle as many have been concerned about rates being hiked too high, too quickly. They have therefore been hoping for an imminent end to rate hikes and hints about when the Fed may start cutting rates again. UBS foresees significant rate cuts for 2024, predicting that rates could be cut by as many as 275 basis points throughout the year. Rates would be cut ""first to prevent the nominal funds rate from becoming increasingly restrictive as inflation falls, and later in the year to stem the economic weakening,"" the Swiss bank said. Rate cuts will therefore be a two-step process Pingle explained, and could start relatively early in the year. ""As early as March they should probably start at least calibrating the nominal funds rate,"" he said, whereas the second stage would likely begin when unemployment starts rising.  ",2023-11-15,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/15/next-global-financial-crisis-is-not-ahead-ubs-us-chief-economist.html?&qsearchterm="

The Swiss banking giant is marketing two tranches of U.S. dollar AT1 bonds, a noncall five-year offering around a 10% yield and a noncall 10-year offering around 10.125%, according to LSEG news service IFR. Noncall bonds are bonds that only pay out at maturity. UBS confirmed to CNBC that it is offering Additional Tier 1 securities, but did not comment on the details of the contracts and said it will provide additional information when the offering is complete. The wipeout of $17 billion of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds, as part of the rescue deal brokered by Swiss authorities in March, caused uproar among bondholders and continues to saddle the Swiss government and regulator with legal challenges. AT1 bonds are considered a relatively risky form of junior debt and are often owned by institutional investors. They were introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as regulators looked to divert risk away from taxpayers and boost the capital held by financial institutions to protect against future crises. Fitch on Wednesday assigned the new AT1 notes a BBB rating, four notches below UBS Group's overall viability rating of A, with two notches for ""loss severity given the notes' deep subordination"" and two for ""incremental non-performance risk."" ""UBS's new AT1 notes will contain a permanent write-down mechanism at issue.

The report marked a significant improvement on the pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022.  ""By next spring, inflation will have slowed to a comfortable level for both the Fed and investors,"" said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer of the Americas for UBS Wealth Management.

"'The bond vigilante is coming back,' UBS strategist says","The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose above 5% once again on Monday, having passed the milestone on Thursday for the first time since 2007.Yields move inversely to prices.The U.S. federal government ended its fiscal year in September with a budget deficit of almost $1.7 trillion, the Treasury Department announced Friday.","The bond vigilantes are coming back as investors continue to sell amid the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates and a growing fiscal deficit, according to Kevin Zhao, head of global sovereign and currency at UBS Asset Management. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose above 5% once again on Monday, having passed the milestone on Thursday for the first time since 2007. Yields move inversely to prices. The further selling came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed to remain resolute in keeping monetary policy tight as the central bank looks to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target, while investors are also pricing in surprising economic resilience alongside fiscal slippage. The U.S. federal government ended its fiscal year in September with a budget deficit of almost $1.7 trillion, the Treasury Department announced Friday, adding to a huge national debt totaling $33.6 trillion. The country's debt has swelled by more than $10 trillion since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, prompting a deluge of fiscal stimulus to help prop up the economy. Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday, Zhao highlighted the historic bond market sell-off that greeted former British Prime Minister Liz Truss' disastrous ""mini-budget"" last September — which included a raft of unfunded tax cuts — as an example of bond investors lashing out against what they deem to be irresponsible fiscal policy. ""The bond vigilante is coming back, so this is very important for asset prices in equity, house prices, fiscal policy, monetary policy, so no longer is this a free ride on bond markets anymore — so the government has to be very careful in terms of the future. You saw that last September, you saw that in Treasurys,"" Zhao said. ""A few months ago, most people expected the U.S. government deficit would keep going down with growth slowing — it was 3.9% last year and it's actually going up with growth slowing — that is quite alarming for bond investors."" The term ""bond vigilantes"" refers to bond market investors who protest against monetary or fiscal policy they fear is inflationary by selling bonds, thereby increasing yields. Meanwhile markets are assessing the potential for interest rates to stay higher for longer as the Fed continues to try to rein in sticky inflation. U.S. inflation has retreated significantly from its June 2022 peak of 9.1% year on year, but still came in above expectations in September at 3.7%. Before holding off on hiking in September, the U.S. Federal Reserve had lifted its main policy rate from a target range of 0.25%-0.5% in March 2022 to 5.25%-5.5% in July 2023. Fed fund futures pricing reflects a 98% probability that the central bank keeps its main interest rate unchanged at the current target range of 5.25%-5.5% at its next monetary policy meeting. Zhao's comments echo the sentiment voiced by several strategists stateside in recent weeks. Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni told CNBC earlier this month that bond vigilantes had been ""asleep for a long time"" because inflation was persistently low from the 2008 financial crisis through to the Covid-19 pandemic, but had now awoken again as inflation soared in the aftermath of the pandemic. ""During the pandemic environment we saw basically an experiment in Modern Monetary Theory, helicopter money, money kind of raining down on people's deposits and that was accommodated by easy monetary policy — well monetary policy has reversed course and has tightened, meanwhile, fiscal policy has gone the other way and has been way too stimulative, and the bond vigilantes are being vigilant again about fiscal policy,"" Yardeni said. ""They're basically saying 'cut this deficit substantially or we're going to raise rates to levels that are going to clobber the economy, and then what are you going to do?'"" The 10-year yield is widely seen as a proxy for mortgage rates and a gauge of investor sentiment about the strength of the economy, since a rising yield implies a fall in demand for traditional ""safe haven"" Treasury bonds, signaling investors are comfortable opting for higher-risk investments.

The group posted second-quarter net profit of $28.88 billion on Thursday as a result of $28.93 billion in negative goodwill from its acquisition of stricken rival Credit Suisse, which was brokered by Swiss authorities in March and completed on June 12. UBS also announced that it will fully integrate Credit Suisse's Swiss banking unit, a key profit center, in 2024. This will result in 1,000 redundancies on top of a further 2,000 reduction in head count across the group as part of a mass restructure of the rescued lender. UBS shares were up 5.6% by midafternoon in Zurich on Thursday, touching levels not seen since late 2008. Notably, UBS highlighted that the massive net asset and deposit outflows seen by Credit Suisse over the last year have finally begun to reverse, and turned positive in June. Meanwhile, UBS' CET1 ratio, a measure of bank solvency, nudged up to 14.4% from 14.2% in the same period last year, despite the disruption of one of the largest mergers in banking history. ""The underlying UBS business is seemingly not impacted by the deal. Non-Core is significant but made solid progress and the CET1 ratio was strong/ahead of expectations in 2Q23,"" Deutsche Bank analysts Benjamin Goy and Sharath Kumar said in a research note Thursday. ""Clearly the group remains a construction site in the near term, however we believe this set of results and announcements should give confidence in the mid-term bull case, Buy."" This bullishness was echoed by Bruno Verstraete, partner at Zurich-based Lakefield Partners, who told CNBC that Thursday's result was a ""once in a blue moon, historic number."" ""Clearly the good news is indeed that stabilization came and that the market seems to de-risk what was out there and what was potentially something which still had some hidden dead bodies in the cupboard,"" he said, referring to the Credit Suisse's troubled history of legacy compliance and oversight failures. ""That seems not to be the case now, that seems to be under control, and I think investors are really reacting positively to that."" Earlier this month, UBS announced that it had ended a 9 billion Swiss franc ($10.24 billion) loss protection agreement and a 100 billion franc public liquidity backstop that were put in place by the Swiss government when it agreed to take over Credit Suisse in March. Verstraete suggested that severing any financial dependence on the Swiss government and central bank had freed up UBS to take the decision on absorbing Credit Suisse's domestic banking unit without being subject to any political pressure. The prospect of further mass layoffs may be unpopular among some portions of the political and public sphere in Switzerland. ""It's difficult to combine a blowout result like that and then to announce layoffs at the same time. I think there will be different ways of layoffs in order to get to that integration and into the cost-cutting opportunity that is there. That's clearly positive for the investors,"" Verstraete said. However, he argued that it is in the interests of the Swiss public to have a ""solid bank."" ""One third of Switzerland is banking with the group, combined. They want to have a stable group, they don't want to have a mastodon created that is too big to save. I think this de-risking, this going from a risk culture to another one is something that is clearly going to be beneficial for the general public in the end,"" Verstraete added. UBS on Thursday announced plans to further wind down noncore units of Credit Suisse's ailing investment bank, wealth management and asset management divisions, which it said are ""not aligned with our strategy and policies."" Gildas Surry, senior analyst at Paris-based Axiom Alternative Investments, told CNBC on Thursday that the market will be closely watching UBS' efforts to wind down these noncore divisions, and seeking further guidance on the future of the bank's CET1 ratio. ""What is very positive is the actual inflows, so the deposit reversal is taking place that's also a very good sign for the franchise,"" Surry said. ""The integration of Swiss operations from Credit Suisse is very much in line so nothing new there, but what's going to be very interesting is indeed the timeline of share buybacks, and for that we need to have the repayment of the funding line from the Swiss National Bank and also the demonstration that UBS has access to the AT1 markets following the write-downs of the Credit Suisse AT1s in March.""

The bank, in its own statement Monday, described the settlement as dealing with a ""legacy matter"" dating from 2006 to 2007, leading up to the financial crisis. The settlement concludes the final case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice against several of the largest financial institutions over misleading statements made to the purchasers of those mortgage-backed securities. The cumulative recoveries in the cases now total $36 billion, according to the Justice Department. UBS' settlement is nearly the same as the value of the residential mortgages it originated between 2005 and 2007, the year it stopped issuing residential mortgage-backed securities. UBS originated $1.5 billion in residential mortgages in those three years, the bank previously said in a 2018 statement challenging the Justice Department allegations. ""The vast majority of loans underlying the 40 RMBS listed in the complaint were originated by other financial institutions,"" UBS said at the time. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, investment banks packaged, securitized and sold bundles of mortgages to institutional buyers. Those securities were rated and graded according to quality, with various ""tranches"" of mortgages hypothetically safeguarding against the risk of complete default. But unbeknownst to the buyers, those mortgages were not as high quality as their ratings suggested. UBS, similar to other banks who settled with the Justice Department, were aware that the mortgages underneath the mortgage-backed securities didn't comply with underwriting standards. UBS conducted ""extensive"" due diligence on the underlying loans before it created and sold the securities to its clients, prosecutors alleged, and despite knowing of the significant issues with the products, continued to sell them to financial success. UBS had previously said that it had ""fulfilled"" its obligations to its clients, which the bank said were ""highly sophisticated investors"" and ""some of the biggest financial institutions in the world. The Justice Department has secured settlements with 18 other financial institutions over mortgage-backed security issues, including Bank of America, Citigroup, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.

The 9 billion Swiss franc LPA was intended to insure UBS on losses above 5 billion Swiss francs following the takeover, which was brokered over a frenetic weekend in March amid talks with the Swiss government, the SNB and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. The emergency rescue deal saw UBS acquire Credit Suisse for a discount price of 3 billion Swiss francs, creating a Swiss banking and wealth management behemoth with a $1.6 trillion balance sheet. ""After reviewing all assets covered by the LPA since the closing in June and taking the appropriate fair value adjustments, UBS has concluded that the LPA is no longer required,"" UBS said.

""Instead of competing, we'll now unite as we embark on the next chapter of our joint journey,"" UBS Group's newly-returned CEO Sergio Ermotti said in a statement. In an open letter, the bank's chiefs also said they would not compromise UBS's ""strong culture"" or ""conservative risk approach."" Risk management failures over a number of years played a key role in Credit Suisse's eventual downfall. Ermotti told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in a Monday interview that he believed the combined bank — which he said was the world's 21th largest — would ""compete better, serve our clients better."" ""We are the only bank with this kind of magnitude and size and scope that is focused on wealth management,"" Ermotti said. ""We need to make sure we don't fall back into any bad habits or do things the wrong way. But in that sense we have a very clear view on how to manage a UBS-led integration,"" he continued, as it seeks to ""restore confidence."" UBS Group will manage UBS and Credit Suisse as separate banks at least for the short term. Questions linger over the future of assets including Credit Suisse's prized retail bank. Following the acquisition, Credit Suisse and its American Depositary Shares will be delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange and New York Stock Exchange, with shareholders receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held. The enlarged UBS will have a balance sheet of $1.6 trillion and a workforce of 120,000. Ermotti previously warned the new group ""won't be able to create, short term, job opportunities for everybody. Synergies is part of the story."" The combined company will report its first consolidated results on August 31. UBS said Monday it expected ""Credit Suisse operating losses and significant restructuring charges"" to be offset as it ditches risk-weighted assets, and forecast a common equity tier 1 capital ratio — a measurement of capital against assets — of around 14% for the rest of the year. In an internal memo seen by CNBC, the bank announced that several senior Credit Suisse figures intend to leave the company, including Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi, who only took on the role in October, and Asia Pacific regional CEO Edwin Low. Simon Grimwood, currently Credit Suisse's global head of tax and finance change, will take over as Credit Suisse CFO. Grimwood has been managing integration planning since March, the bank said. Former Credit Suisse Co-head of Markets Michael Ebert will become head of the Credit Suisse investment bank and head of Americas at UBS investment bank, while Jake Scrivens will replace Markus Diethelm as general counsel. Credit Suisse Global Head of Operations Isabelle Hennebelle joins the board in her existing role as head of operations. Asked whether he was concerned about an exodus of talent, Ermotti told CNBC: ""We are always sorry to see talented people leaving, in other cases people were anticipating probably the inevitable restructuring that we will need to go through and decided to go."" He added that the bank had managed to attract external talent after the acquisition announcement. Ermotti's own return to the UBS top job was confirmed in March shortly after the takeover announcement to oversee the transition. He previously led the company from November 2011 to October 2020, managing the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis and a $2.3 billion loss stemming from a rogue trader in London. UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said he ""transformed"" the bank through cost cutting and implementing cultural changes. The $3.2 billion takeover was the tumultuous conclusion of a frantic weekend in March, when worries that severe losses at Credit Suisse would destabilize the banking system drew the key involvement of Swiss regulators. Sweetening the deal, the Swiss government has agreed to cover losses of up to 9 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) after UBS incurs the first 5 billion Swiss francs as part of the transaction, as the bank absorbs a portfolio that does not entirely ""fit its business and risk profile."" The takeover, which follows multiple scandals and years of share price decline at Credit Suisse, controversially wiped out the 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) worth of assets of the bank's AT1 bond holders. Beat Wittmann, co-founder and partner at Porta Advisors, said the speed with which UBS had managed the takeover was positive for the bank. Going forward will be ""certainly a challenge … but UBS, due to the emergency operation and the collective failure of policymakers and of course of Credit Suisse, got over a weekend an extraordinarily advantageous deal,"" Wittmann told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"". ""There's so much margin of safety in terms of price, in terms of credit lines, in terms of risk sharing with the government, that this is a great deal indeed."" Wittmann said that UBS faces several key challenges, the first of which is the physical integration of the two banking juggernauts and merging of their operating models. Citing a Financial Times report published over the weekend — which CNBC has not confirmed — that UBS had set ""red lines"" for Credit Suisse bankers including bans on new clients from high-risk countries and on launching new products without the approval of UBS managers, Wittmann said ""that's exactly what a bank should do in any case."" Addressing the report, Ermotti told CNBC: ""We have developed that 'red line', which I wouldn't really call a 'red line', over the course of years. This is simply what I mentioned before, we are introducing our processes, our operating model, into Credit Suisse. It's not meant to be discriminatory."" As for further challenges, Wittman drew attention to an upcoming parliamentary inquiry into the Credit Suisse takeover and wider banking stability. Swiss elections could also lead to ""populist demands,"" he stressed, as jobs are cut and branches close around Switzerland. A final trial is the broader macro environment, Wittman said, given the current credit crunch and likely financial market volatility resulting from higher interest rates.",2023-06-12,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/ubs-says-it-has-completed-the-takeover-of-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm="

UBS is no stranger to blockbuster mergers. The modern company is comprised of over 370 legacy firms, including former domestic rivals. Amid major wars, Switzerland has remained stable and neutral, becoming a safe haven for global wealth. Today, international wealth management is the heart of UBS's operation. With over $5 trillion in invested assets post-merger, more than half of the bank's customers are based in the United States. Experts believe this is due to the unique levels of discretion offered by Swiss law. Bankers in Switzerland are bound to protect many client details, even when pressed by foreign authorities.  ""You can access their operations in Singapore, in New York, in more exotic places. But at the core, they will not be subject to some political influence because the Swiss government is leaving them alone, or at least that's the perception,"" said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at both the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., and the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. In recent years, both UBS and Credit Suisse have faced pressure from U.S. authorities to end what has been criticized as dubious business practices. For example, in the 2010s, thousands of instances of misconduct were uncovered at UBS in an international interest rate manipulation probe. Additionally, U.S. senators claim that Credit Suisse maintained accounts linked to Nazi clients as recently as 2020. Global watchdogs have worried for years that banks like UBS have become too big to fail. A sudden and rapid flight of depositors from Credit Suisse brought those fears to life. The Swiss National Bank pledged over $100 billion in liquidity support to broker UBS's rapid takeover of Credit Suisse. In the deal, Credit Suisse shareholders expect to trade in 22.48 shares for 1 UBS share. Some bondholders plan to challenge the deal in court. ""By and large, what the Swiss government mostly did is impose losses on creditors and shareholders of Credit Suisse,"" said Véron. UBS Group AG said the acquisition may make the bank more competitive globally, and that it is prepared to manage that increased complexity.

"UBS expects $17 billion hit from Credit Suisse rescue, flags hasty due diligence","The bank's emergency acquisition of its stricken domestic rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) was brokered by Swiss authorities over the course of a weekend in March. UBS also expects to offset this by booking a one-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ""negative goodwill,"" which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth.UBS highlighted that the short time frame under which it was forced to conduct due diligence may have affected its ability to ""fully evaluate Credit Suisse's assets and liabilities"" prior to the takeover.","UBS estimates a financial hit of around $17 billion from its emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, according to a regulatory filing, and said the rushed deal may have affected its due diligence. In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Tuesday night, the Swiss banking giant flagged a total negative impact of around $13 billion in fair value adjustments of the new combined entity's assets and liabilities, along with a potential $4 billion hit from litigation and regulatory costs. However, UBS also expects to offset this by booking a one-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ""negative goodwill,"" which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth. The bank's emergency acquisition of its stricken domestic rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) was brokered by Swiss authorities over the course of a weekend in March, with Credit Suisse teetering on the brink of collapse amid massive customer deposit withdrawals and a plummeting share price. In the amended F-4 filing, UBS also highlighted that the short time frame under which it was forced to conduct due diligence may have affected its ability to ""fully evaluate Credit Suisse's assets and liabilities"" prior to the takeover. Swiss governmental authorities approached UBS on March 15 while considering whether to initiate a sale of Credit Suisse in order to ""calm markets and avoid the possibility of contagion in the financial system,"" the filing revealed. The bank had until March 19 to conduct its due diligence and return with a decision. ""If the circumstances of the due diligence affected UBS Group AG's ability to thoroughly consider Credit Suisse's liabilities and weaknesses, it is possible that UBS Group AG will have agreed to a rescue that is considerably more difficult and risky than it had contemplated,"" UBS said in the Risk Factors section of the filing. Though this is highlighted as a potential risk, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC last month that the Credit Suisse deal was not risky and would create long-term benefits. The most controversial aspect of the deal was regulator FINMA's decision to wipe out around $17 billion of Credit Suisse's additional tier-one (AT1) bonds before shareholdings, defying the conventional order of write downs and resulting in legal action from AT1 bondholders. Tuesday's filing showed the UBS Strategy Committee began evaluating Credit Suisse in October 2022 as its rival's financial situation worsened. The long-struggling lender experienced massive net asset outflows toward the end of 2022 on the back of liquidity concerns. The UBS Strategy Committee concluded in February that an acquisition of Credit Suisse was ""not desirable,"" and the bank continued to conduct analysis of the financial and legal implications of such a deal in case the situation deteriorated to the point that Swiss authorities would ask UBS to step in. UBS last week announced that Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner will join the executive board of the new combined entity once the deal legally closes, which is expected within the next few weeks. The group will operate as an ""integrated banking group"" with Credit Suisse retaining its brand independence for the foreseeable future, as UBS pursues a phased integration.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/ubs-expects-17-billion-hit-from-credit-suisse-rescue-flags-hasty-due-diligence.html?&qsearchterm="
"Sergio Ermotti returns as UBS CEO to oversee Credit Suisse takeover","Sergio Ermotti will replace current CEO Ralph Hamers, who is set to remain at UBS to advise the bank during the transition period to ensure a smooth hand-over, UBS said in a statement Wednesday.The move will be effective April 5, UBS said in a statement.Ermotti was group CEO at UBS for nine years, from November 2011 to October 2020, and is currently chairman of insurance company Swiss Re.","In this article UBS named Sergio Ermotti as its new Group CEO on Wednesday, following the recent acquisition of Credit Suisse. The move will be effective April 5, UBS said in a statement. Shares of UBS were up 2% at the open. Ermotti — who was group CEO at UBS for nine years from November 2011 to October 2020 — will replace the current CEO Ralph Hamers. Ermotti is currently the chairman of insurance company Swiss Re. Hamers will remain at UBS to advise the bank during the transition period to ""ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth hand-over,"" the company said. In a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators, Switzerland's largest bank UBS agreed on March 19 to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The move came as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system. The leadership change comes ""in light of the new challenges and priorities facing UBS after the announcement of the acquisition,"" UBS said Wednesday. The statement pointed to how Ermotti ""successfully repositioned"" the bank following the 2008 global financial crisis, and ""achieved a profound culture change within the bank."" That allowed the Swiss lender to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people's pride in working for UBS,"" the bank said. Hamers told employees of the government-orchestrated takeover that UBS ""did not buy Credit Suisse only to close it,"" Reuters reported. In the announcement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called Hamers an ""outstanding"" CEO who led UBS to ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment."" While the acquisition of Credit Suisse supports UBS' existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on the group, he said. ""With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks' clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland,"" Kelleher said. The move surprised some market observers, but one analyst said it was just part of the fallout from the merger deal. As with ""all forced mergers or an acquisition of not equal parties, you can always have this friction and I think that's what you see at play here,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It was very clear that the now former CEO at UBS was not really happy about this shotgun wedding and I think that's the fallout you see now."" Notably, in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag in September, Ermotti argued that there was no ""compelling"" economic reason for Switzerland to have two big banks. ""Everything we have seen, I think, since the global financial crisis with regulation is leading us down one path, of bigger and bigger and banks, more and more concentration, which leads to fragility but also less competition and I'm not sure it's long term going to be good for the overall financial system,"" Garnry argued. ""It puts the conversation out there: are we moving towards more public interference with money itself?"" He said the discussions in the U.S. after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is, ""to what degree should there be guarantees on deposits above the FDIC deposit guarantee limit? If you do that, what is the purpose of having banks, private money etc?"" ""I think there are big questions here about this and where we're heading in the banking system,"" Garnry said. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kelleher stressed that Ermotti's Swiss nationality is a ""nice thing,"" but not a main driver behind the appointment decision. He stressed the ""significant execution risk"" of implementing UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, noting the new CEO's expertise best equips him as the ""best pilot"" to navigate the challenge.  He signaled the Swiss government were advised of Ermotti's designation.  ""Clearly regulators have a right of saying no. So we have to make sure that there is approval and Sergio is approved for this role,"" he said.  Ermotti expressed interest to remain in the position long term, saying that the tasks ahead align with his vision for UBS. ""There is a sense in me, and I felt, a sense of call of duty aspect. And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions around the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one,"" he said.  Hamers noted that he has stepped aside in the interest of the new combined bank, of its stakeholders and of the broader Swiss nation. He said that the bank wants to ""take away uncertainty as soon as we can"" regarding its restructuring and prospective layoff plans. He downplayed the potential risks posed by the combined bank's scale:  ""I always say the big debate nowadays is not too big to fail, it's too small to survive."" Kelleher echoed the view, observing that UBS has a capital-light balance sheet and that the group's strategy is to downsize the non-core units of Credit Suisse as quickly as possible. Critically, he flagged the importance of matching the perspectives of the two banks:  ""There are cultural issues between Credit Suisse and UBS. We do not want to import a bad culture into UBS,"" he said, noting that the core of this cultural conflict was in the investment bank branch of reputationally-challenged Credit Suisse.  — CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.",2023-03-29,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/ubs-names-sergio-ermotti-as-its-new-ceo-following-acquisition-of-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm="
"'Shotgun wedding': What the UBS rescue of Credit Suisse means for global markets","Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets.The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, but shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday.While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail.","In this article In equal parts ""shotgun wedding"" and arranged marriage, UBS agreed to buy stricken domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) on Sunday. Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets. After years of heavy losses and costly scandals, Credit Suisse's most recent share price plunge began with the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and was compounded when top investor the Saudi National Bank said it could not provide any more financial assistance. The announcement of a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank failed to soothe investor concerns and eventually necessitated the 167-year-old institution's ""emergency rescue"" by UBS. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told a press conference Sunday that the ""latest developments that emanated from the banks in the U.S. hit us at the most unfavorable moment."" ""The accelerating loss of confidence and the escalation over the last few days have made it clear that Credit Suisse can no longer exist in its current form,"" Lehmann said. ""We are happy to have found a solution, which I'm convinced will bring lasting stability and security for clients, staff, financial markets and to Switzerland."" The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. The deal also includes support from the Swiss government, financial regulator FINMA, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will offer a liquidity line of up to 100 billion Swiss francs, backed by a federal default guarantee. The government will offer a loss guarantee of up to 9 billion Swiss francs, with UBS assuming the first 5 billion of potential losses. Shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday morning, however. Goldman Sachs said in a note late Sunday that the deal and associated liquidity and loss guarantees provided ""clarity"" and dampened tail risks. The U.S. bank has shifted back to an overweight allocation on European banks as a result. ""Of course, we are mindful that the situation among U.S. regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from U.S. regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist,"" the Wall Street giant's credit strategists said. Goldman also reiterated its favorable view on U.S. ""money center"" banks, a view echoed by Smead Capital Management's CEO Cole Smead, who said interest rate rises from central banks help lenders ""that don't do stupid things in their assets."" ""Poor stock markets have caused investment banks to be the laggards, but commercial banks look good next to them,"" he said via email, naming JPMorgan and Bank of America as stocks he particularly likes. Smead also said investors could expect higher returns on assets from the new UBS-Credit Suisse entity, along with more consolidation in the European banking sector. But bigger questions remain over the potential market impact of the deal. James Sym, head of equities at London-based investment manager River and Mercantile, told CNBC that the market was in ""seek and destroy mode."" ""This solves what I think is probably an idiosyncratic problem at Credit Suisse, but I'm not sure it's a firebreak big enough to stop the rot for the market,"" he said Monday. Although he added that the rest of the European banking system is ""much more robust"" than it was."" Since the Global Financial Crisis, the continent's banks have built much larger capital buffers in order to withstand systemic risks. Sym suggested that if European bank shares fall significantly as a result of the deal, he might ""start to nibble"" at some stocks, potentially even UBS. ""In the short term, the market is not going to like this deal for UBS, it's not core to the strategy, but I think over the medium term it does potentially give them an edge to compete globally with the Americans and really puts them in an unassailable position domestically."" While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail as the finer points are hashed out over the coming weeks and months. ""One issue is that the reported price of $3.25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. ""This suggests that a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570bn assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired. This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks."" Shearing added that there may yet be risks to the deal ""for legal or financial reasons, or if confidence in UBS is dented and it gets cold feet about the deal."" ""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" he added. As part of the deal, Swiss regulator FINMA announced the wipeout of 16 billion Swiss francs' worth of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which some investors fear signals further spillover risk for global credit. This was a major focal point for analysts assessing the potential ramifications on Monday morning. ""AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail,"" explained Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank. ""They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank's capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business. According to the Swiss bail-in regime, AT1 debt is above equity in the loss absorption waterfall."" The entire AT1 tranche of bonds being written down to zero, Monchau suggested, is an ""arresting development"" given that unsecured bondholders usually rank higher than equity holders in the capital structure. He argued that this raises questions about the real value of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds and creates contagion risks. ""There is also a risk of spillover effect on global credit (although we note that senior secured bonds seem quite resilient including CS senior secured bonds which are jumping in price this morning),"" he added. Goldman highlighted that the write-down constitutes the largest loss ever inflicted on AT1 investors since the post-GFC birth of the asset class, and argued that although it preserves some shareholder value, the decision ""greatly weakens the case to add risk."" ""Whether investors treat this decision as a one-off or whether they rethink the asymmetry of their risk-reward at times of elevated financial distress remains to be seen,"" the bank's credit strategists said. ""But in our view, it has become harder to assess the attractiveness of the current historically large spread pick-up provided by AT1 bonds vs. their HY (high-yield) corporate counterparts, which will likely constrain the appetite towards the AT1 asset class.""",2023-03-20,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/what-ubs-rescue-of-credit-suisse-cs-means-for-markets-and-banks.html?&qsearchterm="

The Swiss National Bank also pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover. ","In this article UBS agreed to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) Sunday, with Swiss regulators playing a key part in the deal as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system. ""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" read a statement from the Swiss National Bank, which noted the central bank worked with the Swiss government and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to bring about the combination of the country's two largest banks. The terms of the deal will see Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold. ""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,"" said UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher in a statement. The combined bank will have $5 trillion of invested assets, according to UBS. ""We are committed to making this deal a great success. There are no options in this,"" Kelleher said when asked during the press conference if the bank could back out of the deal. ""This is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and ... to global finance."" The Swiss National Bank pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover. The Swiss government also granted a guarantee to assume losses up to 9 billion Swiss francs from certain assets over a preset threshold ""in order to reduce any risks for UBS,"" said a separate government statement. ""This is a commercial solution and not a bailout,"" said Karin Keller-Sutter, the Swiss finance minister, in a press conference Sunday. The UBS deal was scrambled together before markets reopened for trading Monday after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The losses came despite a new loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) granted from the Swiss central bank last week, in an effort to halt the slide and restore confidence in the bank. News of the deal was welcomed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a statement. ""The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient. We have been in close contact with our international counterparts to support their implementation,"" they said. Credit Suisse had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and in the last two weeks, sentiment was rocked again as banks in the U.S. reeled from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. U.S. regulators' backstop of uninsured deposits in the failed banks and the creation of a new funding facility for troubled financial institutions failed to stem the shock and is threatening to envelop more banks both in the U.S. and abroad. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said in the press conference that the financial instability brought about by the collapsed U.S. regional banks hit the bank at the wrong time. Despite regulators' involvement in the pairing, the deal gives UBS autonomy to run the acquired assets as it sees fit, which could mean significant job cuts, sources told CNBC's David Faber. Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than U.S. regional banks, which pressured Swiss regulators to find a way to bring the country's two largest financial institutions together. Credit Suisse's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers' when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of the end of 2022. It is also far more globally interconnected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important. Bringing the two rivals together was not without its struggles, but pressure to stave off a systemic crisis won out in the end. UBS initially offered to buy Credit Suisse for around $1 billion Sunday, according to multiple media reports. Credit Suisse reportedly balked at the offer, arguing it was too low and would hurt shareholders and employees, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.  By Sunday afternoon, UBS was in talks to buy the bank for ""substantially"" more than 1 billion Swiss francs, sources told CNBC's Faber. He said the price of the deal increased throughout the day's negotiations.  Credit Suisse lost around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022 and revealed in its delayed annual report early last week that outflows have still yet to reverse. It reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022 and expects a further ""substantial"" loss in 2023.

The 1,128 shareholders gathered in Basel were looking for clarity on the board's integration plan after the ""shotgun wedding"" between Switzerland's two biggest banks, which remains mired in controversy, legal peril and public skepticism. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told the audience that March 19, the date of the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse from the brink of collapse, was a ""historic day and a day we hoped would never come."" But he said the merger also presents ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial sector as a whole."" He emphasized UBS' continued focus on its wealth management and Swiss business and confirmed that the bank would reduce the capital allocated to its investment arm to below 25% of risk-weighted assets. ""Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive to UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said, while acknowledging there is a ""huge amount of risk"" associated with the integration. The Credit Suisse integration is expected to take around three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio. Kelleher said the bank expects to remain well capitalized and ""significantly above"" its capital targets by the time the deal closes. New UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti began his second tenure on Wednesday after his shock reappointment last week, with the board having decided that he was the right man to lead the mammoth task of integrating the bank's fallen compatriot's business. Ermotti's return was seen by many commentators as an attempt to restore calm, as the country's long-established reputation for financial stability teeters on the brink. UBS reported a full-year profit of $7.6 billion in 2022, and its shares remain up more than 10% since the turn of the year. Concerns remain over the scale of the new entity, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, and whether it creates too much concentrated risk for the Swiss and global economy. Reports have suggested that UBS' plans may include job cuts of around 20-30% of the combined entity's global workforce, but the bank's Vice Chairman said Wednesday that it was too early to offer any concrete estimates. Credit Suisse held the final independent AGM in its 167-year history in Zurich on Tuesday, after Swiss authorities brokered an ""emergency rescue"" in late March, when the bank's share price tumbled and depositors fled en masse. The board was angrily confronted on Tuesday by shareholders demanding answers and accountability over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.3 billion) deal, which was rushed through over the course of a weekend and denied both UBS and Credit Suisse shareholders a vote. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" to shareholders, clients and employees, and suggested the bank's turnaround plan after years of losses, scandals and compliance failures had been on track until turmoil in the U.S. banking sector sparked a flight of confidence. Peter V. Kunz, chair in Economic Law and Comparative Law at the University of Bern, told CNBC on Wednesday that the mood in Basel was ""totally different"" to that in Zurich on Tuesday. ""Yesterday, people were angry, they were frustrated. Basically, CS shareholders were the losers. Here, you see the winners,"" he told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche outside the meeting. ""They are gleeful, they are happy, they see the prospects of the future, some might even be triumphant because there was some bad blood between these two banks. They were rivals,"" Kunz added, though he acknowledged that some shareholders remain uncertain about the outlook for the combined entity.

""The rate environment is helping the business on one side, and that offsets some of the lower activity that we see on the investment side,"" CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Tuesday.The Swiss bank said it will be purchasing more of its own shares this year.","In this article UBS' fourth-quarter profit beat market expectations, but the Swiss banking giant reported a fall in revenues on the back of weaker client activity and warned of an ""uncertain"" year ahead. The bank reported $1.7 billion of net income for the fourth quarter of last year, bringing its full-year profit to $7.6 billion in 2022. Analysts had expected UBS to post net income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and of $7.3 billion for the year, according to Refinitiv data. The bank's Global Wealth Management unit posted a fourth-quarter increase in net interest income of 35% on the year, given higher deposit margins off the back of higher interest rates. Its Personal and Corporate Banking division also recorded a 21% year-on-year hike in net interest income over the same period, as a result of higher interest rates and loan revenues. But market uncertainty hit the investment banking and asset management arms of the business. The former saw a 24% yearly drop in revenues, whereas asset management revenues fell by 31% year-on-year due to the ""negative market performance and foreign currency effects."" ""The rate environment is helping the business on one side, and that offsets some of the lower activity that we see on the investment side,"" CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore on Tuesday. He added that there had been a shift in the markets that put pressure on the investment side of the bank. ""We saw a move from what we would call micro focus, which is equity-focused, to macro focus, which is rates focused,"" he said, noting that the Swiss bank was not able to benefit from that transition as much as some of its peers, given its smaller presence in the U.S. Here are some other highlights from the results: Looking ahead, the Swiss lender said that revenues for the first quarter of 2023 were set to be ""positively influenced"" by higher client activity and interest rates, as well as by the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Asia. However, it was cautious about the economic outlook more broadly, citing central bank activity as a potential catalyst for market volatility. ""While inflation may have peaked in the second half of 2022, and an energy crisis in Europe seems likely to be averted, the outlook for economic growth, asset valuations and market volatility remains highly uncertain, and central bank tightening may have an impact on market liquidity,"" the bank said its earnings release. UBS said it will be purchasing more of its own shares this year. ""We remain committed to a progressive dividend and expect to repurchase more than $5 billion of shares in 2023,"" Hamers said in a statement accompanying the results. Shares in the bank fell more than 2% in early European trade. ""UBS posted what we think are mixed fourth quarter results,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a Tuesday note. ""Going through the details, our strong first impression gets tempered as the higher earnings are actually driven by some one-offs in revenues as well as a low tax rate.

Analysts had expected a net profit of $1.64 billion, according to Refinitiv data. UBS reported a net income of $2.3 billion a year ago. The Swiss lender had missed expectations in the last quarter when it posted a net profit of $2.108 billion. The bank said at the time the second quarter had been ""one of the most challenging periods for investors in the last 10 years"" due to high inflation, the war in Ukraine and strict Covid-19 policies in Asia. UBS said Tuesday these factors continued to be in investors' minds in the third quarter. ""The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment has become increasingly complex. Clients remain concerned about persistently high inflation, elevated energy prices, the war in Ukraine and residual effects of the pandemic,"" Ralph Hamers, CEO of UBS, said in a statement. Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore, Hamers said, however, that there have been very strong flows into the business over the quarter, with net new fee-generating assets at $17 billion. Other highlights for the quarter included: Its investment banking division saw revenues down by 19% with the lower performance in equity derivatives, cash equities, and financing revenue being offset by revenues in foreign exchange. The Global Wealth Management division also reported lower revenues, down by 4% year-on-year. However, Personal and Corporate Banking revenues rose over the same period on more beneficial rates from the Swiss National Bank. Hamers noted Tuesday that clients on its wealth side were looking for alternative investments and cash, and he predicted that activity on the institutional side of its trading unit would remain weak in the fourth quarter. UBS is aiming to improve its business in Asia-Pacific and CEO Hamers said he sees ""some opportunities to grow"" in China. ""The confirmation of [China President] Xi for another term is on one side basically the confirmation of consistency going forward, so some of the policies that he has come out with over the last year will most likely be continued,"" Hamers said. He added that the Swiss bank looks at China ""by virtue of its demographics and some of the dimensions of the economy."" ""We think over time it is a very attractive place, so it is a strategic place,"" he added. Elsewhere, Hamers expects a ""challenging"" time for Europe given the ongoing energy crisis and war in Ukraine.

""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic.""","In this article The demise of banking giant Credit Suisse sent shock waves through financial markets and appears to have dealt a blow to Switzerland's reputation for stability, with one executive suggesting investors will now look at the mountainous central European country as ""a financial banana republic."" UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, agreed on Sunday to buy its embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) as part of a government-backed, cut-price deal. Swiss authorities and regulators helped to negotiate the agreement, which came amid fears of contagion to the global banking system after two smaller U.S. banks collapsed in recent weeks. The rescue deal means Switzerland, a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy, is on track to see its two biggest and best-known banks merge into just one financial giant. ""Switzerland's standing as a financial centre is shattered,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, said in a research note. ""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic."" ""The Credit Suisse debacle will have serious ramifications for other Swiss financial institutions. A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,"" Marenzi said. A spokesperson for the Swiss regulator FINMA declined to comment. Shares of Swiss-listed UBS on Tuesday rose 7.3% by around 12:50 p.m. London time (8:50 a.m. ET), extending gains after closing higher in the previous session. Credit Suisse traded up 3.5% during afternoon deals after ending Monday's session down a whopping 55%. Under the terms of the emergency takeover, investors in Credit Suisse's additional tier-one bonds — widely regarded as a relatively risky investment — will see the value of their holdings slashed to zero. It means investments worth roughly 16 billion francs will become worthless. AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos,"" are a type of debt that is considered part of a bank's regulatory capital. Holders can convert them into equity or write them down in certain situations – for example when a bank's capital ratio falls below a previously agreed threshold. ""The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete write-down of the nominal value of all AT1 debt of Credit Suisse in the amount of around CHF 16 billion, and thus an increase in core capital,"" FINMA said Sunday. The unconventional move is at odds with the typical practice of prioritizing bondholders over shareholders when a bank fails and prompted turmoil in the market for convertible bank bonds on Monday. Vítor Constâncio, who served as the vice president of the European Central Bank from 2010 to 2018, said via Twitter that FINMA's announcement was a ""mistake with consequences and potentially a host of court cases.""

""This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions,"" they said. The Bank of England echoed this sentiment shortly thereafter. ""Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy,"" the BOE said. ""One feature of this whole banking pressure that we've seen over the last week or two is that actually yes we've seen major volatility in equity markets, major volatility in fixed income markets, and also commodity markets, but very little volatility in foreign exchange markets,"" Bob Parker, senior advisor at the International Capital Markets Association, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Asked about how investors might now think of Switzerland's reputation for stability, Parker replied, ""When I was in Zurich last week, this subject actually was a hot topic."" He said there had been ""some very modest"" weakness in the Swiss franc against the euro in recent days, noting that this is the currency pair the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, focuses on. One euro was last seen trading at 0.9961 Swiss francs, weakening from 0.9810 when compared with March 14. ""We've moved back close to parity on Swiss franc-euro. So, I think to answer your question, yes, to some extent the Swiss franc as a safe haven currency has lost some of its allure. There is no doubt about that,"" Parker said. ""Will that be regained? Probably yes, I would argue this is very much sort of a short-term effect,"" he added. — CNBC's Elliot Smith and Sophie Kiderlin contributed to this report.",2023-03-22,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/ubs-credit-suisse-deal-puts-switzerlands-reputation-on-the-line.html?&qsearchterm="

Both GM and Ford shares are off about 45% year to date. Both companies have a market capitalization of just under $50 billion. UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in notes to investors Monday that he expects the U.S. automotive industry to be challenging for the foreseeable future following record profit amid low supplies and high demand during the coronavirus pandemic. He predicted ""it will take three to six months for the auto industry to end up in oversupply, which will put an abrupt end to a 3-year phase of unprecedented"" pricing power and profit margins for the automakers. The investment firm downgraded Ford to ""sell"" from ""neutral"" and GM to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""

Analyst Karl Keirstead downgraded Microsoft to neutral from buy, writing that the latest round of field checks into the business lowered the bank's confidence in the stock. Keirstead pointed to concerns at Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, and Office 365, the company's family of productivity software. The analyst said Office 365, which has been a ""remarkably steady machine of late,"" could see slower revenue growth in 2023, while Azure is entering a ""steep growth deceleration"" that could be worse in 2023 and 2024 than investors are expecting.  Microsoft provides year-over-year growth for Azure and other cloud services but doesn't give a dollar figure, nor does it specify how much of the growth comes just from Azure. The Azure and other cloud services segment also includes, among other things, enterprise mobility and security, or EMS, tools that can be sold separately. Cloud rival Google put together an estimate of Microsoft's Azure business, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market data.

"UBS expects 50,000 store closures in the U.S. over the next 5 years after pandemic pause","While analysts at UBS see more pain ahead, it's not as many closures as the investment bank had initially projected about a year ago. UBS is now projecting between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the United States closing over the next five years, down from the 80,000 closures it previously forecasted. ","A pandemic shakeup in 2020 led to a surge in store closures, coupled with dozens retailers filing for bankruptcy, which emptied out shopping malls and left vacancies scattered along the streets major markets including New York City. The aftermath, though, was a temporary relief from closures, as companies took the chance in 2020 to quickly slim down their store counts when consumers were holed up at home. In fact, in 2021, retailers reported net store openings, marking a sudden reversal from years of net declines. Companies seized the opportunity to take advantage of cheap rents and an eagerness among Americans to get out and shop again. While analysts at UBS see more pain ahead, it's not as many closures as the investment bank had initially projected about a year ago. Brick-and-mortar shops have proven to serve a critical role for retailers' businesses during the Covid pandemic, the bank said in a new report on Wednesday, and retail sales growth has remained strong, in part due to rising inflation. This all bodes well for the future of physical stores, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. UBS is now projecting between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the United States closing over the next five years, down from the 80,000 closures it previously forecasted. That's out of about 880,000 total retail stores that the firm tracks nationwide, excluding gas stations. This estimate assumes that U.S. retail sales grow about 4% annually, moving forward, and that e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales grows to 25% by 2026, from 18% in 2021, Lasser said in the report. UBS sees the most closures shaking out among clothing and accessories retailers, consumer electronics businesses and home furnishing chains, or about 23,500 cumulatively within these categories by 2026. Traditional shopping malls remain at higher risk for closures than neighborhood strip centers, the firm said. That's in large part because shopper traffic to malls, often anchored by department store chains, has been pressured in recent years as consumers favor quick trips to stores closer to where they live. Meanwhile, general merchandise retailers, such as Target and Walmart, and auto parts businesses are expected to report net openings in the years ahead. According to Lasser and his team, there is still about 58 square feet of shopping center space per household in the U.S., as of 2021. While that's down from the 62 square feet per household in 2010, it's above 55 square feet in 2000 and 49 square feet in 1990. As consumers shift more of their spending onto the web, it only makes sense that that number would shrink, Lasser explained. So far this year, retailers' plans to open new locations are far outpacing their plans to shutter shops. Tracking data by Coresight Research show U.S. retailers having announced just 1,385 store closures, compared with a whopping 3,694 openings, as of April 1. The store growth is being driven by dollar chains and discount stores, like Dollar General and TJX – and also by a wave of so-called digitally native companies that started on the internet but are now seeking acquiring new customers via bricks and mortar. Some examples include Warby Parker, Allbirds, Vuori, Brooklinen and Fabletics. UBS, which releases these closely followed, deep-dive store closure reports every few years, said that the number of shopping centers in the U.S. reached a peak of 115,000 last year, up from 90,000 in 2000, despite a continued acceleration in e-commerce.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/ubs-50000-retail-store-closures-in-us-by-2026-after-pandemic-pause.html?&qsearchterm="

The Swiss bank also set ambitious new profitability targets as part of a strategic update. UBS posted net profit attributable to shareholders of $1.35 billion for the fourth quarter, down from $1.64 billion a year earlier and also lower than the $2.28 billion reported in the previous quarter. Analysts had forecast UBS to post net income attributable to shareholders of $863 million, according to the consensus published by the bank. ""The fourth quarter was a very good ending to a record year, the best year in 15 years, both from a pre-tax and a post-tax perspective,"" CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC on Tuesday. ""The markets business held up really well with an operating income of 11% increase year-on-year, we saw net new money in the asset manager at $16 billion and we saw $27 billion of fee-generating assets coming in in the wealth manager,"" he said. The quarterly figures take the bank's full-year profit to $7.46 billion, above a company-compiled consensus of $6.98 billion and 14% higher than the previous year. However, UBS' bottom line was hit by an increase of $740 million in litigation provisions for a French cross-border tax case. In late December, the bank filed an appeal with France's Supreme Court against a decision by a Paris appeals court to uphold a money laundering conviction, although with a reduced penalty. Hamers said the bank was still assessing how best to approach the ongoing appeal against the ruling. ""Given the fact that you have another verdict here, we also looked at the overall case, whether we needed to change the provision that we already had,"" he told CNBC. ""Our best estimate at this moment in time, in terms of what could be payable at a certain moment in time, is 1.1 billion euro [$1.24 billion], and therefore we had to increase our provisioning by another 650 million euros, which is $740 million."" Here are other highlights for the third quarter: ""We are aiming to create sustainable value through the cycle. Reflecting our improved operating performance over the last two years, we have updated our financial targets, while our capital guidance remains unchanged,"" the bank said in a statement accompanying the results. In its first major strategic update since Hamers took the reins in Nov. 2020, UBS said it will aim for $6 trillion in invested assets across its global wealth management, asset management and personal and corporate banking divisions. Meanwhile, the bank set the target range for its return on CET1 capital at 15-18% and cost-to-income ratio at 70-73%. The bank will also aim for 10-15% growth in profit before tax at its wealth management business. ""Our new aspirations, targets and goals will position us to live up to our purpose, better serve clients, deploy technology in differentiated and impactful ways, and open our ecosystem for new and existing clients,"" CEO Ralph Hamers added in a statement. UBS proposed a dividend to shareholders of 50 cents per share for 2021, rising from 37 cents in 2020, and aims to buy back $5 billion worth of its own shares in 2022.

The Swiss bank posted a net profit attributable to shareholders of $2.108 billion, below analyst expectations aggregated by the company of $2.403 billion. It marks a 5% rise from the $2 billion reported during the same period last year, when the flagship wealth management business saw a significant windfall from wealthy investors, and follows a strong first-quarter that saw the group post a net profit of $2.136 billion. ""The second quarter was one of the most challenging periods for investors in the last 10 years. Inflation continues to be high, the war in Ukraine is ongoing, as are strict Covid policies in parts of Asia,"" UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said in a statement. ""In these uncertain times, our clients rely on our powerful ecosystem to navigate markets and invest for the long term."" Other highlights for the quarter: Investment banking revenues came in at $2.094 billion, down 14% from the same period last year. In its report, the bank highlighted a $1.121 billion fall in net fee and commission income, mainly reflecting a ""decrease in underwriting fees, particularly in Equity Capital Markets, and a decrease in net brokerage fees due to lower levels of client activity in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank."" ""Investment fund fees decreased, reflecting negative market performance and lower performance fees, and revenues from merger and acquisition transactions also decreased,"" the report added. Although the wealth management business took a hit from a broad decline in markets, Hamers said this had been largely offset by rising interest rates, with the U.S. Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive hiking cycle in a bid to reel in inflation. ""On our recurring revenues, you see a decrease because of the level of the markets having gone down. You see on the transaction revenues a decrease as well because clients have been sidelining their investments,"" he told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore on Tuesday. ""However, you see a 24% uptick in net interest income on the back of rising rates, and as a consequence of that, the overall revenues in the wealth management business for the quarter were only -2% in very difficult circumstances."" As market declines accelerated across equity and fixed income in the second quarter, the bank's wealth management division saw muted net new fee-generating assets of around $400 million globally, though inflows were over $3 billion net positive in Asia-Pacific. ""On the one side, we saw already for a couple of quarters the trend of clients being lower on transactions, holding back on transactions,"" Hamers told CNBC on Tuesday. ""On the other side, we've seen specifically this quarter, really big net new fee-generating assets coming through – $3.3 billion in Asia-Pacific – which basically shows you that clients are moving away from transactions into mandate business, and that's been always part of our strategy."" The asset management business also saw $12 billion of outflows, primarily from equities. Hamers said he was a little more positive on the macroeconomic and market outlook in Asia toward the end of the third quarter, when more clarity has been established about the political situation in China, meaning a firming up of economic policies and the possibility of further lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.",2022-07-26,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/ubs-q2-earnings-2022.html?&qsearchterm="

The stock dropped 3.4% on Monday to close at $142.05, bringing its decline for the year to 43%, second worst among members of the S&P 500. Tesla cut prices in the U.S., China and throughout Europe, with reductions of as much as $2,000 on the company's most popular electric vehicles, the Model Y SUV and entry-level Model 3 sedan. Tesla also lowered the price of its premium driver assistance system by one-third. The system is marketed as the Full Self-Driving, or FSD, option, though it requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. The FSD option, which previously cost $12,000 up front or $199 per month on a subscription basis for most customers in the U.S., is now listed on Tesla's website at $8,000 upfront and $99 for a monthly subscription. The price cut follows a monthlong free trial that Tesla pushed out to customers throughout North America starting in late March. The latest reductions add to investors' growing fears following weak first-quarter deliveries, layoffs and a Cybertruck recall. Last week, Tesla issued a voluntary recall on 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles to repair a serious ""trapped pedal"" defect seen in a viral TikTok video from a Cybertruck owner. According to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a pad on top of the Cybertruck's accelerator pedal could come loose and get trapped in the interior trim causing ""unintended acceleration."" Prior to the recall notice and price cuts, Tesla had initiated a steep and messy restructuring, informing employees early last week that it would be cutting more than 10% of its global workforce. The layoffs are ongoing, with some employees receiving notifications their jobs were eliminated in the last couple days, according to two current employees, who spoke with CNBC on condition that their names be withheld from publication. Tesla plans to discuss first-quarter earnings on a call Tuesday afternoon after releasing results. Analysts are expecting a 5.1% drop in revenue, according to LSEG, which would be the first year-over-year decline since the second quarter of 2020, when the Covid pandemic disrupted operations. ""Since late 2023, sentiment on Tesla (TSLA) has deteriorated,"" John Murphy, an analyst at Bank of America, wrote in a note on Monday. Murphy said he expects investors will ""focus heavily on commentary related to growth initiatives,"" specifically the Model 2 ""next-gen platform,"" and the robotaxi. Reuters reported that, at Musk's direction, Tesla is ""scrapping"" plans to launch a very affordable Model 2 electric car in the near term and will instead focus on development of a robotaxi. Joseph Spak, an analyst at UBS, wrote in a Monday report that investors should ""expect some fireworks"" on the call, adding that automotive gross margins for Tesla, not including environmental credits, and free cash flow will be key metrics. ""A negative free cashflow quarter appears possible,"" Spak wrote. That cash becomes more important to the Tesla story because ""the current environment doesn't allow funding of both"" the robotaxi and a more affordable new EV. Traders betting against Tesla are reaping rewards from the stock slide. Short interest in the EV maker stood at around 111 million shares, or 4% of float, representing $16.3 billion in notional value as of the first half of the day on Monday, according to S3 Partners. Tesla short sellers are up an estimated $9.4 billion this year, making it the most profitable short in the U.S. market, way ahead of Apple at $3 billion. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

"Oracle met with Senate aides about TikTok data storage after House ban passed ","Oracle privately met with Senate aides about their data housing agreement with TikTok after a bill that could ban the social media app from use in the United States passed the House in mid-March.If the social media app is banned, Oracle could face financial headwinds, according to analysts. Oracle met with a mix of staffers from the Senate Commerce Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss efforts to house U.S. TikTok's users data on Oracle cloud servers","In this article Oracle's top lobbyist in Washington met privately with Senate aides about the company's data housing agreement with TikTok this spring, after a bill that could effectively ban the social media app in the United States passed the House in mid-March. Oracle acts as the data center for U.S. TikTok users. The House legislation would require TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest the social media app, or face an eventual ban in the United States. ""We had four meetings, primarily to discuss the technical mitigations"" of the data storage project, said Oracle EVP Ken Glueck, who described the previously unreported talks to CNBC on Monday. To set up the meetings, Oracle turned to two lobbying firms: Fierce Government Relations and Polaris Government Relations, according to Glueck and newly filed disclosure reports. Glueck led discussions with staffers for the Senate Commerce Committee and the Intelligence Committee, he said. Two of the meetings were in person, and two were over Zoom, he added. Glueck said Oracle did not lobby for or against the TikTok bill, and only disclosed the meetings on mandatory filings in order to be transparent. If TikTok is banned, Oracle could face financial headwinds, according to market analysts. ""In a TikTok ban or shut-down scenario, Oracle would lose what is likely its largest OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] customer. This would be a negative, there is no sugar-coating it,"" analysts at UBS said in a research note. The deal between TikTok and Oracle is reportedly worth $1 billion. The Commerce Committee is chaired by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., while Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. leads the Intelligence Committee. Though the initial House bill briefly stalled in the Senate, a similar piece of legislation passed the House on Saturday and already has key support in the Senate. Both Cantwell and Warner have said that it could take up to a year for TikTok to be successfully divested from ByteDance if President Joe Biden signs a ban into law. News of the meetings came after TikTok's lobbyists reportedly complained to lawmakers that Oracle hadn't done enough to lobby against the legislation. TikTok has spent millions on advertising and other lobbying efforts to try to stop the legislation from passing Congress. Records show that Oracle paid $90,000 to Fierce and $80,000 Polaris in the first three months of the year. They were the only two outside firms Oracle paid this quarter that focused on this issue. The services included providing congressional offices ""technical assistance"" in regards to the TikTok legislation, according to the disclosures. The Internal Revenue Service defines this type of assistance as lawmakers turning to industry experts for guidance, especially when a bill is being deliberated in Congress. Oracle has one of the most formidable in-house lobbying shops in Washington, and it reported spending over $2.4 million year to date to influence policy, according to disclosures. This included in-house lobbying on TikTok, alongside a dozen other issues.",2024-04-22,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/22/oracle-met-with-senate-aides-on-tiktok-data-housing-project.html?&qsearchterm="
"What investors should know about the UAW's organizing drive of VW","Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted in favor of joining the United Auto Workers – marking the Detroit union's first victory at a foreign-owned automaker plant in the South.The historic vote could have wide-ranging impacts on other automakers, organized labor and the overall U.S. automotive industry.VW and the union, barring any challenges to voting, are expected to move forward with bargaining over a contract for roughly 4,300 workers covered under the vote.","In this article DETROIT – The United Auto Workers notched a big win this weekend. Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted in favor of joining the UAW late Friday – marking the Detroit union's first victory at a foreign-owned automaker plant in the South. The vote could have wide-ranging impacts on other automakers, organized labor and the overall U.S. automotive industry. ""This is a really profound victory for the UAW and the labor movement in general,"" said Alex Hertel-Fernandez, a former Department of Labor official and an international and public affairs professor at Columbia University. ""It's also a really decisive victory."" Union organizing passed with 73% of the vote, or 2,628 workers, in support of the UAW, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw voting from Wednesday to Friday. The German automaker and union, barring any challenges to voting, are expected to move forward with bargaining over a contract for roughly 4,300 workers covered under the vote. The NLRB still needs to certify the results. Here's what investors should know about the vote and next steps for the UAW: The UAW saw the Friday vote as the union's best shot at organizing the VW plant following strikes and record contracts with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis in 2023. The union, led by President Shawn Fain, is using the deals with the Detroit automakers, which included record wage increases and benefits, as springboards for an unprecedented organizing drive of 13 non-union automakers in the U.S. Other than Volkswagen, the union is targeting: BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Lucid, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Rivian, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota and Volvo. The drive covers nearly 150,000 U.S. autoworkers, according to the UAW. ""This is likely to be contagious,"" said Hertel-Fernandez. ""Where workers see successes in organizing or strikes, it tends to inspire further action in that industry and beyond it."" Next up for the union are 5,200 Mercedes-Benz workers at an SUV plant in Vance, Alabama. Workers at the facility earlier this month filed NLRB paperwork for a formal election that is scheduled for May 13 through May 17. ""We're going to carry this fight on to Mercedes and everywhere else,"" Fain told VW workers Friday night following the historic vote. ""So, thank you all, thank you all for your fight, for your work. And let's get to it. Let's go to work. And let's win more for the working class all over this nation."" Top of the list of likely impacts from organizing efforts at VW is labor costs. UAW organizers used the record contracts with the Detroit automakers to gain support for the union in Chattanooga. UBS said in an investor note that VW has a relatively low operating margin in the U.S., and ""substantial pay increases could undermine the profitability outlook of the local US operations."" But for the Big Three Detroit automakers — and their shareholders — the VW organizing drive could be a positive. GM, Ford and Stellantis have higher all-in labor costs than non-organized automakers such as VW. Depending on contract details, labor pushes like VW and others could somewhat even that playing field. ""Overall, given the substantial pay gap between UAW-unionized workers (Detroit-3) and non-unionized workers in the southern states, it can be assumed that the vote will lead to more upwards pressure on wages for VW over time,"" UBS said in an investor note. Before last year's contracts with the Detroit automakers, all-in labor costs for Ford, GM and Stellantis were between $63 and $67 an hour, according to industry experts. That compared with workers at non-domestic, or transplant, automakers such as VW at $55 an hour. Those costs included all benefits and health care costs. Still, there's no guarantee that VW – a much smaller automaker in the U.S. – will agree to the same terms as the traditional domestic automakers. Fain on Friday said ""the real fight begins now,"" referring to the expected negotiations between the union and VW. The VW vote was widely expected to be the easiest in the UAW's organizing plans, as the union had already established a presence there following votes that narrowly failed in 2019 and 2014. The margin of success in Chattanooga could bode well for UAW efforts at other automakers, according to Sharon Block, a professor at Harvard Law School and former DOL and NLRB official. ""I think it's really hard to overestimate the importance of this moment and to overestimate just how strategic the UAW has been in this campaign, which I think suggests that this is not the last time that we're going to be talking about a UAW victory in an auto plant in the South,"" Block said. Though opposition during the VW vote was sparse, the most notable instance came a day before the election began, in the form of a letter from six Republican governors condemning the UAW's push to organize automotive factories in the South and warning of potential layoffs. ""We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy — in fact, in this year already, all of the UAW automakers have announced layoffs,"" read the statement, which was signed by governors in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Block called the letter an ""empty threat"" and ""cynical ploy"" but noted that increased labor costs can result in fewer jobs. Fewer jobs in the U.S. automotive industry also means fewer eligible workers for union membership. Membership with the UAW at the Detroit automakers has significantly fallen in recent decades, as free trade agreements allowed automakers to produce vehicles for cheaper elsewhere. UAW membership, largely made up of autoworkers but also including workers in agriculture and aerospace, peaked at 1.5 million in 1979. As of last year, the union's membership was 370,239 workers – down 3.3% from 2022 and 75% from its peak. Workers from the Detroit automakers only made up roughly 150,000 of that 2023 total. – CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2024-04-22,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/22/uaw-vw-organizing-drive-what-investors-should-know.html?&qsearchterm="

UBS, Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Credit Suisse were fined a combined total of 344 million euros ($390 million), the commission said in a statement Thursday. The investigation, focused on the trading of G-10 currencies, revealed that foreign exchange traders in these five banks discussed sensitive information and trading plans. They occasionally coordinated their trading plans via a professional online chatroom called Sterling Lads, the commission said. Four of the banks' fines — UBS, Barclays, RBS and HSBC — were discounted by 10% as they acknowledged their participation in the cartel. Credit Suisse did not benefit from this reduction as it did not cooperate with authorities, the commission said. Its fine was reduced by 4% to reflect that the bank was not liable for all aspects of the case, however. UBS ultimately does not have to pay any fine as the bank received ""full immunity"" for revealing the existence of the cartel.

""I think China is cheap. If you look at the performance of China this year, on a relative basis, it has actually underperformed by about 40% against both the European indices as well as the American indices,"" Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday. As of Tuesday's market close, China's CSI 300 index, which tracks the largest mainland-listed stocks, has fallen nearly 5% for the year. In Hong Kong, where many of China's tech titans are listed, the Hang Seng index has plummeted more than 14% in the same period. In comparison, the S&P 500 on Wall Street rose to a new record close — its 69th in 2021 — as recently as Monday. Over in Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 has gained more than 22% for 2021 as of its Tuesday close. ""From a valuations perspective, from a positioning perspective, China certainly looks very, very attractive,"" Tay said. He warned, however, that the Chinese market is unlikely to recover in the next three months due to a ""distinct lack of catalysts"" presently. He cited the need for China's property space to settle before the market can turn around. Investors have largely shunned the Chinese real estate sector this year amid concerns over defaults as developers faced a credit crunch. In December, debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group slipped into default after failing to confirm payment of a debt obligation. ""We do think that things actually starting to turn around but it's just that, you know, on the issuers front, on the Chinese high-yield front, you're probably still going to get some news, some negative news on a couple of developers blowing up, filing for defaults, filing for bankruptcies,"" Tay said. Such negative developments are likely to hurt sentiment, he warned: ""If sentiment is fragile in the Chinese market right now, any small negative news is likely to be amplified and become big, and that in turn is going to actually affect the market as a whole.""

""The policy risk tightening, we do think that most of that is actually over and done with,"" the chief investment officer explained. ""What you're going to get going forward is probably fine tuning of the measures and not, you know, an unleashing of an overhaul of the system similar to what we had in the tuition industry in July this year."" Another factor that is set to give Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks a relative boost is expectations for a weakening in the yuan next year. ""The renminbi has been very, very strong,"" Tay said. ""The government has actually stressed on a couple of occasions that they're not quite comfortable with the outperformance of the renminbi vis a vis the other currencies over the last six months.""

Analysts had expected income to come in at $967 million for the three-month period, according to Refinitiv. It comes after the Swiss bank reported net income of $2.1 billion for the third quarter of last year. Double-digit profit growth in UBS' wealth management and asset management divisions contributed to the quarterly performance. The bank also revealed that it would restart buying back its shares. It announced a new three-year program in which it plans to purchase up to 4 billion Swiss francs ($4.5 billion) of shares, $1 billion of which will be purchased during the first quarter of 2021. Buybacks offer a way for firms to return cash to shareholders — along with dividends — and usually coincide with a company's stock pushing higher as shares get scarcer. At a time when banks have been discouraged from paying dividends, UBS also announced it will propose a 2020 dividend of $0.37 per share. The results are the first under the leadership of Ralph Hamers, who took over as the new chief executive officer on Nov. 1.

"UBS sees 'short-lived' strength for gold, expects prices to drop to $1,600 by year-end","Gold prices have been buoyed in recent weeks as investors seek safe-havens amid fears of Russia invading Ukraine, but in the longer term, UBS Investment Bank's Joni Teves predicts that recent strength in gold prices will be ""short-lived.""Spot gold recently crossed the $1,900 level, last sitting at $1,908.13 per ounce in the morning of Asia trading hours on Tuesday. That's sharply higher than levels around $1,800 seen in early February.Looking ahead, Teves said the gold market is expected to revert back to focusing on macro drivers such as real rates, U.S. Federal Reserve policy as well as the growth outlook. ","Gold prices have been buoyed in recent weeks as investors seek safe-havens amid fears of Russia invading Ukraine, but in the longer term, UBS Investment Bank's Joni Teves predicts that recent strength in gold prices will be ""short-lived."" She spoke to CNBC on Monday, before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered forces into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, after he announced the Kremlin will recognize their independence.  Spot gold recently crossed the $1,900 level, last sitting at $1,908.13 per ounce in the morning of Asia trading hours on Tuesday. That's sharply higher than levels around $1,800 seen in early February. The latest escalation in Ukraine raised doubts over the potential for a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing crisis. U.S. President Joe Biden has since ordered sanctions on the separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union also vowing additional measures. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe investment during times of uncertainty. Looking ahead, Teves said the gold market is expected to revert back to focusing on macro drivers such as real rates, U.S. Federal Reserve policy as well as the growth outlook. In fact, UBS sees gold prices falling to $1,600 per ounce by the end of 2022. ""An environment where real rates are rising and the Fed is tightening policy does provide a negative backdrop for gold,"" she said. ""We do think that the strength should ultimately … be short-lived."" As the end of the current quarter approaches, the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates at its March meeting to cool inflationary pressures, and Teves said that's likely to put pressure on gold. Expectations for higher interest rates tend to push yields of assets such as U.S. Treasurys higher, potentially lowering the attractiveness of a non-yielding asset such as gold.

Here's HSBC forecast Still, she acknowledged that the upside risks for gold are rising. ""I think the key risk here is if we start to see reallocation into gold, with the expectation that although real rates are moving higher they are likely to remain in negative territory, and therefore an allocation to gold remains attractive,"" the strategist said.

"UBS first-quarter profit up 14%, but CEO 'very disappointed' with hit from Archegos scandal","The Swiss lender said revenues were $774 million lower as a result of the Archegos hedge fund's collapse.UBS CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC the bank was ""very disappointed"" by the loss and had started a review into its prime brokerage business.The bank's net income for the first quarter came in at $1.8 billion, beating analyst expectations and up 14% from a year earlier.","In this article LONDON — UBS reported on Tuesday net income of $1.8 billion for the first quarter of 2021, as it revealed a hit to earnings from the scandal involving Archegos Capital. UBS shares were down almost 2% in early European trading hours. The Swiss bank said revenues were $774 million lower as a result of the default by the Archegos hedge fund, which collapsed last month after taking on too much risk. The U.S.-based family office was a client of UBS' prime brokerage business. UBS said Tuesday it had exited all exposure to Archegos and any related losses in the second quarter would be ""immaterial"" for the bank. A number of banks have been affected by the scandal, including Credit Suisse, which reported last week a net loss for the quarter on the back of a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.8 billion) hit from the collapse of the same U.S. hedge fund. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Tuesday, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank was ""very disappointed"" by the hit. ""We are taking it very seriously. We have started a very detailed review of the different prime brokers' relationships that we have, the family offices' relationship that we have as well, the risk management processes that we have, in order to really get the lessons learned and make sure we implement them so that going forward it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Hamers added that the prime brokerage business was ""strategic"" and that its capabilities support the wider business, but nonetheless UBS needed to learn from what happened with Archegos. UBS' net income for the first quarter marked a 14% increase from a year earlier. Analysts had expected the figure to come in at $1.6 billion over the period, according to Refinitiv. Other highlights for the quarter: Hamers said the bank had seen ""continuous heightened client activity"" this quarter. ""Actually performance was really strong across wealth management, asset management, the investment bank and also the activities here in Switzerland,"" he told CNBC. ""So from that perspective actually a real, well balanced and strong quarter if it weren't for the loss that we also had to take, but even after the loss, we performed at a 18.2% return on CET1, which is a really good result."" Going forward, UBS said that revenues in the second quarter will be affected by ""seasonal factors,"" such as lower client activity compared to the first three months of the year. The Swiss bank expects a positive effect from higher asset prices, but warned that there is ""continued uncertainty"" about the economic recovery, which could impact its next earnings. ""We should all be aware there is a lot of optimism in the market and clearly there is a lot of good news that has come to the market, but I would also want to look at some of the challenges that we see. Will the pandemic be over? That is the question. Will vaccination continue the way it is? How will the economy truly recover?""

"Archegos hit to UBS stuns investors as shares slide","UBS shares dropped by almost 3% in mid-morning European trade, after reporting that it took a $774 million hit in the first quarter as a result of Archegos' default.The Swiss bank waited until its results day to inform markets about its exposure to the firm, a move that has sparked questions about transparency in the industry.","In this article LONDON — UBS surprised market participants on Tuesday, announcing that profits had taken a hit from the Archegos Capital saga — almost a month after the collapse of the U.S. hedge fund. The Swiss bank waited until its results day to inform markets about its exposure to the firm, a move that has sparked questions about transparency in the industry. ""What I am surprised about here is the fact that they didn't disclose this earlier,"" Storm Uru, a manager at Liontrust Global Dividend Fund, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. UBS shares dropped by almost 3% in mid-morning European trade, after reporting that it took a $774 million hit in the first quarter as a result of Archegos' default. Maria Rivas, senior vice president at DBRS Morningstar, said the announcement from UBS ""was surprising given that the bank had not made any indication to the market on this issue before."" Different banks have been hit by the collapse of Archegos, which took on too much risk and defaulted on margin calls in March. Credit Suisse, Nomura, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been caught in the crossfire, although some managed to exit their positions sooner than others. For Credit Suisse, for instance, its involvement in Archegos meant it took a hit of 4.4 billion Swiss francs ($4.8 billion), which significantly impacted the bank's performance in the first quarter of the year. Credit Suisse also said last week that it expects to take an additional loss in the second quarter of around 600 million Swiss francs. ""UBS took a similar approach to Morgan Stanley and reported the impact on the announcement of results,"" Rivas said. Morgan Stanley was among the named banks that quickly sold their exposure to Archegos. Nonetheless it reported two weeks ago a $644 million loss from a ""credit event,"" as well as $267 million in related trading losses. ""Whilst unexpected, UBS hit from the prime brokerage client default dragged the overall Investment Banking division performance down, but the impact was more than offset by strong revenue performance,"" Rivas added. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Tuesday, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank was ""very disappointed"" by the hit. ""We are taking it very seriously. We have started a very detailed review of the different prime brokers' relationships that we have, the family offices' relationship that we have as well, the risk management processes that we have, in order to really get the lessons learned and make sure we implement them so that going forward it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Other banks are also investigating what went wrong with Archegos. Uru from Liontrust, who indicated that he had no holdings of UBS, believes further transparency in the future could put an end to some of the issues in banking. ""Clearly this had had an impact on UBS and maybe as we move forward based on stronger governance transparency, maybe we won't have these issues,"" he said.  ",2021-04-27,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/archegos-hit-to-ubs-stuns-investors-as-shares-slide.html?&qsearchterm="
"The Indian rupee has had a stable run this year, but UBS expects it will be 'short-lived'","UBS strategists expect the Indian currency to weaken to 77 per dollar by the end of the year — more than 5% weaker than current levels — and depreciate further to 79.5 by September 2022.The rupee's resilience has primarily been because of two reasons: first, foreign fund flows into the Indian market and second, the Reserve Bank of India's management of the volatility, according to Gaurang Somaiya from Motilal Oswal.British bank HSBC expects the rupee to hold up ""relatively well"" in a stronger dollar environment as persistent FDI inflows and better foreign-exchange reserves will help the currency withstand external headwinds.","In this article The Indian rupee has been one of the most stable currencies in Asia-Pacific this year, but its stability is expected to be short-lived, according to UBS. Strategists from the Swiss investment bank said in a note dated Aug. 25 that they expect the Indian currency to weaken to 77 per dollar by the end of the year — more than 5% weaker than current levels — and depreciate further to 79.5 by September 2022. ""We see the year-to-date INR stability as short-lived,"" UBS said, adding that a retreat in U.S. bond yields lent stability to currencies like the rupee. The rupee changed hands at around 72.98 per dollar on Friday, strengthening some 0.19% from January levels and appreciating from levels around 74.11 last month. The rupee's resilience has been primarily driven by two factors, according to Gaurang Somaiya, a foreign-exchange analyst at the Mumbai-based diversified financial services firm Motilal Oswal. ""First, consistent fund flows was positive for the rupee and second was the [Reserve Bank of India] bought dollars to build its reserves and prepare itself for any volatility,"" he told CNBC. Somaiya added that fund flows were not only led by the foreign institutional investors but also through a consistent stream of foreign direct investments. FDI equity inflow into India grew 168% on-year to $17.57 billion between April and June — the first quarter in India's fiscal year 2022. That refers to foreign money invested into Indian markets as well as businesses and is free of debt. ""Fund flows have been one of the major reasons that helped the rupee gain steadily,"" Somaiya said. He pointed out that between August last year and now, the rupee has been stuck in a relatively broad range of 72 and 75 against the dollar. That suggests the RBI has been ""very active in managing the volatility of the rupee,"" using its interventions to build up its foreign exchange reserves to near all-time highs, he said. Latest data showed the RBI had about $616.9 billion in foreign exchange reserves as on Aug. 20. Somaiya said he expects the rupee to appreciate in the near term, following sharp gains in the domestic stock market. He predicted the currency could appreciate to levels near 72.20 against the dollar by the end of the year. In 2022, he expects the rupee to trade around the 73.50 to 74 level as the U.S. currency strengthens. Last year, India recorded a current account surplus for the first time in over a decade due to a collapse in domestic demand for imports as a result of the pandemic. That implied the value of incoming goods, services and investments into India was lower than the amount that left the country. In the first three months of this year, India's current account deficit widened to $8.1 billion, or 1% of GDP, as the economy slowly recovered. UBS strategists said India's quarterly current account balance has deteriorated rapidly from last year, driven by a rebound in oil prices. ""Given our expectations for India's current account deficit to persist in a 1-1.5% range into 2022, we expect the [rupee] to come under pressure when US yields start to rebound toward 2% by year-end,"" they said. British investment bank HSBC has a more positive view on the Indian currency. It expects the rupee to reach 73 against the dollar by year-end and says the currency will likely end flat with its end-2020 level. In the longer term, the bank expects modest weakness where the rupee could weaken to 75 against the dollar. HSBC expects the rupee to hold up ""relatively well"" in a stronger dollar environment as persistent FDI inflows and better foreign-exchange reserves will help the currency withstand external headwinds, Madan Reddy, Asia foreign-exchange strategist at HSBC Global Research, told CNBC. ""The uncertainty around slowing sequential global growth and the Fed's policy normalisation should therefore leave the [rupee] as an outperformer in Asia,"" he said. U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell last month indicated that the central bank is likely to begin withdrawing some of its easy-money policies before the end of the year, though he still sees interest rate hikes off in the distance. Reddy said the likelihood of tighter monetary conditions in the U.S. and a re-widening of India's current account deficit point to a higher dollar/rupee pair. But, he added, excessive weakness in the rupee is less likely as the RBI would eventually remove excess liquidity conditions from the economy and restrain inflation expectations. He pointed out the central bank's foreign-exchange purchases in recent years have helped suppress longer-term depreciation expectations among local traders. ""In our view, the RBI's FX policy will continue to remain a key driver of rupee's performance,"" Reddy said, adding that he sees little incentive for the central bank to tolerate the rupee's strength as long as capital inflows are not broad-based. ""For now, the RBI seems to be comfortable with [dollar/rupee] oscillating within its year-to-date trading range of 72.5-75.5,"" he said. Motilal Oswal's Somaiya added that domestic factors like growth recovery are more in favor of a stronger rupee, but global factors could cap gains against the dollar.       ",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/06/indian-rupee-inr-outlook.html?&qsearchterm="

Pre-tax profit for the period rose 92% to $2.6 billion, in what UBS described as its best third-quarter result in a decade.It comes after an 11% drop in profit for the second quarter, as the global banking industry felt the full effect of the coronavirus pandemic.","In this article LONDON — The world's largest wealth manager, UBS, reported a jump in net income to $2.1 billion for the third quarter on Tuesday, easily beating analyst expectations. It marks a 99% jump from the same period a year earlier. ""It is very difficult not to be happy with this set of numbers because they are coming from a great contribution from all business units,"" CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Tuesday. Analysts had expected the Swiss bank and asset manager to report $1.5 billion of net income for the third quarter, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. It comes after an 11% drop in profit for the second quarter, as the global banking industry felt the full effect of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We speak a lot about stimulus and Covid-related matters, but the geopolitical uncertainties in Europe, and also in the Sino-U.S. relationship, (are) still there and they're there to stay so we shouldn't underestimate that,"" Ermotti added. UBS said pre-tax profit for the third quarter rose 92% to $2.6 billion, in what it described as its best third-quarter result in a decade. The Swiss lender's results are the first of Europe's banks. Analysts are expecting a better quarter for the sector following a tough first half off the back of the coronavirus outbreak and economic crisis. UBS said loan loss provisions for the period came in at $89 million, significantly lower than the amounts booked in the first and second quarters. It also said it planned to pay its delayed dividend from 2019 in November of this year, and had set aside $1.5 billion for share repurchases which it expects to start next year. Here are other highlights of the third quarter: Pre-tax profit in UBS' investment bank rose 268%, on the back of market volatility in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. While its wealth management division posted an 18% rise in profit before tax, and total invested assets hit an all-time high of $2.75 billion. The bank attributed its results to ongoing strong client activity and the ""benefits of a well-diversified business model with broad regional mix."" Speaking to CNBC, Ermotti said: ""The amount of visibility is very limited, but this has not really changed in the last few years and months. I think what we are doing is staying very agile and staying very focused on our plan."" From a geographical standpoint, Ermotti also said that the U.S. and Asia ""offer bigger and greater growth opportunities"" than Europe, adding that the latter needed to implement more structural reforms and regain competitiveness.

"UBS says stocks have 5% to 10% further to run, but watch out for this yield level","In a monthly investment call Tuesday, U.K. CIO Caroline Simmons said analysts had a particular preference for emerging markets in Asia and China in particular.She also backed cyclical and value stocks — those whose performance will coincide with economic recovery or those with valuations lower than their financial position would justify.","UBS Global Wealth Management sees 5% to 10% upside for global stock markets, with emerging markets, financials, energy stocks and small caps best placed to capitalize. In a monthly investment call Tuesday, U.K. CIO Caroline Simmons said analysts had a particular preference for emerging markets in Asia and China in particular. She also backed cyclical and value stocks — those whose performance will coincide with economic recovery or those with valuations lower than their financial position would justify. This is based on expectations that the economic recovery will broaden out and accelerate over the course of the year, continuing to support a rotation from the high-flying growth sectors such as technology into sectors that benefit from an acceleration of industrial production and rising inflation. ""Small caps tend to be more cyclical in terms of their sector makeup than larger caps, so they are more convergent to the economic recovery, and their valuations remain attractive,"" Simmons said on the call. ""The price-to-book ratio of the MSCI Small Cap (index) relative to the MSCI World is nearly two standard deviations below the long run average, so the small caps, despite having already performed quite strongly since November, remain attractively priced."" She noted that financials had underperformed the S&P 500 by around 5% since the end of 2019, but have recently begun to make a comeback as the rotation to value and inflation expectations gathered pace. A recent rise in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield and other bond yields around the world have triggered volatility in equity markets, as investors began to question the valuations of growth-based sectors susceptible to higher interest rates. The 10-year yield was hovering at around 1.6209% on Thursday morning in Europe, but UBS forecasts that it will reach around 2% by the end of the year. ""Higher yields and steeper yield curves generally are more helpful for financials. They help their net interest margins and they also generally see an improvement in non-performing loans,"" Simmons said. She added that financial earnings would benefit if provisions for bad loans are seen to be excessive compared to the reality of the loan losses, while valuations remain low relative to the rest of the market. Meanwhile energy stocks, as of Tuesday afternoon's call, had unperformed the S&P 500 by around 33% since the end of 2019, and UBS believes there is considerable room for a catchup. The Swiss lender forecasts Brent crude prices to hit $75 per barrel by the end of the year, and Simmons noted that energy companies are offering strong cash flows and dividend yields. International benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $63.60 on Thursday morning. While rising bond yields have caused some jitters in the market, Simmons argued that a continued climb would not necessarily spell the end for equity gains. ""In the past 25 years, there have been 10 periods in which the 10-year Treasury yield rose by more than 100 basis points, and in all of those instances, global equities delivered flat or positive returns,"" she pointed out. In a letter to investors Monday, UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele noted that rising inflation expectations also tend to reduce equity risk premiums, though he added that ""all else equal, higher yields do present a headwind for stock valuations. Haefele highlighted that despite rising yields, current valuations are above the long-term average for the equity risk premium. An equity risk premium is the return generated on a particular asset over and above the risk-free rate of return. ""We don't think that inflation or yields are a risk. What I will say is that if you get yields moving significantly higher, maybe above 2.25% on the U.S., then that does potentially start to have implications for the valuations of the equities, and then it would become a discussion about whether the earnings growth is strong enough to offset a valuation impact or not,"" Simmons said.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/ubs-says-stocks-have-5percent-to-10percent-further-to-run-but-watch-out-for-this-yield-level.html?&qsearchterm="

That assumes e-commerce sales rise to represent 27% of total retail sales, up from 18% today.","Although the pace of store closures has slowed from its 2019 peak, don't expect the reprieve to last long, according to a new UBS report that suggests America still has far too much retail space per capita. At the end of last year, there were 115,000 shopping centers — a figure that includes strip centers, malls, outlet and other lifestyle centers — across the U.S., compared with 112,000 in 2010 and 90,000 in 2000, UBS found in an analysis using data from the International Council of Shopping Centers. That equates to about 59 square feet of shopping center space per U.S. household, which is slightly less than 62 square feet in 2010, UBS said. But it's still well above the 55 square feet of space per household in 2000, and 49 square feet in 1990, analysts Michael Lasser and Jay Sole explained. UBS is estimating that about 80,000 retail stores, which is 9% of total stores, will shut across the country by 2026. That assumes e-commerce sales rise to represent 27% of total retail sales by then, up from 18% today. ""An enduring legacy of the pandemic is that online penetration rose sharply,"" Lasser said in a note to clients. ""We expect that it will continue to increase, which will drive further rationalization of retail stores, especially as some of the unique support measures from the government subside."" Even though more Americans are increasingly ordering everything from milk and bread to desk chairs to sneakers on the internet, store openings are outpacing closures for the first time in years. Many businesses are seizing the moment to take advantage of cheaper rents and ample vacant space to pick from. The growth largely stems from retailers that sell in beauty, grocery and discount goods, including Ulta, Dollar General, TJX and Lidl, which are anticipating a strong post-pandemic rebound in visits to stores. U.S. retailers have announced 3,169 store closures and 3,535 store openings so far this year, according to data complied by Coresight Research. The firm tracked 9,832 closures in 2019 — the highest it's seen since it started following this data. That figure fell to 8,741 in 2020. UBS said the retail industry has been supported recently by government stimulus and by consumers shifting their dollars to goods from services, with travel and other entertainment events on pause due to the pandemic. But it said those trends are going to be short-lived, leading to a predicted downturn in retail sales, which will result in an uptick in retail closures. UBS anticipates the most closures will be found among retailers that sell clothing and accessories in the years ahead. The firm is forecasting about 21,000 closures from this sector by 2026, with many of the shuttered stores located in enclosed shopping malls. Office-supplies and sporting-goods businesses are also forecast to be among the hardest hit. Closures are anticipated to be the most modest in home improvement, grocery and auto parts retailing, as these categories are less susceptible to harm with the rise of e-commerce, UBS said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2021-04-05,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/05/store-closures-ubs-predicts-80000-stores-will-go-dark-by-2026.html?&qsearchterm="
"The UK is in 'pole position' for market recovery despite gloomy economic outlook, UBS says","U.K. GDP saw its sharpest contraction since 1979 in the first quarter, and the balance-of-trade deficit widened to £21.1 billion ($26.4 billion).U.K. stocks currently trade at a 19% discount to the MSCI World index, versus an average of 7% since 2002, UBS strategists pointed out in a research note Wednesday.S&P Global has cut its forecast for U.K. GDP in 2020 to an 8.1% contraction, warning of a ""perfect storm"" if Britain suffers a second wave of coronavirus infections and fails to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement.","Although the U.K. faces a gloomy economic picture, UBS believes the country's assets are ""heavily undervalued"" and best placed to capitalize on the Covid-19 recovery. U.K. GDP saw its sharpest contraction since 1979 in the first quarter, and the balance-of-trade deficit widened to £21.1 billion ($26.4 billion). However, strategists at the Swiss bank suggested that a promised £5 billion of government infrastructure spending and several key market dynamics place the U.K. in ""pole position"" to outperform. ""We see the UK as benefiting in an upside scenario for the global economic recovery, among other markets, including U.S. mid-caps, German industrials, and consumer brands,"" said Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management. ""In particular, we see sterling as the most notable beneficiary of the vulnerability of the U.S. dollar, which we expect to fall as safe-haven flows reverse and as political uncertainty mounts ahead of the November U.S. presidential election."" U.K. stocks currently trade at a 19% discount to the MSCI World index, versus an average of 7% since 2002, UBS strategists pointed out in a research note Wednesday, suggesting that this implies considerable upside potential over the next 12 months. Net earnings-per-share (EPS) revisions, the balance of upward and downward revisions to analyst forecasts, have been improving on the back of rising oil prices, but stock performance has remained sluggish. EPS refers to a company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding. UBS believes that sterling is second only to the Japanese yen among G-10 currencies in terms of undervaluation relative to the dollar, with strategists estimating its purchasing power parity (PPP) with the greenback is 1.54, against a current exchange rate of 1.25. PPP uses the prices of particular goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of currencies in various countries. The note also highlighted that some value stocks (those which trade at a low price relative to their fundamentals) and cyclical sectors (those which generally track economic performance) which have upside potential in the Covid-19 economic recovery align well with the U.K. equity market. In particular, the FTSE 100 has a 40% cumulative exposure to value sectors such as banks, basic materials and energy.

S&P Global on Wednesday cut its forecast for U.K. GDP in 2020 to an 8.1% contraction, warning of a ""perfect storm"" if Britain experiences a second wave of coronavirus infections and fails to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the European Union. The U.K. has passed the June 30 deadline to request an extension to the current transition period beyond the end of 2020, meaning its future trading relationship with the bloc will have to be determined over the next six months. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmeiding noted Thursday that despite an extension being off the table, the tone from British and European leaders has softened, with both sides floating possible compromises over governance, level playing field provisions and politically sensitive fisheries. But despite signs of progress, Berenberg does not expect a deal before year-end. ""Instead, we expect the two sides to agree on some modest stopgap measures in order to prevent a disorderly hard exit,"" Schmeiding said. ""Instead of one big cliff edge, where the U.K.-EU economic relationship suddenly shifts from open single market rules to the much more restrictive World Trade Organisation rules for trade, we expect the two sides to see to it that the switch occurs in a series of smaller steps."" S&P Global now assumes that a ""core"" trade agreement will be reached, rather than the comprehensive accord once hoped for by the markets, and suggested that the switch to this regime will dampen the 2021 rebound and drag on growth in the coming years. The ratings agency now expects that the U.K. economy will be around 3% smaller in 2022 than initially projected before the pandemic. Despite the potential headwinds, however, Haefele's UBS team believes the monetary and political risks are ""overdone"" and overstating the concerns that no agreement is reached, owing to a clear incentive for both sides to avoid such an outcome. ""We also believe markets have been exaggerating the risk of the Bank of England reducing rates into negative territory, a potential drag on the pound,"" the UBS note added. The Bank of England revealed last month that it had been assessing the impact of negative rates, but Governor Andrew Bailey confirmed that this was not an immediate consideration, and the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) did not discuss it at June's policy meeting. ""As these risks subside, we expect the pound to regain ground and investment into the U.K. to pick up,"" Haefele concluded.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/ubs-uk-in-pole-position-for-market-recovery-despite-gloomy-economic-outlook.html?&qsearchterm="

Here are some other key metrics from the results: ""We saw a huge pick up in client engagement, despite the logistical challenges. We see that clients are more and more looking for advice,"" Sergio Ermotti, UBS's chief executive officer, told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe. Turbulence in the markets helped UBS's investment bank post the biggest jump in operating profit, across the all the business divisions, on the year before. Operating profit before tax rose to $709 million from $207 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Within investment banking, UBS attributed a 44% rise in revenue in its global markets division to ""significantly higher volumes and volatility, particularly in Foreign Exchange, Rates and Cash Equities revenues, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on client activity levels."" Its global wealth management division also increased its operating profit before tax over the last year to $1.2 billion from $863 million. However, invested assets fell to $2.3 billion. The results come at a time of significant pressure for banks, as the coronavirus pandemic has brought the global economy to a standstill. The Swiss bank said the coronavirus had ""dramatically changed the global economic outlook,"" adding that it foresees disruption to many businesses and higher unemployment as a result. Given this, UBS is expecting higher levels of credit loss expenses for the financial sector. Speaking to CNBC Tuesday, Ermotti said it was ""very difficult to make predictions about any quarters going forward."" ""January, February and March were all profitable months,"" he said, adding that the bank will seek to be ""flexible"" in dealing with upcoming challenges.  UBS said earlier this month that it will suspend half of its 2019 dividend payout until later this year, after pressure from Swiss regulator FINMA.

Ermotti, who joined UBS in 2011 and became chief executive in 2014, believes that investors will be shifting their portfolio positions in the runup to that vote. ""Investor survey(s), client survey(s) that we do tells us that most likely we will see, running into the elections and after the elections, a shift in their asset allocation,"" Ermotti told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore.

""Forget about the U.S. elections or fiscal stimulus — restrictions creeping higher is the single biggest near term risk to the outlook,"" economist Arend Kapteyn wrote in a note dated Oct. 19. ""If countries start to impose 'circuit breaker' lockdowns that last just several weeks, that may already be enough to turn a positive (fourth quarter) growth rate negative,"" he said. The phrase ""circuit breaker"" has become popular in the U.K. and refers to a short but strict lockdown intended to break the chain of infection. There have been more than 40.6 million cases of the coronavirus worldwide, and at least 1.12 million people have died, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University. Various economies including France and the Netherlands have tightened measures in recent weeks, Kapteyn wrote. UBS has been tracking coronavirus mobility restrictions in 42 geographies weekly since March on a scale of one to 10. According to the bank, if restrictiveness increases by one point for an entire quarter, gross domestic product will decline by 6 percentage points. Over the last month, the U.K. and the Netherlands have increased from a ""moderate"" rating of 2.5 to an ""intermediate"" level of 5.

"UBS gives 3 reasons for why the Chinese yuan is 'attractive' right now","UBS Global Wealth Management's Dominic Schnider says ""the stars are really lining up"" for the Chinese yuan to strengthen against the dollar.The Chinese yuan has seen a significant strengthening so far this year, as data releases continue to show the country powering ahead of the rest of its peers globally in recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.","In this article SINGAPORE — The Chinese yuan is set to see further gains in the short term, according to UBS Global Wealth Management's Dominic Schnider. ""The stars are really lining up for a stronger (Chinese yuan),"" Schnider, head of commodities and Asia-Pacific foreign exchange/macro at UBS told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday. The Chinese currency has strengthened significantly so far this year, and data releases continue to show the country powering ahead of its global peers in its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday morning Singapore time, the onshore Chinese yuan sat at 6.6891 against the greenback, nearly 4% stronger since the start of the year. The Chinese currency's offshore counterpart — which trades more freely than the onshore yuan — traded at 6.689 per dollar. It has also gained almost 4% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year. China's onshore yuan, also known as the renminbi, trades within a narrow band stipulated by the central bank, which steps in to buy or sell the yuan when it deviates outside that range, in order to stem volatility. For its part, UBS Global Wealth Management has a short-term target of 6.6 for the Chinese yuan against the dollar. Schinder said there are three factors that will likely to strengthen the currency: economic growth, balance of payments and inflows. China's economy is growing at a faster pace than its Western peers, he said. China said its gross domestic product grew 4.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, in a sign that the economy was picking up steam again. In comparison, other economies such as the U.S. and countries in Europe are not expecting year-on-year expansion until the first half of 2021. ""The U.S. and Europe are already growing from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, but they are lagging China by a wide margin,"" Schnider told CNBC in a follow-up email. This ""speaks in favor"" of foreign direct investments as well as risk assets in China, such as its stock market, and the yuan. Secondly, China's current account surplus could grow to almost 2.8% of GDP in 2020 compared to 1% of GDP in 2019, the analyst said. ""A growing current account surplus, due to stronger exports and a smaller service balance deficit, tends to favor a stronger currency in the quarters ahead,"" he said. On the subject of inflows, Schnider said there are ""two angles"" to the issue. First, the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in global bond benchmarks is expected to ""trigger"" inflows of between $100 billion and $150 billion over the next 12 to 18 months, he said. Next, China has a ""solid yield carry"" compared to the U.S., he said, referring to a strategy known as carry trade, where investors make a profit on the difference between interest paid and interest earned. This can be achieved by borrowing in a low-yielding currency (such as the U.S. dollar) to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. ""Even volatility adjusted, the (yuan) yield carry is attractive,"" the analyst said. With none of the countries in the Group of 10 currently offering a yield that is attractive as China, Schnider said, portfolio inflows into the country are set to remain strong and hence, strengthen the yuan. However, the upcoming U.S. elections could still impact those predictions. ""I think a lot of the changes would ... be dependent on the development here,"" he said, adding that the topic of greenback weakness is expected to linger into 2021 — a factor that may be reflected in the dollar-yuan pair.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/ubs-gives-3-reasons-for-why-the-chinese-yuan-is-attractive-right-now.html?&qsearchterm="
"Covid cases in U.S. could be near zero in 6 months, UBS economist says","UBS had originally estimated that the number of coronavirus infections in the U.S. would approach zero by the end of 2021.But this week's vaccine news has made the bank bring that forecast forward by six months.Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS, believes U.S. policymakers will disappoint markets by providing a lower-than-expected stimulus package.","In this article LONDON — The latest coronavirus vaccine developments have brightened the outlook for the U.S. economy, with UBS economists boosting their GDP forecasts for the country.  Pfizer and BioNTech announced Monday that their Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing the infectious disease. The announcement fueled optimism that the pandemic could come to an end sooner rather than later, driving up stock markets globally. UBS had originally estimated that the number of coronavirus infections in the U.S. would approach zero by the end of 2021, but the vaccine news has made the bank bring that forecast forward by six months. ""We might get a situation where reported cases of Covid in the United States fall very close to zero in Q2 (second quarter) of next year. That six month difference, that two-quarter difference matters a lot, it means an extra 1 to 1.25 percentage point gain in GDP next year,"" Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Thursday. He added that the vaccine news ""was very encouraging"" because the efficacy rate came in much higher than analysts were anticipating. The United States has experienced more than 10 million Covid-19 cases since the pandemic started. The country has seen record highs this week in terms of coronavirus hospitalizations and daily infections, with 153,496 cases on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University. This comes as speculation mounts on whether the U.S. economy will be shut down once again. An advisor to President-elect Joe Biden has said that closing businesses for four to six weeks could help reduce the number of infections and get the economy on track until a vaccine is approved and distributed. With cases surging in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot asked residents on Thursday to cancel Thanksgiving plans and stay indoors. Carpenter's comments differ to the caution portrayed by experts such as White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. He warned on Thursday that a vaccine may not be enough to help eradicate the disease. ""I doubt we are going to eradicate this. I think we need to plan that this is something we may need to maintain control over chronically. It may be something that becomes endemic, that we have to just be careful about,"" he said. The performance of the U.S. economy in 2021 will also depend on how much fiscal stimulus is approved. Talks between Democrats and Republicans have not yielded a deal, and there's more uncertainty in the aftermath of the presidential election. Carpenter believes U.S. policymakers will disappoint markets by providing a lower-than-expected support package. ""We are actually a little bit pessimistic here relative to where the market is, so we have written down about a $450 billion package that comes in Q1 (first quarter) next year,"" he said. In speaking with clients, he said markets are expecting $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus. UBS assumes that Republicans will retain control of the Senate. If the Senate were to be led by  Democrats, the bank believes the stimulus could be near $1 trillion.

That's the ""future of food,"" according to a UBS analyst, who sees diet personalization as the next plant-based meat. Personalized nutrition could generate annual revenues as high as $64 billion by 2040, the firm said. Plus, big-name companies such as Apple, Uber and Amazon could benefit from the massive growth opportunity. ""With heightened health awareness among consumers, yet also more people suffering from ailments which are attributable to poor nutrition, there is growing demand for solutions that can improve individual nutritional choices,"" said UBS analyst Charles Eden in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""Personalised nutrition ... represents a potential such solution."" Personalization is a theme that has swept many industries in recent years. An increasing number of businesses are sending out questionnaires to customers to create profiles for their likes, dislikes and needs. Customized weight loss programs, clothing and shopping companies, makeup brands, vitamin providers, are just a few to have delved into an industry with massive growth potential, said Eden. UBS's theory is that food, medical diagnosis, technology and food delivery companies can all benefit from this industry. From services as simple as questionnaires, blood samples and genetic profiling, companies can capitalize on society's shift in support to improved nutritional habits. UBS said it sees four major industries capitalizing on this opportunity: Medical diagnosis firms to extract and interpret test results; Technology companies to develop wearable tech and integrated platforms for users to receive ongoing interactive feedback; Food producers to meet nutritional demand; And, food delivery companies to meet consumers' increasing demand for convenience. Illumina, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Apple, FitBit, Nestle, 23andMe, Ancestry.com, Unilever, Amazon Fresh and Uber Eats are some of the companies UBS mentioned as being in the game. The personalized nutrition opportunity has not been lost on current food company incumbents. ""Nestlé, the world's largest food company, has identified personalised nutrition as a major growth opportunity and has made a number of investments in the space,"" said Eden. Nestle puts money into research from brain health, pediatrics, chronic medical conditions, obesity, malnutrition, and gastro-intestinal health. Companies like Apple have bet big on personalized health, which could make the Tim Cook-led tech giant a potential pioneer in the personalized nutrition industry. Apple has identified the health care industry as an area of innovation, with its popular Apple Watch providing real-time personal health data to its wearers. ""The Apple Watch is already being used to study heart rates, perform ECGs, study eating disorders, track fitness and many other health metrics. Health data in Apple Watch could be combined with genetic information to offer personalized nutrition,"" said Eden. Even Amazon Fresh, the e-commerce giant's grocery delivery service, and Uber Eats are well-positioned to win in this budding industry, said UBS. ""Delivery will allow for increased convenience and time savings in food preparation (e.g. partnering with Delivery Hero or Uber Eats to deliver the exact meal which has been freshly prepared to meet the needs of that individual consumer),"" said Eden. Eden said affordability is the most obvious constraint on the personalized nutrition scenario in the near term. Healthier foods can be more expensive than mass produced box items, and the personalization will also come with a cost. Scientific evidence on the merits of personalizaiton are also lacking, UBS said. Data privacy is a hurdle as well if consumers don't want their medical, biological or genetic information shared with other parties. — with reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/19/personalized-nutrition-could-be-the-next-plant-based-meat-worth-64-billion-by-2040-says-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="

Analysts polled by the bank had expected a net profit of $973 million for the quarter. The Swiss lender had reported a net profit attributable to shareholders of $1.6 billion for the previous quarter, as financial market volatility enabled the operating profits of the Swiss investment bank to surge. However, it had warned of an uncertain future in the coming quarters as the pandemic began to spread throughout the world, eventually bringing the global economy to a standstill. Higher trading activity continued to bolster the bank's earnings in the period, but was unable to offset the pandemic-induced downturn in its retail and corporate banking units. Here are the highlights from the second-quarter earnings report: The results included credit loss expenses of $272 million, of which $110 million came in personal and corporate banking and $78 million in the investment bank. In its outlook, the bank warned that continued group credit losses could be expected in the second half of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but said these would be below those seen in the first half. UBS also said it was reviewing the mix between cash dividends and share buybacks in light of the elevated uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. ""While it is premature to provide guidance for 2020, going forward the intention is to continue to pay out excess capital and maintain the overall capital returns to shareholders consistent with previous levels,"" the bank said in its earnings report, adding that share repurchases may continue in the fourth quarter depending on business development and the second-half outlook. In a statement Tuesday, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti said: ""As we continue to face a challenging environment, we are adapting and accelerating the pace of change, supporting our clients, employees, and the economies in which we operate, while remaining focused on our strategic priorities."" Ermotti will be replaced at the helm by ING CEO Ralph Hamers on November 1 this year. Ermotti told CNBC on Tuesday morning that the scale and frequency of potential geopolitical, political and economic events in the second half of the year means more clients will be looking to alter their asset allocation before year-end. He pointed to a UBS client survey which revealed that 61% of clients are considering rebalancing their portfolios after the U.S. election on November 3, regardless of the outcome. ""If I put everything together, I do expect the second half of the year maybe not to be as benign as the first half, but still quite robust,"" Ermotti told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" He also suggested that there is a degree of either ""complacency"" or ""over-optimism"" in financial markets, with most asset classes now at or around their pre-Covid levels despite a multitude of possible tail risks. ""Credit is still not there but has been coming in a lot, and therefore there is not a lot of room for disappointment in the financial markets,"" Ermotti said. ""In that sense, should the situation deteriorate, I do expect some movements in the market to reflect the new economic data that we will see coming out after the summer.""",2020-07-21,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/ubs-earnings-q2-2020.html?&qsearchterm="

""We are looking for a strong earnings recovery across all major regions of the world,"" said Tan Min Lan, Asia Pacific head of chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""In Asia itself, earnings actually were remarkably resilient in 2020, actually it fell by 1% versus the global earnings which declined between 25% to about 30% in some of the key regions."" ""In 2021, we think earnings in Asia will rise about 23%. There will be a broadening of recovery outside of north Asia,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday. Timothy Moe, chief Asia-Pacific regional equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, was also bullish on earnings growth in the region. ""We think we're … on the cusp of a very significant earnings recovery in Asia and so we're looking at about 24%, 25% earnings growth this year and then a further importantly 16% next year,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia."" Markets have ""obviously paid forward for that"" with their very strong performance last year, Moe added. ""But even with valuations at this extended level, as long as interest rates stay low, we think that markets can roughly hold on to their current valuation and ride the underlying earnings recovery up — which we think is going to result in some further attractive gains for markets this year, albeit … not quite as strong as we had last year,"" Moe said. The hunt for yield will continue amid a low interest rate environment, Tan from UBS said, adding that investors can look for investment returns in a couple of ways. They can take on more credit risk, for instance, by investing in emerging market bonds and sovereign U.S.-dollar Asian high-yield bonds, she said.  ""Secondly, is to look for dividend yielding stocks, because as the economy recovers, the ... economically sensitive stocks, I think their dividend payment capacity is going to be restored,"" she said. ""There are good quality companies in the financial space, in the energy space that still provide reasonable dividends.""  Tan also addressed the impact of U.S. regulatory actions on Chinese stocks. The New York Stock Exchange is set to delist three Chinese telecommunications giants after going back and forth on that decision.  The exchange first announced on Dec. 31 that U.S.-traded shares of China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom will be removed from the Big Board as soon as Jan. 7. It cited compliance to President Donald Trump's executive order banning investments in companies with alleged ties to China's military.  But on Tuesday, the stock exchange reversed its decision and halted the process, before making another U-turn overnight to delist the firms after all. However it plays out, Tan said that any impact on the Chinese stocks won't be too significant.

But also, [it's] a bit late, let's be honest.""","In this article UBS has beat expectations for the first quarter of 2022 and said it has further reduced its exposure to Russia. The Swiss bank on Tuesday reported net profit attributable to shareholders of $2.136 billion, above forecasts compiled by the bank of $1.79 billion. It marks a 17% rise from the $1.82 reported for the same period of 2021 and follows a drop in quarterly net profit to $1.35 billion at the end of the year. The bank has previously described its market risk exposure to Russia as ""limited"" and on Tuesday said it had reduced its exposure to $0.4 billion as of March 31, compared with $0.6 billion at the end of 2021. In addition, it said it had no material exposure to Ukraine or Belarus, and that it is not conducting any new business in Russia or with Russia-based clients. ""Macroeconomic, geopolitical and market factors created a high level of uncertainty in the first quarter, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, COVID-related restrictions and lockdowns, higher volatility, the lower economic growth outlook, and concerns about higher inflation and the monetary policy response,"" the bank said in a release Tuesday. Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Tuesday, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said: ""It is pretty unpredictable out there."" Here are some other key metrics for the quarter: The company's stock traded almost 2% higher shortly after markets opened in Europe. A key uncertainty on the horizon is how central banks will react to higher inflation — and this can have direct consequences on banks' performance. ""The ECB will closely look at what the [U.S. Federal Reserve] is doing and the Fed is ahead of the ECB. But also, [it's] a bit late, let's be honest. So the ECB is a little bit late as well, because they don't want to ... be faster than the Fed,"" Hamers told CNBC. The European Central Bank has said it will end its asset purchases program in June, but has not yet given a precise timeline for when it might increase interest rates. ""We do expect that there will be a first hike in rates towards the end of the year on the ECB side,"" Hamers said. Another issue facing the European economy is whether the war in Ukraine will drag it into recession. European leaders have imposed tough sanctions on Russia and are considering further measures to punish the Kremlin, including a possible ban on oil imports. When asked if oil and natural gas sanctions on Russia could pose a risk for Europe, Hamers said: ""Of Russian oil not so much, of Russian gas that's a different — a much bigger challenge and that is really because large part[s] of industries are dependent on gas as their base commodity to make their product ... so that's what could cause the second order effect specifically in the European economy.""",2022-04-26,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/ubs-earnings-q1-2022-.html?&qsearchterm="
"Super fast travel using outer space could be $20 billion market, disrupting airlines, UBS predicts","In a decade, high speed travel via outer space will represent an annual market of at least $20 billion and compete with long-distance airline flights, UBS says.UBS expects the broader space industry, which is worth about $400 billion today, will double to $805 billion by 2030.Long haul airplane flights that are more than 10 hours in duration would ""be cannibalized"" by point-to-point flights on rockets, UBS said.","UBS believes there will be very lucrative ramifications from the space flight efforts currently led by Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and Blue Origin. A lengthy UBS report published on Sunday found that, in a decade, high speed travel via outer space will represent an annual market of at least $20 billion and compete with long-distance airline flights. Space tourism will be a $3 billion market by 2030, UBS estimates. ""While space tourism is still at a nascent phase, we think that as technology becomes proven, and the cost falls due to technology and competition, space tourism will become more mainstream,"" UBS analysts Jarrod Castle and Myles Walton wrote in the note. ""Space tourism could be the stepping stone for the development of long-haul travel on earth serviced by space."" UBS expects the broader space industry, which is worth about $400 billion today, will double to $805 billion by 2030 when accounting for these innovations. While these sub-sectors would be a small part of that, Castle and Walton said ""the outlook for the space economy, space tourism and long-haul travel using space has become much more bullish."" Private space companies ""are investing aggressively across the space opportunity,"" UBS said, and the firm believes access to space ""is the enabler to broader opportunities for investment."" Long haul airplane flights that are more than 10 hours in duration would ""be cannibalized"" by point-to-point flights on rockets, UBS said. The firm pointed to SpaceX's plans to use the massive Starship rocket it is building to fly as many as 100 people around the world in minutes. SpaceX said that Starship would be able to fly from New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes, rather than the 15 hours it takes currently by airplane. UBS estimates that there are more than 150 million passengers a year that fly routes longer than 10 hours. Last year, those routes saw 527,000 routes on airplane that had an average of 309 seats, UBS said. ""If we assume that 5 percent of these flights in the future are serviced by space at $2,500 per trip, the revenue opportunity as of today would be more than $20 billion per year as of today,"" UBS said  ""Although some might view the potential to use space to service the long-haul travel market as science fiction, we think ... there is a large market,"" UBS said. UBS noted that ""it is unlikely that a rocket will carry over 300 people anytime soon,"" so the Starship's capacity of 100 will be the maximum for the foreseeable future. However, UBS believes there may be an ""increased frequency of space travel during the day to enable the same volume of passengers,"" the firm said. ""Given the length of long-haul commercial travel, and the rules around crewing and take-off and landing time slot restrictions at airports, we think a re-usable rocket (especially if not land-based) would have materially better utilisation rates than a commercial plane,"" UBS said. As a result, UBS believes the $20 billion estimate ""could prove conservative,"" the firm said. More than 10 percent of people in a recent UBS survey said they would choose a spacecraft over an aircraft for long distance travel. ""While the timing of such a long haul service is uncertain, we think our base-case assumptions are conservative,"" UBS said. The billions of dollars pouring into private space companies represents ""a high level"" of capital formation, UBS said. Even though space tourism ""is still nascent,"" UBS said they believe the sub-sector ""will become mainstream as the technology becomes proven and cost falls."" To date, space tourism has largely been limited to the few flights organized by U.S.-based Space Adventures. Over the past two decades, the company has flown seven tourists using Russian Soyuz rockets. At a reported cost of more than $20 million per person, the private clients typically spent over a week on board the International Space Station. But now ""there are a number of commercial space ventures to open up suborbital travel,"" UBS noted. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are leading those efforts, both getting steadily closer to launching paying tourists. ""This area seems to be the market that has the greatest potential to gain traction quickly,"" UBS said. Virgin Galactic is deep into the development program of its spacecraft. Last month, the space venture owned by Sir Richard Branson sent test passenger Beth Moses on Virgin Galactic's spaceflight – a first for a private U.S. company. Virgin Galactic's spacecraft holds up to six passengers along with the two pilots. As the company has more than 600 would-be astronauts signed on to launch, Moses' work is key to preparing Virgin Galactic for commercial operations. Tickets for Virgin Galactic's flights are priced at $250,000 each. UBS believes Virgin Galactic's business model, as both a tourism company and manufacturer of spaceships, mimics the growth of businesses in the early days of aviation. ""In this way history could repeat itself as United Airlines today can trace back its roots to the Boeing Aircraft & Transport Company,"" UBS said. Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is also nearing its first spaceflights with human passengers. Blue Origin is developing the New Shepard rocket system for the company's space tourism business. As both Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin utilize reusable spacecraft systems, UBS believes the companies will be able to make space tourism ""a more common occurrence"" as reliability increases and prices decline. ""We estimate space tourism will be a $3 [billion plus per year] opportunity growing at double digit-rates,"" UBS said. ""This would be similar to what happened in commercial aviation, especially after the rise of low-cost airlines."" SpaceX could also see significant cash flow from space tourism, UBS believes, through two different ventures. Elon Musk's company just completed a historic test flight of its Crew Dragon capsule, which will be able to send as many as four astronauts to the space station. UBS estimates that NASA will pay SpaceX about $58 million on average per astronaut, compared to the $81 million per astronaut for flights on Russian Soyuz rockets. The second SpaceX opportunity is for early flights of Starship to send tourists on missions beyond the Earth's immediate orbit. In September, Musk announced Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa signed with SpaceX to fly around the moon on Starship. Maezawa expects to fly in 2023, with six to eight guests joining him for the flight.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/18/ubs-space-travel-and-space-tourism-a-23-billion-business-in-a-decade.html?&qsearchterm="
"More people are going to the mall to eat at the food court, not shop, UBS says","UBS says apparel spending continues to move online, away from bricks-and-mortar stores, with about 25% of total apparel sales in the U.S. taking place on the internet.It expects that to grow to 31% by 2023.","More and more people are going to the mall to eat at the food court, not to buy clothes, according to a survey from UBS. The investment bank said apparel spending continues to move online, away from bricks-and-mortar stores, with about 25% of total apparel sales in the U.S. taking place on the internet today. It expects that to grow to 31% by 2023. ""Shoppers say they increasingly go to the mall to eat at the food court or just hangout instead of visiting a big box store,"" analyst Jay Sole said. ""Since the mall is no longer the place consumers discover fashion, it makes sense the reasons they visit the mall are changing. ... For the sixth straight year, U.S. consumers say the availability of online shopping is causing them to visit large regional and outlet malls less."" UBS expects the shift will hurt department store chains, such as Macy's and J.C. Penney, more than anything else. It said ""disruption"" in the apparel industry will go on for ""at least the next five years."" In its survey of more than 2,500 consumers, UBS said the percentage of people who go to the mall to shop at department stores fell to 20% this year, from 25% a year ago. It said the percentage who go to the mall to eat rose to 7% from 4%. Additionally, Sole explained younger shoppers are leading the changes. UBS said it found people between the ages of 18 and 34 buy more clothes online than older generations. It said apparel shoppers ages 18 to 24, for example, are spending 38% of their apparel budgets online this year, up from 32% in 2014. ""The internet has fundamentally challenged malls' value proposition,"" Sole went on. ""The mall, in the past, was a great aggregator. It was a one-stop-shop where consumers could see everything happening in the world of fashion. Today, the vast majority of fashion discovery happens online. ... Consumers don't need the mall to help them figure out what is cool."" Mall owners are starting to realize this, however. They're not ignorant to the shifting consumer preferences. Some of the biggest mall owners in the U.S., such as Simon Property Group, Taubman and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, are investing in new food hall concepts, as they increasingly devote space at their properties to entertainment uses and dining. The new American Dream mall in New Jersey, once it is complete, will be 45% retail shops and the rest of the square footage will be devoted to eateries, theme parks, a ski slope, miniature golf and an ice rink, among other things for visitors to do.

It plans to spend $2 million and is partnering with ME Engineering on the systems and architecture firm Populous. ""The long-term solution is going to be medicine, treatment, and vaccine,"" added Leiweke. ""But it's also going to be cleaner, smarter air. So, in an indoor space, what we're thinking is – how do we create cleaner, fresher air?""

""What we haven't figured out is: What does the beast cost, and how do you build it?"" Since the pandemic began, sports teams have researched virus-killing solutions, including air cleaners, as indoor-based leagues hope to attract spectators back for 2020-21 seasons.  The University of Houston created air filters to trap and kill viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The filter uses a unique heated nickel foam material, which helps destroy viruses. With demand growing due to the pandemic, the HVAC filters market is projected to become a $7.1 billion market by 2025, up from its current $5.5 billion value. The pandemic has delayed construction on the Elmont facility, pushing its scheduled debut in 2021 by two months.

"'Don't be under the illusion' that an economic recovery will come quickly with a vaccine, UBS' Weber says","The announcement earlier this week that an effective coronavirus vaccine has been developed was given a rapturous welcome by global markets.UBS Chairman Axel Weber cautioned that even with a vaccine, it will take time for the global economy to get back to pre-crisis levels.It could take a considerable amount of time to mass produce the vaccine and distribute it around the world.","The announcement earlier this week that an effective coronavirus vaccine has been developed was given a rapturous welcome by global markets, but UBS Chairman Axel Weber cautioned that even with a vaccine, it will take time for the global economy to get back to pre-crisis levels. ""Going forward, I'm not pessimistic. I mean, eventually we'll get through this. But we should not be under the illusion that it will happen fast, it will take some time,"" Weber told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche Tuesday. ""It would be at least a year to go back to pre-crisis levels of GDP (gross domestic product). It'll take another year or two to be anywhere near getting unemployment and pre-crisis growth back and so it would be quite a long recovery that we're facing,"" he said as UBS holds a virtual European conference this week. Hopes that life, and the economy, could get back to normal sooner rather than later got a huge boost on Monday when U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech announced that their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19. Pfizer's CEO and Chairman Dr. Albert Bourla hailed the development as ""a great day for science and humanity"" and stock markets around the world soared. The optimism around the announcement was tempered with a dose of reality given the likely difficult logistics of mass production and transportation of a vaccine, particularly when time is of the essence in terms of saving lives and livelihoods.    The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses per person and based on current projections, only 25 million people could be vaccinated by the end of the year; Pfizer and BioNTech said they expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  The world population is estimated to be around 7.5 billion and there could be wranglings over which countries receive the vaccine first, although governments in Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. have already bought millions of doses. Asked about his reaction to the vaccine, Weber said while ""it was definitely good news,"" it would take time to roll out vaccination programs at a domestic and global level. The expectation is that Covid-19 vaccines will be given to those in health and service occupations first, as well as the most vulnerable members of society, before it's rolled out to the rest of the population. ""We've been waiting for some good news for some time now ... And the latest news has been really taken well by the market. But you know, you have to take this with a grain of salt,"" Weber cautioned. ""The disappointing part of the news was that the much lower than expected number of vaccinations that can be produced in a year, and if you look at the rollout, that will happen, it's going to take some time, 'til we move to roll this out."" Asked what the vaccine means for the Swiss lender's forecast for 2021, Weber was cautiously optimistic. ""You know, if dispensing that way ... actually has an impact on economic activity, it will eliminate some tail risks, and some of the human suffering will be much improved as a result of it. But it's a long haul (before) we get anything that is close to what people call mass immunity,"" he said.",2020-11-11,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/coronavirus-vaccine-doesnt-mean-a-quick-economic-recovery-ubs-weber.html?&qsearchterm="

"Keep your money in stocks regardless of risk appetite, UBS says","UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, said investors should keep their money in the stock market this year regardless of their risk appetite.Investors would have missed out on a 10 percent rally if they had sold their holdings on Christmas Eve and re-entered the market this month, said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.A recession is not likely to happen this year, so corporate earnings can still grow, although slower than before, Haefele said.","UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, said investors should keep their money in the stock market this year regardless of their risk appetite. Markets have been volatile in recent months as investors re-position for slower global growth and heightened uncertainties. That's set to continue, leading some investors to consider whether it's time to get out of equities and hold cash before a recession hits — but UBS said there's still money to be made in the stock market. ""You have to stay invested, whatever your risk tolerance can bear,"" Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said on Monday. ""The period of 18 months to 6 months before a recession is often when you get most of your returns because that's when economies do strongly,"" he told clients at the UBS Wealth Insights forum in Singapore. He noted that investors would have missed out on a 10-percent rally if they had sold their holdings on Christmas Eve — when U.S. stocks experienced a massive sell-off — and re-entered the market this month. In addition, a recession is not likely to happen this year, so corporate earnings have room to grow, although at a slower pace than before, he said. Haefele said UBS is ""overweight"" on global equities, adding that investors should diversify their share holdings outside of their home market to avoid an over-exposure to particular risks. ""At this time, it's better to invest globally. People tend to concentrate on their own region and that gives them two kinds of over-exposure: One is you're overweight a certain region, and also some regions tend to be overweight certain sectors,"" he said. In Asia, UBS likes China, Singapore, South Korea and Indonesia, said Tan Min Lan, head of the Asia Pacific investment office at UBS Global Wealth management. The bank doesn't like markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines, she added. On specific stocks, Tan said UBS likes ""high-yielding Asian equities"" such as major Chinese banks, and real estate investment trusts in Singapore and Hong Kong with large market capitalization. ""If you take into account corporate fundamentals, still positive growth rates and China policy easing that is ongoing, we do think that this year, equity markets will probably return between 12 to 15 percent in total returns,"" Tan told CNBC's ""Capital Connection."" But trade tensions between China and the U.S. remain the elephant in the room, and that ""will define Asia's fortunes not just for 2019, but also in the years ahead,"" she noted. ""Our base case is that there will be sufficient progress in the trade negotiation to delay further tariffs escalation, but the substantive issues will still remain. So, the most likely scenario for U.S.-China is in the years ahead, there will still be many rounds of fights or talks over a broad range of issues,"" she said.",2019-01-14,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/14/ubs-wealth-insights-overweight-global-equities-likes-china-shares.html?&qsearchterm="
"Rate cuts won't boost the stock market, UBS says: 'The Fed put is dead'","""When it comes to U.S. stocks, the Fed put is dead,"" UBS equity strategist Francois Trahan says. ""In the past 20 years, the so-called 'Fed Put' has failed to revive equities the way rate cuts did in the 1990s.""When the Fed slashed rates in 2001 and 2008 to salvage the economy from recessions, U.S. equities did not rally following the rate reductions, UBS notes.Traders are now pricing in a 20% chance of a rate decrease on Wednesday and a nearly 90% of at least one cut in the July meeting.","Investors seem to think if there's a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, stocks will automatically rally. That may not be the case. That's the message from UBS ahead of the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday. Traders are betting that the central bank would deliver an easing of monetary policy soon to provide the economy with some insurance and hence boosting stocks, but UBS believes such a move would do little to lift the market. ""When it comes to U.S. stocks, the Fed put is dead,"" UBS equity strategist Francois Trahan said in a note Monday. ""In the past 20 years, the so-called 'Fed Put' has failed to revive equities the way rate cuts did in the 1990s. The two easing cycles of this millennium took place amidst severe declines in equities."" The correlation between the 's price-earnings ratio and the fed funds rate has broken due to the long period of low rates since the early 2000s, UBS noted. When the Fed slashed rates in 2001 and 2008 to salvage the economy from recessions, U.S. equities did not rally after the rate reductions. In fact, the S&P 500 fell as much as 16% in the 12-month period after the cuts, the bank pointed out.  The market has been increasingly betting on a rate cut ever since Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."" Traders are now pricing in a 20% chance of a rate decrease on Wednesday and a nearly 90% of at least one cut at the July meeting, while a September cut is almost a done deal, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, stocks have fully come back from the May turmoil with the S&P 500 up more than 16% so far this year and about 1% from its all-time high hit in late April. Unlike in the 1990s when the S&P 500 P/E ratios responded to the interest rate changes, now they are behaving ""very cyclical,"" meaning being driven by leading economic indicators, UBS said. ""This does not bode well for equities as it suggests that P/Es will likely continue to compress as long as leading indicators of the economy continue to slow. Fed rate cuts are unlikely to change any of this in the near term,"" Trahan said.

Improved deliveries in the second quarter could drive Telsa shares in the near term but second-quarter profits and deliveries in the second half of the year are keeping UBS cautious on Tesla's stock. UBS maintained its sell rating on the stock and lowered its 12-month price target to $160 from $200. Tesla's stock was slightly higher Friday  at $223.35. ""Deliveries may provide a pop, but earnings may cause a drop,"" UBS analyst Colin Langan said in a note to clients. ""We expect losses in the second half to increase as deliveries likely soften and the impact of pricing actions continues to weigh on margins."" Tesla's decline in deliveries in the first quarter worried investors and pressured shares. Shares of the automaker fell by more than 10% after the company said it delivered 63,000 vehicles in the first quarter, while analysts were expecting Tesla to deliver about 76,000 cars. UBS said if Tesla can show a strong recovery in deliveries in the second quarter, close to its 90,000 to 100,000 target, ""it would likely appease bulls,"" Langan said. However, UBS is expecting a larger earnings loss in the second half of 2019. Langan lowered Telsa's earnings per share estimates for the rest of 2019 until 2023. UBS cut Tesla's second-quarter earnings-per-share estimate to a loss of 78 cents from a loss of 49 cents. Langan said a key concern for margins is the $2,400 average estimated Autopilot price cut. There will be a profit decline per car and 70% of buyers chose the autopilot option, UBS estimates. ""As we expect margin headwinds & slowing deliveries, we remain bearish,"" said Langan.

Francois Trahan, head of U.S. equity strategy for UBS, raised his 2020 target on the S&P 500 to 3,250 from 3,000, seeing the market decline in the first half of the year amid an earnings slowdown and recover fully in the second half on economic optimism. The benchmark now trades at about 3,240. ""We expect a V-shaped year for the S&P 500,"" Tranhan said in a note on Tuesday. ""We see the Index struggling in H1'20, as forward earnings come under pressure, and rebounding vigorously in H2'20, as equities start to discount an upcoming recovery in the economy."" Tranhan's new target still puts him below top Wall Street strategists' average forecast of 3,330 for the S&P 500 in 2020, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey. The UBS analyst expects the benchmark to drop as much as 16% by May when leading economic indicators such as the ISM manufacturing data bottom, based on the market's historical performance. Also, a decline in earnings expectations will pose a big threat to the market in the near term, Tranhan said. ""Leading indicators of S&P 500 forward earnings argue that they will continue to slow for several more quarters. This is the biggest risk the S&P 500 faces in the near term,"" Tranhan said. The market will stage a big comeback in the second half of the year as the benefit of lower interest rates filters through the economy, Tranhan predicted. ""It is not a secret that lower rates start the clock ticking to an eventual recovery in the economy. What is sometimes a surprise, however, is the 24-month lead time between a change in rates and its eventual impact on U.S. GDP,"" he said. The Federal Reserve cut rates three straight times in 2019 beginning in July from a peak in rates in December 2018, so the market's rebound could begin in the fourth quarter this year after a big sell-off, according to Tranhan. The analyst didn't mention the presidential election in November 2020 in his prediction. Many strategists listed the event as a major risk to the market. Investors will experience increased volatility in 2020 as the economy goes through transition periods, and it's a good time to focus on stocks uncorrelated to the business cycle, Tranhan said. UBS screened stocks with three market-neutral factors — high buyback yield, high long-term growth and high asset turnover. The stocks most attractive to UBS include Kohl's, Morgan Stanley, Delta Air Lines, Qorvo and HP. ""Like all quantitative screens, it is meant to be used in conjunction with fundamental research,"" Tranhan said.

""It's an economy that we think has huge potential,"" Tay said, adding that growth in the country is ""outstripping"" its frontier market peers. Vietnam was one of Asia's top-performing economies in 2020 and among the few countries that managed to record growth last year as authorities globally scrambled in their battle against the coronavirus pandemic. It saw 2.9% growth in 2020, narrowly edged out by the Taiwanese economy's 2.98% growth. In recent years, the nation has been viewed as an alternative manufacturing hub for companies looking to move production out of China to avoid being caught in the crossfire of tensions between Beijing and Washington. The Vietnamese stock market is also seeing strong growth and is on track to become bigger than the Philippines in terms of market capitalization ""sometime the middle of this year,"" according to Tay. The VN-Index in Vietnam initially saw a strong start to 2021 but later fell sharply as fears of a coronavirus resurgence weighed on investor sentiment. So far in 2021, the index has risen about 1%, as of its Tuesday close. Still, Tay acknowledged that risks remain for those looking to invest in Vietnam. Firstly, liquidity remains a challenge, the chief investment officer said. Furthermore, he cautioned that Vietnamese authorities have been known to use currency controls as a monetary policy choice.

"UBS Group CEO on Puerto Rico: 'We could have done things better'","At its peak, UBS had the largest wealth management business in Puerto Rico, representing an estimated 20,000 households. By 2012, island investors had about $10 billion invested in UBS bond funds.The bond funds were highly leveraged and concentrated in securities issued by two Puerto Rico government entities.In 2013, the funds lost $3 billion in value, or nearly 70 percent. CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC there were not obvious warning signs in the years prior to that.","UBS could have done things differently in Puerto Rico, where thousands of the island's residents blame the Swiss financial services giant for the depletion of their life savings, the bank's CEO said in an interview. ""When you go back and you look at the situation, you could always argue that we could have done things better, or some people could have behaved better,"" Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in an exclusive interview on Monday. ""When there is scope for admitting something went wrong, we do that,"" Ermotti said. However, if ""we believe that there are situations where people are just trying to take advantage of something, then we will fight and we will just try to present facts."" He was referring to the tsunami of arbitration claims that have been filed against UBS by Puerto Rico-based investors for — among other counts — breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and fraud. The claims came after 2013, when 23 closed-end bonds funds managed or co-managed by UBS Puerto Rico and sold to island residents lost $3 billion in value, or nearly 70 percent, according to data from Securities Litigation and Consulting Group.  Ermotti said there were not obvious warning signs in the years prior to the UBS Puerto Rico bond funds imploding. ""Until 2013, it was very difficult to predict that things could…evolve in such a way,"" Ermotti said. No ratings agencies, ""nobody was waving their flag about the danger of Puerto Rico."" However, a CNBC investigation in December showed that a mere few months after Ermotti took over as CEO in November 2011, it was clear not only to the ratings agencies, but also to UBS, that Puerto Rico's credit was deteriorating. In a research report that UBS issued in January 2012, the firm identified major risks for investors holding the Commonwealth's debt, including the ""slower than anticipated recovery"" and ""rising debt burden."" The 45-page report recommended: ""Conservative investors with concentrated exposure to any single borrower in the municipal market should pursue portfolio diversification."" Ermotti says that despite the extremely tumultuous past few years, the financial firm has stayed on the island and is working together with regulators and through arbitration to try and find the best solutions for their clients. ""We are trying to clearly [and] constructively find resolutions,"" Ermotti said. ""The truth of the matter is we are very committed to Puerto Rico."" UBS Puerto Rico is a subsidiary of UBS Americas Financial Services headquartered in Weehawken, New Jersey. At its peak, UBS had the largest wealth management business in Puerto Rico, representing an estimated 20,000 households. By 2012, UBS investors on the island had about $10 billion invested in the bond funds, or roughly 10 percent of the island's gross domestic product.  UBS Puerto Rico has been the primary underwriter of a series of closed-end funds since the mid-1990s. And it managed or co-managed the 23 proprietary closed-end funds that could only be sold to Puerto Rico residents and corporations whose primary place of business is on the island. Through the years 2004 to 2008, the direct and indirect revenue generated by the bond funds accounted for 42 percent to 53 percent of UBS Puerto Rico's total revenue. Those profits flowed up the chain to the parent company, UBS AG. The funds had many unique qualities since they were offered in a U.S. territory, rather than a U.S. state. In particular, the bond funds weren't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or listed on a U.S. exchange like a typical mainland closed-end fund. This was because of a recently closed legal loophole that previously exempted U.S. territories from the Investment Company Act of 1940. That legislation, among other things, limited the use of leverage and barred certain types of transactions. The exemption allowed the UBS funds in Puerto Rico to be levered in many instances 2 to 1, which was the maximum amount legally allowed by Puerto Rico's securities regulations. The funds also had an immense overconcentration of Puerto Rico-issued securities. Two particular securities, bonds issued by the island's government development bank and bonds issued by a government-run corporation, accounted for more than 90 percent of the net assets in 10 of the UBS funds by the end of June 2013. The heavy concentration and high leverage of the funds ultimately led to  staggering losses for investors in 2013, after Puerto Rican bonds suffered a massive sell-off. Ermotti pointed out in Monday's interview that prior to their implosion, the closed-end funds were highly profitable for investors. ""The only thing we know, which is not an excuse but is an explanation, is that in the previous 20 years or so, clients and investors made $3 billion of profits [from the funds],"" Ermotti said. The massive decline in value of the funds ""led to multiple regulatory inquiries, as well as customer complaints and arbitrations with aggregate claimed damages of USD 2.5 billion, of which claims with aggregate claimed damages of USD 1.5 billion have been resolved through settlements, arbitration or withdrawal of the claim,"" according to UBS's first quarter 2018 report. The firm settled with the SEC in 2012 for $26.6 million and in 2015 for $15 million. Also in 2015, UBS settled with Finra, Wall Street's self-policing regulatory agency, for $18.5 million. A year earlier, in 2014, UBS settled with Puerto Rico's local regulator, the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, for $5.2 million. The regulators' charges included that the firm misrepresented and omitted material facts about the closed-end bond funds to investors and failed to monitor the combination of leverage and concentration levels in customer accounts, according to the settlement documents. UBS Puerto Rico did not admit or deny wrongdoing in any of the settlements. UBS has disclosed in regulatory filings that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal inquiry into the impermissible reinvestment of the non-purpose loan proceeds, in regard to the Puerto Rico funds.

"Ex-UBS broker sentenced in fraudulent Puerto Rico bond sales scheme","Jose Ramirez will be the first person to serve jail time for their role in the scheme, which centered on sales of UBS proprietary closed-end bond funds.From January 2011 through September 2013, Ramirez advised his clients to improperly borrow money in order to invest in UBS Puerto Rico bond funds. The sales generated approximately $1.2 million in commissions.A CNBC investigation in December 2017 found that UBS was not forthcoming with its clients and brokers about the extent of the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds.","WASHINGTON — A former top broker in Puerto Rico for the Swiss banking giant UBS was sentenced to a year and a day in prison Tuesday, months after he pleaded guilty to criminal bank fraud for pocketing $1 million in commissions in a scheme that saw many investors lose their life savings. Jose Ramirez will be the first person to serve jail time for a role in the scheme, which centered on sales of UBS proprietary closed-end bond funds. In a near-empty courtroom in DC federal court, Ramirez asked Judge Thomas F. Hogan for leniency. ""I'm not here to blame anyone else,"" Ramirez, a 60-year-old father of three, told the judge. ""I ruined my record, my life and the lives of those who looked up to me."" The sentence was shorter than the 33-month maximum recommended by the government. Judge Hogan also ordered two years of supervised release, a $500 fine and granted Ramirez's request to voluntarily report to prison. ""I'm faced with a human being who has admitted his wrongdoings, and I think is remorseful for his actions,"" Judge Hogan said. Ramirez, who is known to many in Puerto Rico as ""The Whopper"" pleaded guilty in November 2018 for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain and misuse credit lines to purchase securities. ""UBS terminated the employment of Mr. Ramirez in January 2014, following an internal investigation that determined (1) he had permitted or encouraged clients to engage in improper conduct, and (2) had provided misleading responses to firm management when questioned about it,"" Peter Stack, a spokesman for UBS, said in an emailed statement According to the government, from January 2011 through September 2013, Ramirez advised his clients to improperly borrow money in order to invest in UBS Puerto Rico bond funds. The sales generated approximately $1.2 million in commissions. The use of the credit lines to purchase securities was not allowed by UBS Puerto Rico. However, Ramirez contends that he was not the only broker whose clients used the loans to purchase securities. He alleges in his sentencing memorandum that UBS ""was fully aware of the transactions"" and ""issued letters to at least seven financial advisors for knowing, allowing, or encouraging"" the scheme. Ramirez has been the only person prosecuted for the involvement in the scheme to date. The sales generated commissions when the credit lines were drawn down at UBS's Utah subsidiary and then again when the clients used the money to invest in the closed end funds managed by Ramirez. These highly levered funds were chock full of Puerto Rico bonds. By the end of June 2013, two separate bonds accounted for more than 90 percent of the net assets in 10 of UBS funds. At its peak, UBS had the largest wealth management business in Puerto Rico, representing an estimated 20,000 households. A CNBC investigation in December 2017 found that UBS was not forthcoming with its clients and brokers about the extent of the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds sold to residents on the island, even as the values of the funds plummeted. By 2012, UBS investors on the island had about $10 billion invested in the funds, or roughly 10 percent of the island's gross domestic product. In 2013, the bottom fell out of the Puerto Rico bond market, which caused a steep drop in the value of the bond funds. Many customers were forced to sell their bonds funds because they had no other available assets to meet account maintenance calls. That created significant losses. According to the government, the market collapse ultimately exposed Ramirez's scheme. Later that year, in August, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority permanently barred him from acting as a broker or associating with a broker-dealer firm after he failed to cooperate with regulators during his on-the-record testimony. According to court documents, Ramirez didn't answer the regulator's questions because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution. He also asserted his constitutional right to remain silent in the legal proceedings for the SEC's civil case. Ramirez finally broke his silence this past Saturday when he named seven individuals, he alleges were either involved in, had knowledge of, or encouraged the transactions of the scheme. In his sentencing memorandum, Ramirez singled-out: Doel Garcia, a UBS executive, Ramiro Colon, a UBS Puerto Rico branch manager and his former supervisor, Carlos Ubinas, the chairman and president of UBS Puerto Rico, as well as four current or former UBS Puerto Rico brokers: David Lugo, Fernando Castillo, Leslie Highley and Luis Sanchez. In response to these allegations, a spokesman from UBS said: ""In its sentencing papers, the DOJ described Mr. Ramirez's offense as 'brazen', found that he took various steps to 'circumvent' UBS controls and to 'obscure' from UBS what he was doing, and found that Mr. Ramirez 'took advantage of all parties involved.' In light of these findings, Mr. Ramirez's last-ditch efforts to blame his victims for his own criminal conduct should be seen for what it is: an attempt to escape responsibility for his own wrongdoing."" CNBC reached out to lawyers or representatives of these individuals. Cory Jacobs, the trial attorney for the U.S. government, ""flatly objected"" to the assertion that Ramirez was made a ""scapegoat"" for the scheme. ""UBS did an internal investigation that identified the defendant as the hub of the fraud,"" Jacobs told Judge Hogan. He also said that people would go into UBS and ask for ""the whopper special."" Jacobs told the Judge that Ramirez had cooperated with the government during its investigation, but that the evidence and information he provided wasn't enough for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that other bankers were knowingly engaged in the fraudulent conduct. UBS added in its statement to CNBC, ""UBS refutes any insinuation of wrongdoing by any of the people he has tried to implicate."" A lawyer for Lugo said, ""Mr Lugo did not engage in the activities for which Mr. Ramirez was charged, and to which Mr. Ramirez pled guilty. Nor was Mr. Lugo ever even charged with conducting such activity. Mr. Lugo's employment arbitration against UBS-PR was settled to the satisfaction of both UBS-PR and Mr. Lugo."" UBS has previously settled with FINRA and the SEC for roughly $34 million for charges involving the sales practices of the bond funds and failure to supervise. UBS has also paid out nearly $480 million to clients in FINRA settlements and awards as of January, with over 800 cases against UBS Puerto Rico still pending, according to data compiled by SLCG. In addition, the Swiss bank has disclosed in regulatory filings an ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice into the impermissible reinvestment of loan proceeds, in regard to the Puerto Rico funds.

Net income for the first quarter came in at $1.1 billion, versus $848 million expected in a Reuters poll of analysts. However, this was lower than the $1.57 billion reported this time last year in what was a strong quarter for the bank. Here are the other key highlights of the first quarter of 2019: Sergio Ermotti, the group's chief executive officer, told CNBC Thursday that it was a ""very challenging quarter"" but he was ""pleased"" with the resilience of the results, nonetheless. The bank's wealth management division and its investment banking unit saw much lower operating profits than in the first quarter of 2018. The former registered an operating profit of $873 million, versus $1.1 billion a year ago. In investment banking, operating income fell to $221 million from $619 million a year ago. UBS said this was caused by the challenging trading environment, mainly in Europe and Asia. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, Ermotti also said the bank outperformed in 2018 and this would have accentuated the 64% drop in profits at the investment banking unit. ""Last year, we outperformed all our peers across the board, and therefore the year-on-year comparison is quite challenging to us,"" he said. Despite a tough start in 2019, UBS expects economic growth and market performance to recover and stabilize in the coming months. ""We are likely to benefit from this environment ... Higher invested assets are expected to lead to an increase in recurring revenues in Global Wealth Management and Asset Management, compared with the first quarter of 2019,"" the bank said in a statement. Ermotti confirmed to CNBC Thursday that the Swiss bank aims to repurchase up to $1 billion in shares this year, as announced at the end of 2018.

"Barclays analysts call for UBS strategy overhaul, suggest break up of Swiss bank","Barclays analysts cut the price target for UBS by 6%, questioning its ability to generate satisfactory returns.A note published Monday suggested a possible break up of the Swiss bank.","Barclays analysts have questioned the ability of UBS to achieve satisfactory returns, suggesting market expectations of the Swiss investment bank are too high. In a note published Monday, Barclays European banks analysts Amit Goel, Jun Yang and Krishnendra Dubey cut their price target for UBS by 6%, and suggested the bank may need a strategy overhaul to avoid weak profitability. However, they also noted that no imminent changes were expected. Justifying their ""underweight"" position on UBS compared to the neutral industry view, the analysts said that while the market environment may be challenging, competitors focusing on niche products were ""generating much higher RoEs (return on equity)."" ""Many investors we speak to believe that UBS should also be able to achieve higher returns, and have been frustrated for some time in this regard."" The note specifically referenced Swiss private bank Julius Baer, which most recently reported underlying pre-tax return on tangible investment (RoTE) of 33% for 2018. UBS is currently targeting RoTE of 12.5% in 2019, although sell-side analysts do not currently expect the group to achieve this. Along with questions of organization, the note also questions whether more broadly, it would make sense to ""break up"" the UBS group, and whether the ""costs of size are more than outweighing the benefits?"" The analysts acknowledged the common justifications offered for weak profitability, including the global nature of the business and structural costs of spanning different jurisdictions. The fact that the group's U.S. business has a structurally low operating margin, but is ""tax efficient,"" was also cited along with the significant amount of capital tied up in the investment bank. However, the note called into question whether the current business model could optimize returns, and whether the profitability potential of the group could in fact decline further from here. The note suggested the profitability of UBS' wealth business is being ""diluted away"" and called into question the bank's heavy focus on its investment bank, along with its emphasis on ultra-high net worth (UHNW) clients. ""The vast majority of the Investment Banking (IB) operations are unnecessary for the UHNW client base, or UHNW clients are lower profitability than HNW clients,"" the note stated. UBS management reaffirmed its current strategy at the investor update in October 2018 and the note said that since that date, expectations for the bank had been ""downgraded materially.""

In a note published Monday, strategists at the Swiss investment bank said that while investors should protect against any downside, it makes sense to stay invested in the S&P 500 on account of resilient earnings growth, low recession risk and cheap stock opportunities. The  fell 0.6% Friday, following a 2.5% decline in China's CSI 300 index, accompanied by reports that trade negotiations had stalled. The benchmark is down nearly 3% this month with some hefty bouts of selling after negative newsflow from the trade talks. However, UBS predicts more gains on top of the 14% it's already risen this year. The analysts set a six-month target for the S&P of 2,950 points, around 3.2% higher than the current level. ""Despite the imposition of tariffs and difficult year-over-year comparisons, the first-quarter U.S. earnings season illustrated the health of the corporate profit cycle,"" the note from the investment research team stated. UBS analysts expect a trade deal between the U.S. and China will be reached based on the prevalence of ""economic self-interest,"" and therefore maintain a forecast for S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) to rise 3% year-on-year in 2019, adding a further 7% in 2020. U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) confounded expectations in the first quarter to rise 3.2% on an annualized quarter-over-quarter basis, while unemployment recently dropped to 3.6%, its lowest reading in 50 years. ""The $20 trillion U.S. economy is large enough to absorb the threatened direct effects of tariffs without risking a recession,"" the analysts said. ""That said, a lasting and escalating trade dispute would have a chilling effect on investment spending that could represent a 0.75–1% hit to GDP."" Heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing do have the potential to undermine the U.S. economy and markets, and the UBS analysts would have expected a further 4.5% drag on earnings had the President Donald Trump administration followed through with all of its threatened tariffs last week. The U.S. on Friday delayed tariffs on cars and auto part imports for up to six months. The U.S. president has also threatened to put 25% tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese goods that remain untaxed.

Investors have been following developments around the trade negotiations for signs on where the tariff conflict is headed. On Friday, Chinese representatives, who were in Washington to discuss trade ahead of next month's high-level talks, unexpectedly cancelled a planned trip to meet with U.S. farmers. It was a development that sent the S&P 500 down slightly. ""You have to look through these because there've been ups and downs in these negotiations, there's been a lot of volatility on both sides about these negotiations,"" Axel Weber, chairman of the Swiss wealth management giant, told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford at the Singapore Summit. ""What we're interested in is the long term developments and whilst there is a big dispute at the moment, I think there's also potential for resolution. And the potential for resolution lies in the very fact that trade is really beneficial to both sides,"" he said. The U.S.-China trade war, which started more than a year ago, has hurt business confidence and is often cited as one of the bigger risks to the global economy. The International Monetary Fund, for one, warned that elevated tariffs as a result of the U.S.-China dispute could shave 0.8% off global economic output in 2020 — and potentially result in further losses in the following years. Both the U.S. and China would not be spared from such adverse economic impact — that's one of the factors that would continue to prod both parties to return to the negotiating table, predicted Weber. Like Blackstone Executive Vice Chairman Tony James, the UBS chairman said the two countries could reach ""an agreement that will sort out certain developments"" and leave other sticking points for further negotiations. In addition to the impact on economic growth, some experts have warned the U.S.-China bilateral fight could split the technology world in two. But Weber said that divide has existed from the very beginning, with China having developed technology platforms such as those by Chinese social media platform, WeChat, and e-commerce giant Alibaba, which are similar to Facebook and Amazon in the U.S. The trade war looks likely to reinforce those divisions — which is also bad news for the global business community, he added. ""There's very little expectation ... that Chinese consumers are going to move away from those to equivalent platforms to U.S.-like platforms,"" he said. ""So, we're not facing a new reality.

"Boeing and Airbus to see reduced jet demand as climate awareness grows, UBS says","Consumers are increasingly factoring in climate concerns when considering taking a flight says UBS.Jet demand could reduce as airlines witness fewer ticket sales.UBS sees biofuels as a main strategy for long-haul travel.","Rising concern about commercial flying's impact on the environment will act as a brake on passenger growth and reduce jet sales from the likes of Boeing and Airbus, according to a new report from UBS. A survey of more than 6,000 people has revealed that a growing number of travelers in Europe and America have already reduced the number of flights they took over the last 12 months because of heightened environmental awareness. Around one in four flyers in France, Germany and the U.S revealed to UBS that they had reduced flights. A smaller number of Brits (16%) admitted that climate change had forced them to forego at least one trip. Chief author of the report's findings and UBS's Head of European Industrials Equity Research, Celine Fornaro, added in the note Monday that around 27% of respondents were now ""thinking about it,"" when asked if climate worries could affect travel plans. That figure marked a rise from a similar survey taken by UBS in May which came out at 20%. Moves are afoot from European governments to discourage flying. France is to soon introduce a 1.50 euro levy on domestic tickets, rising to 18 euros ($20) on long haul travel. Germany is to double its taxes for flights originating from Germany from January next year and Switzerland is another country proposing a flight tax. UBS's model predicts that the upshot of personal concern allied to increased cost will reduce intra-European traffic growth over the next 20 years to 1.5% per year versus the 3% per year currently estimated by Airbus. Airbus also predicts air traffic within the U.S. will grow 2.1 percent each year through to 2038 but UBS trims that to 1.3% as people look for alternatives to taking a plane. China is tipped to soon be the world's largest aviation market but while Chinese respondents were not asked, the Swiss bank's researchers put forward the possibility that huge investment in train travel across China will slow the expected boom in flights. Airbus's most recent forecast says almost 11,000 new small jets will be needed to serve European and U.S. demand over the next two decades, but UBS believes that number should shrink by 7%. The bank says that in Airbus' case that could mean a reduction in revenue of almost 3 billion euros each year. Around three-quarters of respondents said they would be happy to fly in an electric or hybrid plane but only one in four said they would feel comfortable in a smaller self-piloted aircraft as a means of travel. A partially-electric regional plane is predicted by some in the industry to be around ten years away, but UBS believe battery technology may not develop to the point that can power larger craft. The researchers consider alternative biofuels as the most realistic option for long haul flights and noted efforts by California and Oregon to set new rules on carbon fuel standards for the transport sector. UBS noted however that while ""alternative fuels"" generate fewer emissions while being produced, once in the sky they emit similar levels of CO2 to traditional jet fuel.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/boeing-and-airbus-to-see-reduced-plane-demand-as-climate-awareness-grows.html?&qsearchterm="

This is lower than the $1.253 billion figure reported in the same quarter in 2018.The lender continues to face headwinds in its investment banking and global wealth management business.","Swiss lender UBS saw a 16% drop in its third-quarter net profit, compared to the same period last year, and a 59% slump at its investment banking unit amid a ""challenging environment."" The bank's net profit attributable to shareholders for the third quarter came in at $1.049 billion. This is lower than the $1.253 billion figure reported in the same quarter in 2018. Here are some key highlights for the quarter: UBS also said it expects to take restructuring expenses of $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. UBS, like its peers, is looking at ways to restructure as banks continue to face headwinds from low and negative interest rates. ""Low and persistent negative interest rates and expectations of further monetary easing will adversely affect net interest income compared with last year,"" UBS said in a statement Tuesday. ""As we execute on our strategy, we are balancing investments for growth while managing for efficiency,"" it added. Rising rates are good for banks since they are able to lend out money to investors at a profitable rate of interest. Lower interest rates restrict a bank's ability to make profits thus adding pressure on margins. UBS announced in August that it would introduce a 0.6% annual charge on cash savings of over 500,000 euros ($557,642) and 0.75% on savings of over 2 million Swiss francs ($2.03 million) in order to pass on the cost of negative rates. Speaking to CNBC Tuesday, CEO Sergio Ermotti said: ""The entire industry is faced with the same challenge on negative rates, so we are unfortunately forced to pass some of this pain, so we are not really passing all the pain of negative rates but I think it is inevitable that we will see, probably, the rest of the industry following on that."" UBS continues to face headwinds in its investment banking and global wealth management business. The lender's investment banking unit saw a 59% decline in the third quarter of 2019 in terms of adjusted operating profit before tax. Investment banking is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities. Meanwhile, the bank's global wealth management business saw an 2% decline in adjusted operating profit when compared to the same quarter last year. Addressing the bank's struggles with net interest and recurring fee income, Ermotti said the lender had been able to mitigate lower rates with higher transaction volumes, and was seeking to protect that dynamic. ""When I look at recurring fees, of course there you can see our clients' risk appetite is impacting recurring fees. We see them still buying into mandates but with lower risk profile, therefore with lower margins and in that sense, it was helpful in the third quarter to see the transaction line offsetting some of this,"" he told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. —CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this report.

A spokesman for the trader, Scott Hapgood, said the 44-year-old Darien resident cannot ""return to Anguilla to clear his name"" because authorities there ""will not give him a fair trial or guarantee his safety."" ""He's not going back,"" the spokesman, Jamie Diaferia, told CNBC. Diaferia said that as Monday's hearing approached, Hapgood's legal team had worked to obtain a guarantee that he would be protected if he returned to Anguilla, and that he would be allowed to return to the United States on bail after the hearing ended. Diaferia said Anguillan authorities declined to give those guarantees and also declined Hapgood's offer to appear at the hearing via a video link with the Caribbean island. The case has sparked outrage on Anguilla, where Hapgood's release on bail was heavily criticized. ""We understand there will be people in Anguilla who say Scott is running from a trial. That is 100% false,"" said Juliya Arbisman, Hapgood's international lawyer. ""There is nothing Scott wants more than to clear his name and get his life back. But he cannot clear his name if he is dead, or if the legal process by which he is bound is fundamentally biased and unjust."" Hapgood, who is on leave from UBS, is charged with killing 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel on April 13 in the Malliouhana Hotel, while two of Hapgood's children were in the room. Hapgood claims that Mitchel, who reportedly was intoxicated by alcohol and cocaine, entered his family's hotel room under the false pretense of having been sent there to fix a broken sink. Mitchel then attacked Hapgood — who was a defensive end on Dartmouth College's football team — with a knife after demanding money, according to Hapgood's account. A struggle ensued, and Mitchel died shortly thereafter. The New York Times has reported that a coroner initially ruled that Mitchel died from asphyxiation. But the same coroner later revised that report after toxicology tests, which suggested that Mitchel ""had so much cocaine in his bloodstream that he was essentially a dying man when he entered Mr. Hapgood's suite that day,"" the Times reported. Hapgood, an account manager with UBS Global Management in New York, is free on a $74,000 bond. Trump first took note of Hapgood on Oct. 14 after the Fox News show ""Fox and Friends"" — a favorite of the president's — aired a segment about the criminal case. ""Will be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla,"" Trump wrote in a tweet. ""Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved."" Twitter The White House had no immediate comment when asked about Hapgood failing to show up for his mandated court appearance on Anguilla. Hapgood's spokesman Diaferia noted in a statement that, ""Despite the unfairness of the charge continuing, Scott has cooperated with the Anguillan legal process and has returned to the island three times for hearings in an effort to clear his name."" ""But it has become progressively apparent that Scott would not receive a fair trial in Anguilla,"" the statement said. ""During the process, a toxicology report was suppressed, witnesses altered their accounts and submitted new statements that were false, a revised cause of death was ignored, legal counsel was excluded from the hearing, and numerous other actions that suggested that politics are governing Scott's case rather than the law and the facts."" The statement said that if authorities revoked Hapgood's bail, ""There is a significant likelihood Scott's incarceration would be indefinite, as a trial may not happen for many years."" And ""there is near certainty the death threats he has received will come to fruition if he were to be held in an Anguillan prison for any length of time,"" the statement said. Hapgood's wife, Kallie Hapgood, told The New York Post last month that she had ""begged him from day one not to go back there"" to Anguilla. ""He knows he did nothing wrong. He's not responsible for Mitchel's death, but to me, I don't know if that is enough to keep him safe. If he were to be remanded to prison, I think it would be the equivalent of a death sentence,"" Kallie Hapgood told The Post.",2019-11-11,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/ubs-trader-scott-hapgood-skips-anguilla-hearing-after-trump-comment.html?&qsearchterm="

A spike in trading and investment banking revenues helped lenders around the world to report solid earnings in the third quarter of 2020, benefiting from increased trading volumes and market volatility since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Earnings this week from the Wall Street banks have indicated that the sector could be set for a strong season, with Morgan Stanley beating expectations on Wednesday with a 51% increase in net profit for the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan had already posted earnings beats on the back of robust trading and investment banking results. In a note Wednesday, Barclays European banking analysts said market focus in the upcoming reporting season would be on lenders' plans to mitigate the continued effects of the pandemic, including cost actions to offset revenue pressure, along with the resumption of capital distribution and asset quality risks. While many banks have avoided announcing full-year guidance due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, Barclays Co-Head of European Banks Equity Research Amit Goel expects full-year guidance for 2021 to be announced in this cycle. UBS will kickstart the earnings season for Europe's major lenders on Jan. 26, having posted a 99% rise in net profit in the third quarter of 2020. Barclays analysts updated its estimates last week and now expect profit-before-tax increases of around 2.5%, 6.4% and 13.9% in 2022 for Credit Suisse, UBS and Deutsche Bank, respectively. Fourth-quarter revenues are expected to remain relatively subdued, albeit varied in terms of geography based on the pace of economic recovery in the fourth quarter, while retaining the bright spots in trading and investment banking. ""While the low interest rate environment continues to pressure bank profitability, we see some bright spots, such as the buoyant post-lockdown U.K. mortgage market,"" Goel said. Barclays expects trading revenues to remain elevated with several banks already providing guidance for the fourth quarter, and forecasts revenues up 18% from the same period in 2019, in U.S. dollar terms. Total revenues for the first nine months of 2020 were down by around 5% on aggregate across a sample of banks analyzed by DBRS Morningstar, largely weighed down by lockdowns in the second quarter of 2020 along with lower net interest income and ""other income."" DBRS Morningstar expects GDP growth to be positive across Europe in 2021, but analysts suggested that the still difficult environment may lead banks to tighten lending criteria and therefore limit revenues. ""Growth in lending to corporates could continue to be supported by government financing schemes and guarantees in the short-term, partly offsetting the negative impact of lockdowns,"" they said in a recent note. ""However, amid ultra-low rates, potentially higher funding costs, and other income such as net fees and commissions being penalised by lockdowns, the pressure on revenues is likely to continue."" An improvement in consensus macroeconomic expectations in most geographies since the third quarter of 2020 is expected to provide a supportive backdrop for banks, according to Barclays analysts, particularly with regard to cash set aside for expected loan losses. ""Our analysis suggests that the improvement in macroeconomic assumptions could result in loan loss provision write-backs,"" Goel said in the note. ""However, we believe that management teams are likely to take a conservative approach at 4Q20 given ongoing risks associated with new lockdowns, and instead we expect most banks to top-up their loan loss provisions."" While state guarantees mitigated the expected increase in non-performing loans in 2020, the unwinding of these measures and renewed lockdowns in a number of economies mean non-payments and a deterioration of banks' asset quality are likely to rise in 2021, DBRS Morningstar anticipates. ""The impact of the pandemic on European banks' asset quality and cost of risk in 2021 will depend on the length of economic restrictions and overall economic impact as well as on any additional support measures to prevent a major deterioration in borrowers' payment capacity."" In December, the European Central Bank and the U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority, along with other regulators, lifted bans on banks paying dividends to shareholders or repurchasing their own shares, albeit with guardrails in place. Euro zone banks regulated by the ECB are under tighter restrictions than those in the U.K. and Sweden. The ECB requested European banks refrain from or limit dividends until Sept. 30, and capped dividends below 15% of cumulated 2019-2020 net earnings. As a result, Barclays forecast an average dividend yield of around 1.5% for lenders in the common currency bloc compared to around 5% in Sweden and 2% in the U.K. ""With the restart of dividends, we think there will be increasing focus on the potential for highly accretive share buybacks (though we think these are most likely from 2H21),"" Goel said. Companies may buy back their own shares from the market when they have cash at hand, which usually boosts their stock price. DBRS analysts expect banks to maintain solid capital cushions, but noted that while the ECB guidelines reflect generally high solvency positions for European banks, the differing measures taken by regulators outside the euro zone may pose a challenge. ""Some non-Eurozone banks will likely have flexibility to pay larger dividends. Bans on dividends were widely introduced by global regulators in 2020, but regulators in countries including the U.K., Sweden, Norway for instance have lifted their dividend bans and introduced a cap of 25% instead,"" they said.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/analysts-key-themes-as-european-bank-earnings-season-begins-with-ubs-.html?&qsearchterm="

He hasn't actually acknowledged that the Federal Reserve is actually behind the curve — but they certainly are,"" Tay told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday.  Tay noted U.S. stock markets are doing relatively well and corporate earnings in the second and third quarter of last year were also at ""multi-decade highs."" ""And at this point in time they are still printing. So you must be wondering why they are still printing at this level, right?,"" he said, adding key developments going forward will be how fast and how much the Fed shrinks its balance sheet. Investors are awaiting Wednesday's key inflation data to assess the economic picture and the Fed's next move. The U.S. central bank spooked investors last week after minutes of its December meeting signaled members were ready to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than previously expected. It indicated it may be ready to start raising interest rates, dial back on its bond-buying program, and engage in high-level discussions about reducing holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.

Here's HSBC forecast To get ahead of the curve, Tay said the Fed could start normalizing the balance sheet earlier than expected. ""There is a 75% chance that the Federal Reserve will hike in March when tapering ends. The debate now is whether it's two or three hikes where the market is concerned. It could be four hikes this year as well,"" he said. He added there could be complications, especially if supply chain pressures ease in the coming months as this could reduce inflation expectations going forward. ""That means the Federal Reserve may not have to start normalizing the balance sheet as early as we actually expect,"" Tay explained, adding the situation at this stage remains fluid. Tay also underlined the Fed's faster policy tightening cycle is likely to impact Asian countries, especially emerging markets in the region.  ""If your U.S. Treasury yields on a 10-year basis rise up to about 2% and 2.5%, then the yields on this part of the world where the government sovereigns are concerned will have to behave accordingly,"" he said. This will affect some of the economies in Asia given their higher debt levels, he added. In 2013, the Fed triggered a so-called taper tantrum when it began to wind down its asset purchase program. Investors panicked and it triggered a sell-off in bonds, causing Treasury yields to surge. As a result, emerging markets in Asia suffered sharp capital outflows and currency depreciation, forcing central banks in the region to hike interest rates to protect their capital accounts. Tay said aggressive Fed policy could potentially slow the economic recovery in Asia. ""That's not something that you want at this point in time. Because at this point in time, a lot of the economies here are still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he noted.",2022-01-12,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/ubs-says-the-fed-is-behind-the-curve-in-shrinking-the-balance-sheet.html?&qsearchterm="

That debt is ""far and away"" the most pressing concern for GE investors, said UBS analyst Steven Winoker in a note on Monday. That concern was abundantly clear in feedback from clients, he said. ""While GE has been under considerable pressure lately, we maintain our conviction that the stock presents a long-term capital appreciation opportunity,"" Winoker said. ""It won't be quick, and it is likely to be volatile, but we see a path to improvement for both leverage and valuation."" UBS laid out one of the paths new GE chairman and CEO Larry Culp could take. In this scenario, UBS said GE would get about $33 billion from announced and coming asset sales. Winoker's outlook has GE paying down $5.4 billion in debt and obligations and transferring about $21 billion in cash to heavily levered GE Capital. ""The net is a ~$43 billion improvement in the Industrial net debt position,"" Winoker said. But GE still has a number of risks to improving its leverage. ""Litigation and investigation settlements could also come in higher than we currently forecast,"" Winoker said. Both the SEC and DOJ expanded their investigations into GE's accounting practices after GE took a $22 billion charge in the third quarter related to acquisitions made in its power business. GE reserved $1.5 billion in April for a potential legal settlement of the DOJ investigation. GE Capital could also ""see a further deterioration"" in cash generation, Winoker said.

Intention in buying an iPhone ""was down across the board"" and most significantly in the U.S. and China, UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients late Wednesday, citing a survey. IPhone buying intent in the U.S. has been dialed back to a five-year low, same as iPhone 6S levels, and interest in China also hit a new low, the UBS survey showed. In the U.S., only 18 percent of the survey respondents said they planned to buy an iPhone in the next 12 months, down from 21 percent last year, and close to the 17 percent in October 2015 during the iPhone 6S cycle. The purchase intent is 23 percent in China, which is 6 percent lower than last year's figure. The UBS survey interviewed 6,900 consumers across five countries and it was conducted after the new iPhones Xs and Xs Max were launched. As a result, UBS slashed its price target for Apple shares to $210 from $225 but maintained its buy rating. ""Investor expectations for this iPhone cycle are muted.

"London stock exchange could halt trading of Swiss companies like UBS amid EU standoff","According to a notice released Tuesday night, the exchange could halt trading in as many as 254 equity securities issued by Swiss companies.Switzerland and the EU are embroiled in an ongoing dispute regarding long-standing financial, immigration and trade ties between the two, since Switzerland is not a member of the bloc. The stock market equivalence granted to Switzerland by the EU expires at the end of June.","The London stock exchange (LSE) has warned investors they could be forced to halt the trading of Swiss stocks from Monday due to a political standoff between Switzerland and the European Union (EU). According to a notice released Tuesday night, the exchange could halt trading in as many as 254 equity securities issued by Swiss companies.  All of the shares are currently traded on the London Stock Exchange's MTF XLOM, a multilateral trading facility. MTFs are part of the European Union regulatory framework and provide an alternative to traditional stock exchanges, so none of the companies are listed on the main London Stock Exchange. Similar warnings have also been issued by exchange operators Aquis Exchange, CBOE Global Markets and UBS. Switzerland and the EU are embroiled in an ongoing dispute regarding long-standing financial, immigration and trade ties between the two, since Switzerland is not a member of the bloc. The stock market equivalence granted to Switzerland by the EU expires at the end of June. If the deadline passes on Sunday without an agreement on the EU's new political demands, and the bloc decides not to extend, the LSE notice explained that ""it is likely the Swiss authorities will remove the recognition that allows EU trading venues to offer trading in the Swiss equity securities."" European venues would face restrictions to trading in Swiss companies, including blue chip giants such as Nestle, UBS and Novartis, on Monday if Switzerland is not granted equivalence by the start of trading. A Nestle spokesperson told CNBC that the company is ""observing the situation"" but does not anticipate a ""significant impact"" on its shares. The obligation has been applicable to foreign trading venues if they admit shares of Swiss registered companies since January 1, but the Swiss Federal Department of Finance issued a statement Monday indicating that it is prepared to withdraw the recognition of EU venues. ""Trading venues in the EU would thus be prohibited from offering or facilitating trading in certain shares of Swiss companies from that date,"" the statement said.. ""Activating the protective measure with regard to trading venues in the EU serves solely to protect the functioning of the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure."" If the two parties fail to agree new terms in the ensuing days, investors face the prospect of a major overhaul, since Swiss companies comprise around one fifth of the Stoxx 50 index by market capitalization. For several years, the EU has been trying to implement a new framework consolidating over a hundred bilateral treaties governing ties between Brussels and Bern into one accord, in order to ensure the Swiss cannot renege on obligations such as immigration without losing EU market access. The EU's bargaining chip was a change to the way it grants market access, or equivalence, allowing Swiss companies to be traded on European exchanges. Switzerland received a one-year extension to agree to Brussels' demands in late 2017, and a further six-month extension at the end of 2018, which expires on Sunday, June 30. Beat Wittmann, partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday that the Swiss had more to lose from a fraying of relations. ""Switzerland has the most complex bilateral arrangement which served both sides pretty well, and quite frankly the Swiss only got away with this because we are relevant economically, prudent financially and very export sensitive, but we are not a big power at the table,"" he said. Wittmann added that while the equivalence discussion is ""only a little part of the great picture,"" the issue was heating up ahead of Swiss elections this fall, with ""nationalist and populist forces"" keen to capitalize on anti-EU sentiment.

"Central banks' key policy goals are under threat from climate change, warns UBS","Although the study revealed that central banks are ""conscious of their fiduciary duty"" to the public, just 9% have taken specific measures related to climate risk which go beyond basic requirements within broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks required by most public institutions.A detailed report from UBS global sovereign market strategists Massimiliano Castelli and Philipp Salman suggested ""there is growing empirical evidence that climate risk affects the two policy goals pursued by the central banks.""","Central banks around the world must proactively fight climate change in their own investment portfolios in order to safeguard their key priorities, according to research. A survey of central banks, carried out by UBS Asset Management, revealed that 62% believed a fiduciary duty to the general public was a key motivation for working climate risk into the management of their own assets. However, while 56% said they had noticed increased interest from peers in environmental issues, only 6% indicated that they had experienced increased scrutiny from politicians or supervisory bodies regarding the inclusion of climate risk criteria in their own investment processes. Although the study revealed that central banks are ""conscious of their fiduciary duty"" to the public, just 9% have taken specific measures related to climate risk which go beyond basic requirements within broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks required by most public institutions. Such frameworks require institutions and companies to document the broader impact of their operations on each of these three criteria, and serve as an indicator of future financial performance in terms of risk and reward. Two-thirds of central banks indicated that technical difficulties due to a lack of available benchmarks to represent ESG impact were the key obstacles to including climate considerations in their portfolios. Just over half suggested they would only accept lower returns if the respective benchmark was changed, while 72% indicated they would not be willing to take a more active ownership approach that required greater engagement with companies. Despite the apparent lack of engagement thus far, a detailed report from UBS global sovereign market strategists Massimiliano Castelli and Philipp Salman suggested ""there is growing empirical evidence that climate risk affects the two policy goals pursued by the central banks."" This first of these is physical risk. Extreme weather events and climate pattern disruptions impact financial stability via negative impacts on the banking and insurance sectors, the report suggested. However, such events can also impact the monetary stability goal, as ""they have the potential to increase uncertainty with regards to inflation and growth forecasts which are the basis for the setting of interest rates,"" it added. The second, transition risk, refers to policy evolution through time and across governments on climate risk, which also affects central banks. ""The corporate and financial sectors will have to adapt to the evolving policy and regulatory framework surrounding climate risk - i.e. reduction of CO2 emissions and carbon pricing - but significant uncertainty exists about the forms and the timing of these changes,"" the UBS report stated. ""What is certain is that these policies will create disruption as institutions adapt, potentially impacting both the financial stability and monetary policy goals of central banks."" Climate risk also affects the asset management operations of central banks, as with any other institutional investor's portfolio. States and sectors adjusting to new climate change realities could mean central banks face losses on asset holdings exposed to climate risk, the economists highlighted. Risk mitigation operations, such as re-allocating assets to holdings with less exposure to climate risk or stronger ESG focus, will therefore be necessary. Castelli and Salman highlighted the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China as being at the vanguard of driving green finance measures. Almost half (45%) of respondents to the UBS Annual Reserve Manager Survey 2019 suggested that the inclusion of climate risk criteria in asset management activities would be achieved through an exclusion list. The asset classes where central banks see greater scope for climate risk inclusion are corporate and government bonds. ""The results of our RMS survey hint that most prefer to implement — or, in many cases, have already implemented — a comprehensive ESG framework with the help of established data providers,"" Castelli and Salman wrote. ""A major contribution central banks can provide in the greening of the financial system is to create standards and an international level playing field.""",2019-07-02,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/02/central-banks-key-policy-goals-are-under-threat-from-climate-change-warns-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="

Technology has emerged as a heated battleground in the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict as both countries seek to dominate new areas like 5G and artificial intelligence. Amid that, Chinese internet companies have seen their stocks stumble. Still, John Woods, Credit Suisse's chief investment officer for Asia Pacific, said the sector appears to be a solid bet.

Tan Min Lan, the head of the Asia Pacific Investment Office at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that Chinese internet companies offered ""solid share buyback prospects"" and have high cash flows. Although Chinese tech companies such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have been exposed to U.S.-China trade tensions, Woods pointed out that they are largely focused on the domestic market. ""Clearly we want to focus on those names and those sectors within that broad group which have a profound domestic focus. Actually, the internet stocks do have an overwhelmingly domestic focus. They are not really export-oriented,"" Woods said. ""They're absolutely focused on consumption plays, services plays within the domestic economy and those are the ones we want to focus on."" UBS' Tan, too, pointed to the domestic focus of those stocks as a strength. ""We still like software and services, and we like internet because the bulk of the revenues is generated domestically,"" she said. The KraneShares CSI China Internet exchange-traded fund, which tracks Chinese tech stocks including Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, tumbled in May as the U.S and China ratcheted up tariffs on each other's goods, before rebounding slightly beginning in June. Beyond internet companies, Woods highlighted two other sectors in China that are set to perform well: insurance and infrastructure. Infrastructure will ride on the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate the economy, he said. With the slowing domestic growth, Beijing has ramped up fiscal spending, including in infrastructure projects. As for insurance, the sector will tap on the aging trend in China, Woods said.

This compared to a net profit of 1.28 billion Swiss francs ($1.29 billion) in the second quarter of 2018. The Swiss-lender announced that this is the highest second-quarter net profit since 2010. The profit boost comes in despite declines in both its investment bank and wealth management divisions. Here are some key highlights for the quarter: ""We saw a normalization of the environment coming out of a good March into the rest of the quarter. I'd say the highlights were clearly: diversification paid off again,"" Sergio Ermotti, chief executive officer of UBS told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. UBS shares hovered around the flatline shortly after the market open. UBS, however, saw a decline in its global wealth management business compared to a year ago. The bank reported an operating profit of $886 million compared to over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Profits in its investment bank division also fell from a year ago. It registered an operating profit of $440 million in the second quarter for this year compared to $571 million a year ago. Speaking to CNBC, Ermotti explained that ""the u-turn in the interest rate environment in the U.S. has created pressure."" Market expectations point to an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month. The central bank had embarked on a normalization path in 2015, after the global and sovereign debt crises. However, recent data has shown worsening economic conditions in the U.S. In Europe, the outlook is similar for monetary policy. The European Central Bank (ECB) said in May that if incoming economic data does not show an improvement, then the central bank will be prepared to announce more stimulus. Ermotti told CNBC that he is not sure whether further easing will propel the economy. ""I'm not sure going deeper into negative territory or using the QE (quantitative easing) is the way to get out of the problems…We need more structural answers,"" he said. Ermotti warned ""there are severe broader considerations than just the banking industry"" from low rates. Ermotti's comments come in after the Swiss-lender warned in its latest results that a return to monetary stimulus from various central banks could dent profits going forward. ""A sharp drop in interest rates and expected rate cuts will continue to adversely affect net interest income compared with last year,"" UBS said. However, the Swiss bank expects that a diversified business, stronger investor sentiment and higher market volatility will help offsetting impacts from changes to monetary policy.

Dividend stocks tend to perform well in low interest rate environments and are more stable than earnings, he added. Gold is a historically safe trade when rates are low, stocks are volatile and the dollar is weak. UBS expects the precious metal to breach the $1,600 level in six months and said adding gold can provide stability to investor portfolios. Haefele also said there are opportunities in secular trends as well as put options that allow investors to sell at designated price points.

That will likely make the Chinese economy ""the first in the world"" to get back on track, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. Tay's comments came ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhan on Tuesday, the city where the disease was first reported and the worst hit in the country. It was his first visit since the outbreak in December.  ""Xi Jinping's visit of Wuhan is a symbolic move that shows China is recovering from COVID-19,"" Iris Pang, ING's chief economist for Greater China, told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Tuesday. But Pang expressed caution. ""I am quite wary about this because there are more and more imported cases into China and therefore, the spreading of coronavirus from imported cases and also the recovery of workers work in office and also factories, might also create another wave of coronavirus cases in China,"" she said. ""So I am not that optimistic."" Since being first reported in China, the coronavirus has spread across the globe, infecting nearly 114,000 people globally and taking at least 4,000 lives, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization. Recent weeks have seen particularly severe outbreaks in countries such as Italy, one of the euro zone's largest economies, where quarantine has been expanded to the entire country following a surge in infections and deaths. Asked about the danger of China seeing a resurgence in cases due to the diseases being imported from overseas, Tay from UBS said: ""It's actually easier for the Chinese to control that"" as they can control the airports and ports. ""If you have uncontactable tracing or uncontactable spreads amongst the local population, that is probably a lot more difficult to control,"" he said. Commenting on the potential economic impact of the virus' spread elsewhere, Tay said 60% of China's economy is ""basically domestic consumption,"" adding that this will likely serve as a ""buffer"" if production can be brought back up to speed and consumption begins again. In a bid to stem the spread of the disease, the Chinese government locked down cities and quarantined millions of people, as Beijing declared an extended Lunar New Year holiday and temporarily shut down factories and businesses. Recent economic data have started to point to signs that the world's second-largest economy took a hit during that period. Producer prices in China for February fell 0.4% from a year earlier, Reuters reported Tuesday citing official data. That was worse than expectations of a 0.3% decline by analysts in a Reuters poll. Consumer prices for February rose 5.2% as compared to a year earlier, in line with forecasts by economists polled by Reuters.

"UBS warns there could be an oil price spike to $100 that triggers a US recession","Oil prices have risen above a ""sweet spot"" of between $50 and $70 a barrel that encourages global growth, according to Swiss investment bank UBS.If oil prices rise another $20 to $100 a barrel, UBS said it would dent global growth and send consumer prices higher.UBS said prices could keep rallying for several reasons, putting the U.S. economy at risk of entering a recession.","Oil prices have broken out of a ""sweet spot"" for global economic growth and could herald a U.S. recession if they keep rising, UBS warns. The Swiss investment bank on Tuesday joined a chorus of financial institutions in pondering the economic impact of oil prices at $100 a barrel. Crude futures are trading near their highest levels in 3½ years, bolstered by strong demand, supply cuts from big producers, and mounting geopolitical tension in the Middle East and Venezuela. International benchmark  has surged nearly 48 percent over the last year and has traded above $80 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude is up 43 percent, near $72 a barrel. When oil prices rise sharply, it raises the cost of fuel and shrinks the amount of money consumers have to spend in the broader economy. But when the cost of crude falls too much, it weighs on growth in oil-producing nations. Until recently, oil prices fell in a range between those two poles, according to UBS. ""However, now that we are getting closer to $100/bbl the net impact of higher oil prices is again becoming a net negative,"" UBS economists said in a research note. ""The global sweet spot — where oil prices may have positively contributed to global growth — seems to be somewhere between $50/bbl and $70/bbl."" Oil prices at $100 a barrel would knock UBS' estimate for global growth in 2019 down from 4 percent to 3.86 percent. It says global inflation would top out at 4 percent if prices hit that level, up from the bank's current forecast for a 3.1 percent increase in consumer prices in July. To be sure, those economic impacts would be felt very differently across the globe — UBS assessed the fallout for 15 different nations — but it certainly raises risks in the United States. ""We should take seriously the possibility of an oil price spike ... not least because oil spikes preceded 5 of the last 6 recessions (in the US),"" UBS said. The crude price rally this past year marks the 11th biggest oil price spike in the last 70 years, according to UBS. The bank's economists warn the rally could continue to grind higher for several reasons. A deal among OPEC, Russia and other producers to cut output and drain a crude glut has shrunk oil stockpiles. Meanwhile, geopolitical tension and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela are creating uncertainty about future oil supply. Finally, while U.S. production is surging, it can't keep pace with growing demand, and UBS thinks underinvestment in big oil projects will start to impact supply next year. While this year's spike ranks among the biggest in history, UBS notes that it is still smaller than rallies that preceded recessions in the past. Global oil prices also remain below levels throughout much of 2005-2015, once they're adjusted for inflation. Fuel efficiency improvements also mean the world needs less oil today to produce one unit of economic activity. Another factor that would minimize the impact of higher oil prices is surging U.S. output. Now that the United States accounts for a bigger share of global oil production, it means that the world's biggest economy gets a bigger boost from rising oil prices. Still, UBS says another $20 rise in oil prices won't bring much new production online.",2018-05-23,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/oil-prices-at-100-could-trim-global-growth-trigger-us-recession-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="

A rise in benchmark rates is usually beneficial for the dollar as more people flock to U.S. assets in anticipation of higher yields. But Swiss investment bank and financial services group UBS believes the euro will out-muscle anything the greenback does next year. So far in 2017, the euro is up nearly 11.5 percent against the dollar. ""What matters for dollar is not the timing of the next hike,"" UBS strategists said, but ""how far the Fed is likely to tighten over the cycle; and the market already expects a fair amount."" The strategists, writing in its 2018 global foreign exchange outlook released on Tuesday, said that comparatively the euro ""remains cheap"" and that ""strong growth should catalyse appreciation."" The euro has risen against the dollar this year amid improving economic data and a central bank that has just begun to reduce its mammoth package of monthly asset purchases. Yianos Kontopoulos, UBS' global head of macro strategy and lead author of the outlook, said it had identified the currencies that UBS felt would ""benefit most from a backdrop of solid growth, low but gently rising core inflation, and easy financial conditions that allows room for policymakers to normalize policy further in 2018 without accident."" Here's some more detail from UBS' outlook: The dollar vs. the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen ""We expect the dollar dollar to perform well versus the Canadian dollar (CAD) and Japanese yen in 2018,"" Kontopoulos said. ""The Canadian inflation outlook remains soft, as headwinds from recent CAD strength are likely to persist until the first half of 2018, and this should lead to further CAD weakness, in our view."" Meanwhile, for the greenback versus the yen, UBS said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's super-majority in parliament ""bolsters the chances that the Bank of Japan maintains its accommodative stance."" ""This suggests higher USD/JPY in 2018. As inflation rises, the yield curve target will likely be adjusted upwards, stabilizing the yen and ultimately leading it stronger."" Risk-sensitive currencies When it comes to ""risk-sensitive currencies,"" which tend to depreciate amid increased risk as investors seek perceived safe-haven currencies, UBS said ""some are more attractive than others."" ""In a solid growth and low but gently rising core inflation global environment, we expect risk-sensitive Aussie dollar, the Swedish krona and Norwegian krone to outperform,"" the Swiss bank noted. ""The Australian dollar should continue to find support amid resilient Chinese activity, supportive global financial conditions, and positive risk sentiment for carry. We also maintain our constructive Scandie view, as a solid macro backdrop that benefits further from the European recovery should support gradual appreciation of the Swedish krona and Norwegian krone through 2018."" Sterling and New Zealand dollar Meanwhile, the New Zealand and British pound ""wrestle political uncertainty,"" UBS said, with policy uncertainty in New Zealand following an election in September and ongoing Brexit drin the U.K. weighing on the currencies, respectively. ""We moderate our bullish New Zealand dollar view slightly despite kiwi screening as undervalued and its historically positive exposure to broad global growth. This is because policy uncertainty following the recent election may linger, and limit some of the New Zealand dollar upside,"" UBS said. For sterling, UBS said its bearish view for the pound ""remains intact as a decelerating economy compounds uncertainty around Brexit negotiations.""",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/21/dollar-set-for-rough-2018-as-the-euro-pushes-higher-ubs-predicts.html?&qsearchterm="
"North Korea could account for nearly a quarter of a unified Korean Peninsula's economy one day, UBS says","A peace treaty formally ending the Korean War and opening the North-South border would increase foreign investment, helping the economy, UBS economist Li Zeng and analyst Yong-Suk Son say.North Korea could also then utilize its natural resources and well-educated labor force, the analysts say.The state could then account for up to 24 percent of the Korean Peninsula's total gross domestic product in 20 years under reunification with the South, the report says.","North Korea could account for up to 24 percent of the Korean Peninsula's total gross domestic product in 20 years under reunification with the South, UBS estimated in a report this week. The rogue state currently accounts for 1.1 percent of the regional economy. Tensions around the nuclear state have eased after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un met with the leaders of South Korea and U.S. While it's far from clear whether the two halves of the peninsula will ever reunify, they may be closer to establishing two peaceful, independent states, which by UBS' analysis would also help growth. A peace treaty formally ending the Korean War and opening the North-South border would increase foreign investment, helping the economy, UBS economist Li Zeng and analyst Yong-Suk Son said in a Tuesday report. North Korea could also then utilize its natural resources and well-educated labor force, the analysts said, noting compulsory secondary education. In 2016, nearly half of economic growth came from the industrial sector, just under a third from services, and about a fifth from agriculture, the UBS report said. North Korea's natural resources worth about $4 trillion  ""The current market value of North Korea's known reserves of natural resources is estimated at close to USD4 trillion,"" the analysts said. ""It's about 225 times of North Korea's current GDP (USD17.6 bil in 2017). If well utilized (not fall under the so-called 'resource curse'), these natural resources could provide much needed support to boost North Korea's economic growth."" North Korea remains tiny and backward. Its centralized economy is the only one whose income level has fallen over the past 30 years, for a GDP of under $17 billion versus Vietnam's $205.3 billion in 2016, according to UBS. Survival is highly dependent on China, and sanctions to counter North Korea's nuclear threat have put further pressure on the economy. Nearly 40 percent of North Korea's 25.5 million people live in poverty, according to the World Poverty Clock. In the creation of two peaceful, independent states, North Korea's per capita GDP could multiply at least 8.3 times in 20 years, with an implied annual growth rate of 11.2 percent to 17.4 percent, the UBS report said. Reunification would send that implied annual growth rate to 20.6 percent. ""Is it possible at all for North Korea to deliver such an astonishing growth performance?"" the UBS analysts said. ""It will be very challenging; but taking all the favorable conditions discussed above into consideration, we don't think it's necessarily impossible, although achieving it will likely require much more than just North Korea's own efforts."" The analysts assume South Korea would contribute much of the initial foreign investment, and incur cumulative costs of 10.4 percent of GDP in a two-state result, and 31 percent of GDP under reunification. Overall, that would take North Korea's share of the peninsula's GDP from 1.1 percent to 15.2 percent or 23.5 percent in two decades, respectively. The UBS analysis counts 20 years from the beginning of any possible normalization of North Korean economic relations with the rest of the world — a highly uncertain outcome. Satellite images indicate North Korea is upgrading a nuclear research facility, according to a report Tuesday from analysis website 38 North. The visible additions come despite dictator Kim Jong Un's commitment to complete denuclearization at a historic summit with President Donald Trump earlier this month. The report did note the construction at the facility should not be linked to the denuclearization pledge, and that no change to the status quo is expected unless Pyongyang issues specific orders.",2018-06-27,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/in-20-years-north-korea-could-account-for-nearly-a-quarter-of-a-unifi.html?&qsearchterm="

""Bitcoin is still too unstable and limited to become a viable means of payment or a mainstream asset class,"" UBS strategist Joni Teves wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Owing to its lack of price stability, bitcoin falls short of criteria that need to be satisfied to be considered money."" Among its biggest roadblocks are recent dramatic price swings and some technological limits, according to UBS. The cryptocurrency's price has been marked by peaks and valleys this year. It often varies by hundreds of dollars in a single day and has fallen more than 60 percent since nearing a high of almost $20,000 in December. The digital currency was trading near $7,500 as of Thursday and has fallen roughly 50 percent in 2018, according to data from CoinDesk. Teves looked at the price of bitcoin historically, and found that 70 percent of those price swings were the result of speculative ""momentum-driven"" interest which makes bitcoin ""vulnerable to large moves."" Price volatility has been a non-starter for some investors, but bitcoin has paid off for long-term buyers. Since 2013, bitcoin's annual return has been 216 percent. In comparison, stocks and investment grade bonds have risen 16 percent and 1.6, respectively, according to UBS. On a risk adjusted basis though, bitcoin only modestly beat stocks, Teves found. Still, she said there is no certainty on whether bitcoin's past performance can be repeated. Teves also mentioned technical limits, and something known as scalability, size and speed. Changes by developers to address the issue have been ""insufficient,"" she said. ""Bitcoin cannot handle the volume of transactions processed by mechanisms being used in the real world,"" Teves said.

"UBS repeats: Tesla will lose money on $35,000 Model 3","Tesla Model 3 has a powertrain that appears to be years ahead of competitors.But the $35,000 base model the company originally planned to make is expected to lose money.","Buyers waiting for that long-promised $35,000 Tesla Model 3 sedan probably shouldn't hold their breath. After UBS recently pulled apart a Model 3 and compared its quality and estimated costs with two competitors, UBS analyst Colin Langan said he thinks Tesla will never be able to make money at the $35,000 the company originally planned to charge for an entry-level model designed for the masses. ""This car needs to sell in the low $40,000's to break even, and I think they're a long way from the 25 percent growth margin target, unless they can sell it well over $50,000,"" Langan said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" UBS hired a team of engineers to pull apart three different electric cars to compare their technology and production costs: a new Tesla Model 3, a 2014 BMW i3 and a 2017 Chevy Bolt. The team examined a $49,000 2018 Model 3 and were ""crazy"" about the powertrain, ""highlighting next-gen, military-grade tech that's years ahead of peers,"" Langan said in a note dated Aug. 15. But the costs were higher than expected, and the cars would lose about $6,000 each at Tesla's original plan to sell an entry model at $35,000, he said. It is another sign Tesla may have trouble turning into the mass-market automaker it said it wants to become. Plans to manufacture the lower-cost vehicle have been delayed since its announcement in 2016 as the electric car manufacturer struggled to meet demand. CEO Elon Musk said in May that manufacturing the Model 3 at that price ""right away"" would cause Tesla to ""die."" Instead, Tesla focused on higher-cost versions that yield better margins, and that move may help Tesla post the profit in the third quarter of 2018 Musk said he expected. The cheapest model available now is $49,000, and buyers can add options that hike the price up to $80,000. Langan estimated the profit margin on the $49,000 version UBS tore apart was about 18 percent. The problem is those prices aren't sustainable for a midsize sedan like the Model 3, Langan said. Even though the Model 3 is a battery electric, Langan said at least some of its buyers will also be shopping midsize sedans with internal combustion engines that are priced in the mid-$40,000 range, such as the BMW 3-Series. The UBS engineers gave a breakdown of each car's powertrain and battery, electronic controls, frame and body as well as interior and safety features. They evaluated each part's design, ease of manufacturing and cost. Tesla beat its two competitors in cost, but the Model 3 didn't have as big a lead over the other automakers as UBS had expected. However, some of the Model 3's technology seemed to be far ahead of that found on the Chevrolet and BMW. In particular, Tesla's electric powertrain stood out as exceptionally simple and flexible.   UBS based its estimates on consultations with engineers and industry research. Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Chevrolet and BMW did not comment on the original UBS report.",2018-08-21,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/21/ubs-repeats-tesla-will-lose-money-on-35000-model-3.html?&qsearchterm="

In a note to clients this week, the investment firm said ""store rationalization needs to accelerate meaningfully as online penetration continues to rise."" Assuming online sales' share of total retail sales in the U.S. grows to 25% by 2026, from 16% today, roughly 75,000 more retail doors, excluding restaurants, need to close, analysts Jay Sole and Michael Lasser said. That means for every 1% increase in online penetration, roughly 8,000 to 8,500 stores need to close. A lot of that growth is being fueled by Amazon, which is expected to account for about half of the U.S. e-commerce market. Within that 75,000 number, about 21,000 clothing stores, 10,000 consumer electronics stores, 8,000 home furnishing stores and 1,000 home improvement stores should close, UBS estimated, based on the firm's assumed growth rates of online penetration within each retail subsector. It added about 7,000 grocery stores could close if online grocery penetration rises to 10%, from 2%, by 2026. UBS also analyzed the productivity of stores across the country, which it said accelerated through 2018, based on the amount of sales made per store. However, the firm said: ""We believe this pace of store productivity improvement is unlikely to be sustained in 2019 as the boost from fiscal stimulus fades. ... This will likely lead to an acceleration in physical store closures in the upcoming year."" Already this year, more than 5,000 store closures have been announced by retailers, according to a tracker by Coresight Research.

"UBS chairman: Europe is running out of economic policy options to boost growth","Following a synchronized global downturn last year, Europe is predicted to only achieve a slow rebound, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS said.In many European countries, including Italy and France, there's very little room for governments to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, Weber said.Europe's challenges go beyond the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies to boost growth and into areas such as trade relations with the U.S., innovation and Brexit, according to Weber.","Both emerging markets and the U.S. appear poised to recover from last year's economic stumbles, but problems persist for Europe, according to the head of global financial giant UBS. The continent is predicted to only achieve a slow rebound, Axel Weber, chairman of the Swiss investment bank, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche in Washington D.C. on Thursday. ""We're a bit skeptical about the ability of Europe to use stimulus to come out of this,"" he said. ""I think there is some downside risk in Europe and you have to acknowledge that. So, whilst I do have the main outlook to be a sort of L-shaped recovery, stabilization at a lower level, growth below potential, I don't have the main scenario of a recession."" The International Monetary Fund recently downgraded growth in the euro zone. It now expects the bloc to grow at 1.3 percent in 2019 — lower than its forecast had been six months ago. In many European countries, including Italy and France, there's very little room for governments to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, Weber said. That's because their fiscal deficits are near the upper limit of the 3 percent of GDP that the European Central Bank allows. Only Germany has room for additional fiscal measures, but Berlin will only use it to boost the domestic economy, the UBS chief said. On the monetary policy front, the ECB has pumped trillions of euros into the economy over the past few years to boost inflation and promote growth. Earlier this week, the ECB held interest rates steady. ""What you have to ask yourself is: After years of quantitative easing, is adding more of the same really going to have the same impact on the economy that it did have when they started this? My answer to that is, probably not,"" Weber said. Europe's challenges, according to the UBS chief, go beyond the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies to boost growth. He pointed out three areas: First, European infrastructure and technology developments lag behind the U.S. and China. ""It needs to improve, and therefore needs investment into infrastructure, into digital economy, into 5G technology in order to catch up. They need to catch up fast and therefore they need to start investing now,"" he said. As Beijing and Washington inch closer to a trade deal, U.S. President Donald Trump recently took a swipe at the European Union. On Twitter, he called the EU a ""brutal trading partner with the United States,"" and declared that ""will change."" Trump tweet: Too bad that the European Union is being so tough on the United Kingdom and Brexit. The E.U. is likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States, which will change. Sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you! Weber said Trump's shift in focus to Europe may invite renewed debate on trade relations. ""That all will not help the recovery in Europe because, as we have seen, if there are trade tensions, there's a higher uncertainty. It impacts negatively on investment and consumption and, therefore, it drags out any possible recover,"" he said. Brexit is also set to prolong uncertainty in Europe. While it presently looks unlikely that the U.K. will leave the EU without a deal in place (a so-called hard Brexit), the road ahead remains unclear, according to Weber. Brexit, he said, is still characterized by a huge amount of uncertainty on investment decisions, trade and location decisions. Earlier this week, EU leaders and the U.K. government agreed to a 'flexible extension"" of the Brexit deadline until Oct. 31. The U.K. was initially meant to leave the bloc on March 29 but was granted an extension to April 12 while the British Parliament failed to agree on any exit deal.

The downgrade came after FedEx lowered its full-year 2019 guidance last month for the second time. FedEx CEO Frederick Smith said ""weaker global trade growth trends"" led to the decline in revenue. ""Significant deceleration in Asia airfreight activity over the past six months and a sharp fall in the German PMI data clearly show the challenging environment for Fedex's International Package business and the difficulty in attracting new volume to TNT in Europe,"" UBS analyst Thomas Wadewitz said in a note.

","Shares of Deutsche Bank hit a record low Monday, down nearly 3%, after UBS downgraded the German lender's stock to a ""sell"" rating from ""neutral."" Pointing to tough external events and the low interest rate environment, UBS slashed its price target for Deutsche from 7.80 euros ($7.45) to 5.70 euros. ""We downgrade to sell because we don't expect operating conditions to improve anytime soon. Deutsche remains a levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope,"" UBS analysts said in a research note on Monday. Rising rates are good for banks since they are able to lend out money with a profitable rate of interest. Lower interest rates can restrict a bank's ability to make profits, adding pressure on margins. The German bank saw its stock hit to a record low of 6.673 euros on Monday morning, just days before its annual general meeting. Earlier this month, the shareholder advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) called for stakeholders to issue a vote of no confidence in the management. Deutsche also faces pressure from investors to trim its investment banking division, especially after the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank. Investment banking (IB) is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities. ""With the share price at close to all time lows, spreads and CDS (credit default swaps) stubbornly high and profitability depressed, the urgency to act is high we think,"" UBS said in its note that was published before the share price fall on Monday. ""DB's IB would have been a key beneficiary of a deal with Commerzbank, as it could have helped to drive down funding costs and spreads and balance the overall profile."" Deutsche Bank has been in the news for a variety of negative reasons in the past few years — from settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, to management reshuffles, weak earnings, constant restructuring, merger speculation and steep stock price falls.  Shares of Deutsche Bank are down nearly 5% since the start of this year. The stock is down nearly 40% over a 12-month period and about 75% over a five-year period. Shares were also impacted by a report in the New York Times on Sunday that said Deutsche Bank ignored employees' calls to report Donald Trump transactions to a federal watchdog. Transactions in 2016 and 2017 triggered automated controls at Deutsche Bank meant to catch illicit activity, and compliance workers then prepared what's known as suspicious activity reports that they believed should be sent to the Treasury, according to the Times, which cited five current and former bank employees. But the reports were never filed with the government, the article states. Deutsche Bank denied these reports in a statement on Monday. ""At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious. Furthermore, suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false.""

UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri also flagged potential fallout from a Huawei battle.Apple shares are down 7% for the month as China and the U.S. remain locked in a stalemate on trade.","Slowing iPhone demand, trade war headwinds and possible ripple effects from a Huawei battle don't bode well for Apple, according to a UBS analyst. The Swiss bank cut its 12-month price target on the iPhone maker to $225 — down from a previous $235. Apple closed at $186 Thursday. UBS still has a ""buy"" rating on the stock but cited evidence from a survey of 8,000 people across six countries that suggests consumers are in no rush to upgrade their phones. For iPhones specifically, ""purchase intention"" looked to be stabilizing at a low level in all regions except China, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We believe a slightly lower multiple is prudent given soft smartphone market and ongoing US/China trade issues,"" Arcuri said. Apple shares have taken a beating in May as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a stalemate on trade. Shares are down 7% for the month, as of Tuesday's close. The U.S. raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billions worth of Chinese goods earlier in May, and China retaliated by upping levies on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports. Most of Apple's supply chain is in mainland China, including the iPhone's final assembly by Foxconn. Apple's China business accounted for more than $10 billion — more than 17% of sales — in its fiscal second quarter. Arcuri also said the ""Huawei situation"" could indirectly impact Apple. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a microchip company backed by Microsoft and Dell accused Chinese tech giant Huawei and one of its executives of stealing trade secrets. Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce added the company to Entity List — meaning American companies would need a license to work with Huawei. ""Apple is not directly impacted, but relaxation of some sort is possible,"" Arcuri said. ""Negotiations between US/China are ongoing and an extension has been granted for some critical items, but we do think a nationalistic movement – similar to the one we saw at the time of the arrest of Huawei's CFO in November – seems quite probable and would impact iPhone sales."" UBS isn't the only one cautious on Apple. Earlier on Thursday, Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall said in a note to clients that Apple earnings could drop 29% if the company's products were banned in mainland China. To be sure, Arcuri said Apple would likely rebound in the event those headwinds ease. ""After a year that is impacted by China demand slowdown and elongating replacement cycles, we think iPhones can grow as these headwinds abate,"" Arcuri said. — CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed reporting.

Beijing retaliated and raised levies on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The Trump administration also put Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a blacklist that prevents it from buying from American companies without U.S. government permission. But there's still some impetus for both sides to strike a deal eventually, according to Tan. Trump, facing re-election in 2020, would want to boost his chances while the Chinese leadership would like to eliminate further economic uncertainties, said Tan. ""So, our sense is that you'll still get a deal probably just before 2020,"" she said, adding that any agreement between the U.S. and China must be seen as a ""win-win"" for Beijing — and not viewed as an American ""containment"" on the rise of Chinese power.

The U.S. president also repeated an accusation of China ""cheating"" on trade, though he blamed the situation on past leaders of the world's largest economy. ""The question many clients ask is: So, what about the dollar? Now that the Fed has come down with rates, will the dollar move in the opposite direction?"" Weber said.

"UBS expects low returns and high volatility for the next decade","Equity returns are expected to be ""much lower"" than in the last decade, with UBS expecting 4%-6% nominal returns per year in developed markets, in local currency terms.With interest rates remaining broadly low, dollar-denominated high-grade bonds are expected to return around 2.5% a year over the next decade, with euro and Swiss franc (CHF) bonds bringing slightly negative returns.","UBS is predicting a decade of low returns and higher volatility for most financial assets. In a report published Thursday, the Swiss bank set out a vision for 2030 which included working-age populations in developed countries shrinking by 25 million, increasing deglobalization and a ""less favorable political backdrop"" for high-income individuals. The anticipated ""decade of transformation"" will mean ""lower returns and high volatility"" for most assets compared to the past decade, meaning investors targeting a given level of return ""may therefore need to increase their allocation to riskier assets such as equities,"" according to Mark Haefele, CIO of UBS Global Wealth Management. The report projected that with the percentage of wealth in the U.S. owned by the top 0.1% approaching the same as that held by the bottom 90% for the first time since the 1930s, wealth redistribution policies will likely grow in popularity over the next decade. ""Left-leaning parties in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. are proposing increasingly radical prescriptions for addressing income and wealth inequality,"" UBS economists said. Causes of inequality have included lower corporate tax rates, automation, globalized supply chains and the rise of ""capital-light superstar firms."" These are businesses which do not require a great deal of capital to get off the ground, but have the potential to grow at rapid rates, such as web-based start-ups. ""Although voters in the months to come will provide an indication of whether wealth concentration has yet hit its political limits, investors should prepare for some combination of higher taxation, greater regulation, and antitrust measures over the next decade,"" UBS added. The lender also suggested the role of monetary policy will evolve into what Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio has called ""monetary policy 3 (MP3)."" Here, fiscal policy assumes a greater role in stimulating economies alongside monetary policy, with the most extreme example being central banks ""handing over printed banknotes directly to consumers and governments,"" the report hypothesized. ""Such policy could result in higher consumption, government spending, and economic growth, or end in inflationary catastrophe."" Equity returns are expected to be ""much lower"" than in the last decade, with UBS expecting 4%-6% nominal returns per year in developed markets, in local currency terms. This is primarily due to modest economic growth, contracting profit margins and ageing populations. However, equities should still return more than most other asset classes, particularly emerging markets, which UBS estimated will return around 9% annually in USD terms thanks to better potential for long term profit growth, though volatility will remain high. With interest rates remaining broadly low, dollar-denominated high-grade bonds are expected to return around 2.5% a year over the next decade, with euro and Swiss franc (CHF) bonds bringing slightly negative returns. Emerging market dollar-denominated sovereign bonds are expected to yield around 4.9% a year.

"The Fed could cut interest rates 3 times this year, UBS predicts","The U.S. Federal Reserve could lower interest rates three times in 2020, Swiss wealth giant UBS predicted.Arend Kapteyn, global head of economic research at UBS, said tariffs implemented in the U.S.-China trade war is expected to drag down U.S. growth to just 0.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2020.Still, he stressed that the impact from tariffs could just be temporary and that the U.S. is not headed into a recession.","Swiss wealth giant UBS has predicted that the U.S. Federal Reserve could lower interest rates three times in 2020 — a forecast that differs widely from many other projections calling for no change or just one rate cut this year. Arend Kapteyn, global head of economic research at UBS, said on Tuesday that tariffs implemented in the trade war between Washington and Beijing would drag down U.S. growth to just 0.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. The U.S. last raised tariffs on Chinese goods in September, with China following up with its own duty increase on a variety of American products. Further tariff hikes initially scheduled for December were put off as both sides agreed to hammer out the so-called phase one trade deal. ""We think this tariff damage is going to push U.S. growth down ... that's actually going to trigger three Fed cuts, which is way off consensus, nobody believes that,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" from the UBS Greater China Conference in Shanghai. The CME FedWatch tool places the probability of the Fed standing pat on interest rates at more than 50% through September. For the central bank's meetings in November and December, that probability falls to 47% and and 40.5%. The tool is based on futures pricing from live markets and reflects the views of traders placing real bets on the CME exchange. Kapteyn noted that Fed officials themselves have shown little inclination to make any moves, with meeting minutes indicating that they're at ""a comfortable hold"" and would want to see ""a material downshift in the data"" before reassessing their position. ""We think they're going to get that downshift. I think you need quite a bit of additional evidence though before they get there. So, we're thinking first cut maybe in March but we really need to see ... loss of growth momentum,"" he said. Still, Kapteyn stressed that the impact from tariffs could just be temporary and that the U.S. is not headed into a recession.

"UBS names upcoming emerging markets elections to watch","Emerging markets investors are keeping tabs on political movements ahead of elections in several developing economies this year.UBS highlighted the upcoming elections of Russia, Mexico, Colombia, Hungary, Malaysia and Brazil as having ""the potential to move markets.""The fairness and legitimacy of several of the elections are likely to be disputed due to lack of transparency and weakness of democratic institutions.","As Europe prepares for the outcome of Italy's highly consequential election on March 4, emerging markets investors are keeping tabs on political movements further afield ahead of elections in several developing economies this year. One top investment bank has laid out the big ones to watch: Russia, Mexico, Colombia, Hungary, Malaysia and Brazil. These elections ""have the potential to move markets,"" according to UBS' Chief Investment Office, which published the list this week in its EM Electoral Monitor. Ranging from the politically opaque — like Russia's election, which has been widely criticized for being undemocratic — to more free and fair, the bank presented its base cases for the contests' outcomes and how they might impact those country's assets. CNBC takes a look at the assessments of Russia, Mexico and Hungary. Western governments and transparency organizations alike heavily dispute the legitimacy of Russia's upcoming election on March 18. Many question whether it should be called an election at all — the most viable opposition candidates have been barred from running, dissent is often met with force and the press is heavily state-monitored. The incumbent Vladimir Putin, having already served as president of the Russian Federation for 12 years in two separate terms and prime minister for eight year in between, has a virtually certain victory ahead of him. UBS reports his contenders poll at a combined total of 16 percent of the vote. Continuation of the status quo is the most likely outcome investors can rely on, with shifts in the Russian economy more likely to be influenced by global energy prices and economic sanctions than any upcoming elections. Russia's GDP growth, which saw mild recovery in 2017 after a two-year recession, is expected to improve at a modest rate. Still, its growth potential remains low due to structural issues, low oil prices and Western sanctions. Any chance of meaningful structural reforms, UBS believes, will rather come if reformist politicians are appointed to the role of prime minister or to the cabinet. July 1 will see both presidential and legislative elections in Mexico. While the outcome is still largely a toss-up, UBS predicts Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, or AMLO, from the leftwing Morena party as the most likely winner. This could move markets as the former Mexico City mayor plans to champion a turn against neoliberal economics and pursue greater state involvement in the economy. AMLO's left-leaning agenda would aim to end the privatization of Mexican state oil company Pemex and the country's electricity industry, bringing ""changes to the status quo and unorthodox macro policies"" that would ""likely weigh on Mexican assets,"" UBS said. Meanwhile, victories for either of the two other contenders — Mexico's center-right PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) and PAN (National Action Party) — would be more reassuring to investors. Either would imply continuity of the current macro policy, thereby entailing ""smoother sailing for the Mexican economy and asset prices,"" the UBS investment office said. The bank expects Mexico to ""exhibit resilience to shocks"" and carry on with strong exports to offset lower oil output. The central European manufacturing hub is set to vote in parliamentary elections on April 8, and analysts have slated the right-wing party of firebrand incumbent leader Viktor Orban to win easily. This would cement the status quo, and investors so far don't expect asset prices to change. The country of 10 million enjoys a current account surplus and positive foreign investment flows. Orban's Fidesz Party has since 2010 pursued a nationalist-populist agenda that pushes hard against immigration and Islam, and is at frequent loggerheads with the EU. Labeled by some as the ""troublemaker of Europe"", Orban has drawn criticism from international observers who say he's weakened the country's democratic institutions. Still, a Fidesz victory would ensure continuity for investors. UBS predicts no major changes to the government's policies, likely continuation of low budget deficit and ""a further reduction of external vulnerabilities, but also likely continued differences with EU partners."" In a surprising development, Orban's party lost a local by-election over the weekend in a small town whose votes are  said to be the bellwether for future political outcomes. While less likely, an alternative victory by a coalition of opposition parties could still happen, creating uncertainty that would weigh on investor sentiment toward Hungarian assets, UBS said. While just a few of the many big elections scheduled for the coming months, these results could have significant repercussions if new governments pursue significantly different agendas than their predecessors. After all, uncertainty is the biggest worry for most investors. But 2017, full of political surprises, showed that markets are surprisingly resilient to politics. UBS advised investors to keep in mind that ""what ultimately drives markets are expected changes in economic and corporate fundamentals."" Other major contests to watch out for will be taking place in Colombia, Malaysia, Brazil, Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq, among others, although the fairness and legitimacy of some are bound to be disputed due to lack of transparency and weakness of democratic institutions.",2018-02-27,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/ubs-names-upcoming-emerging-markets-elections-to-watch.html?&qsearchterm="

Those efforts in making the U.S. a more business-friendly economy, which include the recently passed tax reform, are often under-appreciated, said Mike Ryan, UBS Wealth Management's chief investment officer for Americas. But the president has ""changed the perception of what's possible in Washington,"" he said at the bank's client gathering in Singapore. ""I think prior to his election, the prospects of tax reform, of regulatory relief, or any sort of sensible approach to infrastructure were off the table,"" said Ryan, who added that Trump defied those expectations by getting the new tax bill passed. The president deserves ""high marks"" for his economic achievements so far, Ryan added. Before the bill was passed in December 2017, the U.S. tax code was ""very inefficient,"" he said. Heavy regulation in the U.S. that businesses faced was also not an environment that gives confidence to investors, he added. The reform, which drastically cuts corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, was therefore a positive development even as the new tax code is ""not everything that we hoped for,"" Ryan said. Despite that, the Trump administration remains a key risk that the bank is watching, according to Mark Haefele, UBS Wealth Management's global chief investment officer. Protectionist policies and a conflict with North Korea could derail the current ""Goldilocks"" environment. A ""Goldilocks"" scenario is one where growth is healthy, inflation is low and financial conditions are accommodative.

Meanwhile, Dow Futures pointed to a triple-digit dive ahead of Thursday's open. Speaking at the IMF-World Bank meeting in Bali on Thursday, UBS Chairman Axel Weber told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore that investor mood has flipped from one extreme to another.

Weber added that he recognized global growth was in a late cycle phase, but he did not expect to see a global economic recession and that UBS was set to remain overweight in its equity allocation. Noting that the risk of a trade war was real, Weber added that investors should recognize that the rhetoric from Washington and Beijing would likely have a short-term impact.

Alphabet's self-driving car unit could book $114 billion in revenue in 2030, according to a base-case estimate from investment bank UBS. In its self-driving taxi test in the suburbs around Phoenix, Waymo will charge a small number of people fares competitive with rides Lyft and Uber. But as Waymo adds more cars and locations, it could also license its maps and an autonomous vehicle operating system to other service or car-markers, or monetize the eyeballs of riders through entertainment or advertising, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan writes in a note to clients on Thursday. To put that $114 billion into perspective, Intel released a study in June of last year that projected that the self-driving space would generate $800 billion in cumulative revenue by 2035. UBS's estimate only included Waymo's revenue from robotaxi-related services, though Sheridan believes it has opportunities in logistics and commercial delivery as well. Aside from Waymo, a host of other tech and auto companies are racing to launch their own self-driving taxi services, including GM's Cruise and Uber. While Waymo's technology is widely seen as the most advanced, as highlighted by its Wednesday launch, there are still a host of regulatory and safety concerns on the table. Waymo's pilot will still include safety drivers to supervise rides, for example, at least initially. Overall, UBS pegs Waymo's total value between $25 and $135 billion, with a base case valuation of $75 billion.

UBS cut Coke from buy to neutral, even while raising the price target from $50 to $51, implying 3.6 percent upside from Wednesday's close. Shares were up marginally Thursday. ""KO is a stock for stable earnings growth to ride out defensive times but change is in the air as price increases set-in, the company pursues a transformational non-core deal (Costa), refranchising nears completion and a new CFO takes the helm,"" UBS said in a research note. The company in August announced the $5.1 billion purchase of Costa, an international coffee chain with more than 3,800 locations worldwide. The deal is likely to close in the first half of 2019 and will allow Coke to compete in both the hot and cold drink spaces, though it's unlikely Costa spots will open in the U.S. anytime soon. With six deals behind it in 2018, Coke CEO James Quincy told CNBC earlier this week that investors shouldn't expect the same pace to continue in the year ahead.

"Global growth seen lower in 2019, UBS says, but it's not all bad","Global economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019, according to UBSTighter monetary policy, weaker earnings growth and political challenges are confronting major economiesUBS expects global economic growth to slow to 3.6 percent in 2019","Global economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019, according to UBS, as tighter monetary policy, weaker earnings growth and political challenges confront the world's major economies. After seeing a growth of 3.8 percent in 2018, UBS said in its outlook for the year ahead that it expected global economic growth to slow to 3.6 percent in 2019. ""Our outlook is that U.S. growth will be constrained by ebbing fiscal stimulus and higher interest rates,"" economists at UBS said in a note Wednesday. China, meanwhile, is facing the twin pressures of import U.S. tariffs and economic rebalancing. ""The decline in global growth will mean a weaker tailwind for global markets, which could begin to anticipate an end of the economic cycle as 2019 progresses,"" the investment bank said. In the meantime, solid domestic demand in the euro zone will not be sufficient to offset reduced export growth, the bank said. On the bright side, UBS said a recession looks unlikely given current rates of consumption, investment and employment growth ""and we think the typical causes of a downturn are unlikely to materialize in 2019."" ""Our base case is for inflation to stay contained, allowing central bankers to remain sensitive to growth. We don't foresee a major fiscal policy shift or a commodity price shock. Consumer balance sheets are in solid shape and improvements in banking sector capitalization since the financial crisis reduce the risk of a global credit crunch."" It also noted that there are growth opportunities and pockets of value. ""Economic and earnings growth are waning in aggregate. But this slowdown will not be felt uniformly by every country, sector, or company,"" economists said. ""We expect robust growth in firms exposed to secular trends like population growth, aging, and urbanization. Meanwhile, some assets have already begun to factor in a more challenging backdrop."" Among the biggest challenges facing the world's largest economies is a new era of tighter monetary policy following a decade of stimulus after the financial crisis of 2008. Central banks in the U.S., U.K., euro zone, Japan and elsewhere introduced a mixture of low interest rates and expansionary monetary stimulus programs, known as ""quantitative easing"" (QE) — essentially large-scale asset purchases — in a bid to boost spending in the economy. While these tools were useful in re-establishing stability in global financial systems, central banks are keen to ""normalize"" such policies. The U.S. has already stopped its QE program and hiked interest rates four times in 2018 while the European Central Bank confirmed in December that QE would end at the end of the month, with bond purchases falling from 15 billion euros ($17 billion) a month to zero. Amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty, meanwhile, the Bank of England has yet to say when its own QE program will end, although interest rates have been raised slightly. UBS noted that the coming year will represent the first time since the global financial crisis when central bank balance sheets are on track to end the year smaller than they were at the start of it. The Federal Reserve last raised its benchmark interest rate in December from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. UBS said it expected U.S. rates to be 100 basis points higher (at 3.5 percent) by the end of 2019, adding that low and falling unemployment rates also increase the risk of higher inflation, which could spark even faster rate rises. The prediction of lower global growth comes at an already gloomy time for global equity markets, with shares falling on fears of a potential worldwide economic slowdown and worries around the pace of central bank tightening. In 2018, U.S. stock indexes posted their worst year since 2008 while Europe's pan-European Stoxx 600 also suffered its worst year in a decade. UBS noted that tighter monetary policy will focus market attention particularly on debt serviceability. ""Potential hotspots include U.S. and Chinese corporate leverage and Italian government debt,"" it said. It sees profit growth in the U.S. market, which comprises more than half of the global equity market, falling off to roughly 4 percent in 2019 from an eight-year high of 21 percent in 2018. UBS said it anticipated 9 percent earnings growth in emerging markets and around 5 percent in the euro zone. Noting the limited long-term return potential, UBS said investors would have to ""temper their expectations"" in the coming years. The bank said the one-off boost from corporate tax cuts which were instigated by President Donald Trump in 2017 will not be repeated, and tit-for-tat tariffs on imports between China and the U.S. will begin to have a negative impact on the economy.

Other political events that UBS thinks investors should take into account this year are elections in India, South Africa, Greece, Canada, and Argentina.

The investment bank thinks shares of Chevron could rise as much as 21 percent based on its 12-month price target of $135. The stock popped $1.65, or 1.5 percent, to $113.61 on Friday. Oil prices plunged more than 40 percent from peak to trough in the final quarter of 2018. UBS says the volatility shows the value of a ""conservative"" and ""sustaining business and financial model"" embodied by Chevron. Despite a 12 percent drop in Chevron's stock price during the oil price pullback, ""we believe that that the intrinsic value of the shares is materially unaffected; that the financial and operating model of Chevron is explicitly constructed to cope with this type of volatility; and that absent a material and structural change in the oil market (which we don't believe is the case) the share price weakness offers an interesting entry point,"" UBS analyst Jon Rigby wrote in a research note on Friday. UBS highlights Chevron's ability to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments with Brent crude futures at $50 a barrel — about $12 below the current price. The bank says capital expenditures remain ""generous"" and Chevron's debt relative to equity is low compared to peers, giving the company the ability to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Chevron's asset portfolio is also ""enviable,"" in the bank's view. The start-up of liquefied natural gas projects will help the company generate cash, while it's ""industry-leading"" position in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. shale oil field, reduces risks. That gives Chevron time to consider investments in capital-intensive fuel refining facilities and offshore oil and gas projects.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/chevron-upgraded-at-ubs-a-safe-haven-stock-amid-volatile-oil-prices.html?&qsearchterm="
"Global market liquidity could 'freeze like the water in Davos,' UBS' Ermotti says","Swiss bank chief Sergio Ermotti has warned that financial liquidity in global markets should not be assumed. Speaking on the same Davos panel J.P. Morgan's asset and wealth management chief said a lack of liquidity is “what we all worry about.”","Assumptions about global liquidity are wrong and market activity could freeze up quickly, according to the chief executive of Swiss bank UBS. Last month, the Dow and S&P 500 equity indices recorded their worst December performance since 1931 - the era of the Great depression. It was also the biggest of any monthly loss since February 2009. Stocks got dumped amid concerns of an economic slowdown and fears the Federal Reserve might be tightening conditions to a point where liquidity in markets could dry up. For investors, liquidity is the ability to sell an asset reasonably quickly and at a price close to where it last traded. Speaking Thursday, on a CNBC-moderated panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, UBS chief executive officer, Sergio Ermotti, said the December sell off was due to a convergence of macro and political fears as well as a growing understanding that the financial system may not let investors move capital as easily as before. ""The implied assumption that we hear about liquidity being there, being able to step in and function the levelling out tensions, is the wrong assumption,"" he said before adding ""liquidity can freeze very easily, like the water in Davos."" Ermotti said that among its US investor base at the end of the fourth quarter in 2018, there was an historic high of 24 percent cash asset allocation as investors pulled back from the market. ""This is not liquidity that is there for reinvestment. This is there because people fear that things will go wrong,"" he warned. The Swiss banker said many of the world's bigger investors were now managing money for others and, unlike banks, they not might stand by willing and able to trade an asset just to ensure markets run smoothly. The panel, moderated by CNBC's Geoff Cutmore, also included Mary Callahan Erdoes, J.P. Morgan's asset & wealth management chief executive. The asset allocator, who also sits on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Investor Advisory Committee, said a lack of liquidity is ""what we all worry about."" Callahan Erdoes told the Davos audience that since 2008, an additional $11 trillion worth of assets had been pumped into the financial system which had thrown up strange pricing levels. As an example, the U.S. banker noted the situation in 2017 when 85 percent of the Italian high yield market traded below the yield of U.S. treasuries. In typical conditions, the yield on U.S. treasuries should be lower than Italian high yield as it is considered a much safer investment. The J.P. Morgan executive said these market anomalies ought to ""get cured"" when the capital was eventually redeployed but warned that people could find danger amid a lack of market makers and a gap in liquidity. The Volcker rule — a post-crisis regulation to curb banks making big bets with their own money — has been criticized by banks for reducing market liquidity. Others see it as a necessary piece of regulation to ensure that financial institutions cannot repeat the financial meltdown of 2008. Callahan Erdoes said with the diminished role of the banks and investment dealers as investors and market makers, it would then fall to the shadow banking system, such as private equity and hedge funds, to grease the wheels of the global market. ""They have a lot of capital that could be deployed but they are not going to go in to make markets in the way banks used to. They are going in as a fiduciary, to make money for their investors, and those are the dynamics that everyone is struggling with,"" she said.",2019-01-25,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/ubs-ermotti-market-liquidity-could-freeze-like-the-water-in-davos-.html?&qsearchterm="

The note said that although there was a ""growing desire"" to transition away from fossil fuels, ""demand for most energy resources, including fossil fuels"" would continue to rise. It added that while renewable fuel supplies were set to increase at a fast pace, diversification from non-renewable resources would be expensive and time consuming, ""Despite growing aspirations to diversify away from fossil fuels, we think demand for most energy resources, including oil, coal, and natural gas, is likely to keep rising over the coming decade,"" the UBS analysts said in the research. ""We believe supplies of renewable energy will keep rising at an unprecedented pace over the next few decades.

The environmental benefits of renewable sources of energy were cited as the ""key motivator"" for the development of renewables in the near term. The note said that diversification would be needed to ""mitigate the risk of instability in energy availability and pricing.""

That's likely to impact the weakened pound, he said. Johnson, who won the race to the lead country on Tuesday, previously said the U.K. must leave the European Union by Oct. 31 ""do or die, come what may."" But that may not continue to be his outlook as he weighs the best path forward. ""Being a prime minister, things can change, and so maybe we also think about a little bit of an extension to the Brexit negotiation,"" Dominic Schnider, head for commodities and Asia Pacific foreign exchange at UBS Global Wealth Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" Should Johnson soften his perspective on Brexit, there will be consequences for the British pound, Schnider projected. ""If the market realizes that the hard Brexit probability starts to shrink, I think the pound can come back. So we're probably going to trade north of $1.30, $1.35, somewhere there,"" Schnider said. The pound closed at $1.2436 on Tuesday, edging near the two-year trough of $1.2382 it brushed last week. The pound is down more than 13% since the U.K. voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016.  Recent sterling lows have been attributed to Johnson's insistence on Brexit. ""In our view, Johnson's desire to push for Brexit, deal or no deal, increases the chance of an early general election and some possibly (of) nasty GBP outcomes,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a recent note. A reduced probability of an upcoming British election, due to disagreements on Brexit between Parliament and Johnson, could also give the pound a lift, Schnider told CNBC. However, he noted that it wasn't necessarily the election's outcome that would make a difference to sterling. What's more important for traders, he said, is the sentiment about whether ""the U.K. and European Union jointly try to solve this issue and not depart in an unfriendly way."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit, which investors are concerned will happen come Halloween, will mean the U.K. leaves the European bloc without reaching a formal deal. That is, there would be no transitional period for the British government to negotiate free trade deals.

In fact, the S&P 500 has fallen slightly since the central bank delivered the first rate reduction in more than a decade in July. That's because the correlation between the S&P 500's price-earnings ratio and the Fed funds rate has broken due to the long period of low rates since the early 2000s, UBS noted ""Fed rate cuts are not likely to fuel equities higher as they did in the 1990s,"" UBS equity strategist Francois Trahan said in a note on Tuesday. ""The Fed-easing rallies of the 1990s were made possible by a strong inverse correlation between interest rates and P/Es. This relationship no longer exists today."" Stocks just finished a volatile third quarter with the S&P 500 still eking out a small gain. Investors had a choppy ride over the past few months with the escalated trade war taking a bite from the economy. The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in August, its first decline since 2016, according to a gauge from the Institute for Supply Management. ISM's new export orders also slowed to their lowest reading since April 2009, which is an important signal as the decline has historically been coincided with S&P 500 earnings growth turning negative, the analyst pointed out. ""Investor sentiment has been resilient in the face of the ISM crossing below 50 in August. We believe this resilience in sentiment is explained by the widespread belief that Fed rate cuts will help support S&P 500 P/Es as they did in the 1990s,"" Trahan said. Traders are now pricing in a 40% chance of a rate cut at the end of October and about a 67% probability of at least one rate reduction in December, according to CME FedWatch tool. Optimism for a rate-cut rally should be further diminished in the face of heightened political uncertainty, Trahan warned.

","The chairman of Switzerland's largest bank is seeing what he calls an investor strike as the confusion and uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the EU intensifies. ""I think you've seen, with Brexit but also with the trade disputes, that there has been an enormous increase in uncertainty,"" UBS Chairman Axel Weber told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore on Saturday. ""Uncertainty has been bad for investments all along. What you're seeing at the moment ⁠— and we're seeing it in our client base ⁠— is almost an investor strike."" The German investment banker's comments came during the 2019 Annual International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, D.C., where discussions focused heavily on global economic turmoil caused by trade wars, protectionism and political instability. ""The way I look at that is while interest rates are very very low, and the costs of investment are at historic lows, the increased uncertainty about whether those projects will pay off, whether rejigging your whole production chain will pay off, by having parts of that production chain be in China ⁠— or for Europeans, in the U.K. ⁠— is a huge uncertainty,"" Weber said. ""And people will not take these decisions until the political decisions are taken."" S&P Global Ratings calculated in the spring that Brexit had, by last April, cost the U.K. economy $86 billion. The uncertainty following the vote led to a dramatic decrease in the value of the pound, increased inflation, a fall in household spending power, weak exports, declining real estate prices and the stalling of local and foreign investment. In the latest developments, Britain has requested yet another extension of the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union — which would be the third extension since the June 2016 referendum — after U.K. lawmakers delayed a vote Saturday on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The lawmakers voted to activate a law that required Downing Street to ask Brussels to push back the deadline for Brexit, despite Johnson's vocal objection to another extension. But EU leaders don't have to accept the extension request, and there are a number of ways they could respond. They could offer a technical extension of a few weeks in the hope of passing the recently-negotiated agreement with Johnson; they could agree to push the date back to January 31, opening the door to a U.K. general election and a potential second referendum; or they could refuse the extension request altogether, possibly triggering an economic crisis for both the U.K. and EU. EU Council President Donald Tusk said he received the extension letter and that he would begin consulting with EU leaders on how to respond to Britain's request. Meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said Sunday morning that the U.K. would indeed leave the EU by October 31, adding yet more confusion to the outlook. Despite all this, Weber is ""more positive that we'll see an orderly Brexit,"" he told CNBC Saturday. ""But investors still want to see it on the table. They have been, too many times the project has been delayed, and they're just holding out and waiting for investment. And you can see how investment in the U.K. has fallen off a cliff, and that is not good as a dynamic part of the economy.""

""We expect shares will come under modest initial pressure given the departure of such a unique talent and visionary, but quickly return to trading on expectations for near-term fundamentals,"" the Swiss lender said in a client note Tuesday. Shares of the company fell 1.35 percent overnight after Schultz delivered a memo to employees on Monday announcing his departure as executive chairman. Credited with building the modern Starbucks, Schultz joined the iconic coffee chain in 1982 as director of operations and marketing, and it has since become a globally recognized brand with more than 28,000 locations around the world. This week's price dip follows a downward slide of nearly 12 percent for the company's stock price over the last year, thanks mainly to struggling same-store sales in the U.S. This will be a near-term focus for the brand, but earnings-per-share (EPS) will become increasingly attractive as the trajectory of same-store sales improves, UBS said. Earnings-per-share is a key metric used by traders to gauge a stock's value. Schultz has been considered a leader in the corporate world in terms of pairing social responsibility with financial results, initiating projects including charities, free college tuition for employees, and hiring programs for refugees, veterans and military spouses. UBS expects these values to continue providing a competitive advantage for the brand in domestic and international markets as consumers, particularly millennials, become more ethically conscious in their spending choices. ""Despite recent headwinds, we believe the brand remains well positioned for sustained long-term growth in key U.S. and China growth markets. We expect Starbucks' multi-year strategy is unlikely to significantly change following (Monday's) announcement,"" the note said. UBS forecasts the coffee chain will ""maintain U.S. and global coffee category outperformance,"" with multiple sales initiatives enabling what it predicts as 2 to 4 percent same-store sales growth annually over the next few years. It added that while the magnitude and timing of Americas sales improvements remains the near-term challenge, ""against low expectations and valuation, we believe downside is relatively limited."" The bank continues to view Starbucks as one of the higher-quality growth stores in the large-cap consumer category with ""robust global store development and return of capital opportunities."" Myron E. Ullman, former chairman and CEO of J.C. Penney, will replace Schultz as the next chair of the company's board. Under Schultz's leadership, the stock has grown 21,000 percent since its initial public offering in 1992. He currently owns 37.8 million shares of Starbucks, or a 3 percent stake, worth about $2.17 billion. Speculation is now rife as to the outgoing chairman's political ambitions, with rumors that he may be considering a presidential bid. In his memo to company employees, Schultz wrote, ""I'll be thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I'm a long way from knowing what the future holds."" —CNBC's Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.",2018-06-05,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/starbucks-is-still-a-buy-despite-chairman-howard-schultz-leaving-ubs-says.html?&qsearchterm="
"Bitcoin is a 'speculative bubble' and unlikely to become a real currency, UBS says","Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are in a ""speculative bubble,"" according to UBSThe investment bank said that it is ""highly doubtful"" that these will ever become mainstream currenciesBut blockchain technology could have a ""significant impact"" on many industries, UBS says","Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are in a ""speculative bubble"" and are unlikely to become mainstream currencies, according to UBS.  There are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies, bitcoin being the biggest by market capitalization, and many have seen huge rises in value over the past few years. Bitcoin for example is up over 470 percent year-to-date. ""We think the sharp rise in cryptocurrency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble,"" UBS wrote in a white paper published last week.  The investment bank said that it is ""highly doubtful"" that these will ever become mainstream currencies. ""The need for companies and individuals to pay tax receipts in government-issued currency, and the potentially unlimited crypto-money supply, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption,"" the note said. UBS said that governments set taxes and this is the largest single income for almost any economy. Therefore, people will always want government-backed currencies to pay tax. Even though a company could accept cryptocurrency as payment, it would need to pay different taxes in government-backed currency. And so the company would be taking an exchange rate risk. ""If governments refuse to accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments, the single most important transaction in an economy, that significantly reduces demand for cryptocurrencies. Governments are highly unlikely to ever take this step,"" UBS said. Currencies also act as a store of value, which is achieved when supply of currency matches demand, according to the note. But this is not possible with cryptocurrencies as supply cannot go down. And while the supply of individual cryptocurrencies cannot be readily changed, the overall supply of them can be ""infinitely increased"" by the creation of new virtual currencies. ""The possibility of limitless supply of different cryptocurrencies creates the risk of further collapses in value. If a new cryptocurrency were created which is easier to 'mine,' and which allows more transactions to take place more quickly, demand for that cryptocurrency might naturally increase,"" UBS analysts said. ""Existing cryptocurrencies would likely see demand fall; a cryptocurrency that has been superseded by a new cryptocurrency with superior technology has little value. As the supply of existing cryptocurrencies cannot fall to match the decline in demand, the result would be a collapse in the value of existing cryptocurrencies."" UBS described what makes a ""bubble"" in any asset and concluded that cryptocurrencies, with their massive price rises, meet the definition. ""The relatively high volume of cryptocurrency turnover, against limited real-world use, suggests that many buyers are seeking speculative gain, never intending to use cryptocurrencies to make a real-world transaction,"" the investment bank said. ""With each of the other characteristics of typical bubbles in evidence, a twenty-fold increase in bitcoin prices in just two years, and an absence of any fundamental economic backing, cryptocurrency prices are almost certainly a bubble."" UBS is not the only organization in the banking world to pour cold water over cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon has previously called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that ""won't end well."" Despite its skepticism on cryptocurrencies, UBS said blockchain technology is likely to have a ""significant impact"" on a number of industries.  The blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. In the case of bitcoin, its a distributed ledger that records all transactions. It is tamper-proof and the technology is hailed as something that could be used in a number of different processes across many industries. For example, it could be used in trade finance to create ""smart contracts"" where a deal goes through automatically once certain conditions are met by all the parties involved. The promise of blockchain is that it could make processes more secure and faster. Groups such as R3 or the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which contain a number of banks, are currently exploring how this could work.  ""Investing in the blockchain wave is akin to investing in the internet in the mid-nineties. Blockchain could lead to significant disruptive technologies in the coming decade,"" UBS said. ""But for the time being, technological shortcomings still need to be resolved, it remains unclear which specific applications will prove most useful/profitable, and actual revenue and profitability associated with the industry is currently limited.""",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/bitcoin-is-speculative-bubble-and-unlikely-to-become-a-currency-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="

The chief executive at UBS, one of the world's biggest managers of billionaires' money, described stocks as not yet priced to perfection but getting close. ""You can still see value in equities"" for the time being. Ermotti also told CNBC that UBS is putting more emphasis on catering to high net-worth investors in the U.S. and even more so in Asia. He said the firm is following the money. In the Americas, UBS has 7,000 advisors who contribute 33 percent of their profits before taxes. In Asia, the company has fewer advisors, roughly 1,100, who contribute 27 percent of the profits before taxes. ""In Asia, you have to think that we basically bank with one out of two billionaires in the region,"" Ermotti said. ""Every four days in China, there is a new billionaire. Last year, the numbers of billionaires in China really [overtook] the U.S. And in [a] few years' time, they're going to have more wealth than the U.S."" Some of that wealth in Asia may find its way to U.S. and Europe, he said.

"UBS predicts a 'solid performance' for the rest of the year after reporting 9% rise in second quarter net profit","Swiss bank UBS announced a 9 percent rise in net profit in the second quarter of the year.Rising interest rates in the U.S. should further support its global wealth management unit.UBS bought back 550 million Swiss francs worth of its own shares.","Swiss bank UBS announced a net profit of 1.28 billion Swiss francs ($1.29 billion) in the second quarter, a 9 percent increase from a year ago, the bank said Tuesday. UBS pointed said solid global growth had helped its performance and added that expectations of monetary policy tightening in the U.S. should further support its global wealth management unit, though gradually. Here are some key highlights: The bank had reported a net profit of 1.5 billion Swiss francs in the first quarter of the year. After the latest earnings, the banking group's CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC that he doesn't expect any sharp slow down for the rest of the year. “I am pleased first of all that we had two consecutive quarters where we reached a return on tangible equity above 15 percent,"" Ermotti told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. ""I still stay confident that, like in the last few years, we have been able to mitigate challenging market conditions and deliver good returns to our shareholders. I do believe we will continue to have a solid performance also for the rest of the year,"" Ermotti added. Back in April, the Swiss bank had cautioned investors that the second quarter could prove difficult. At the time, Ermotti warned that geopolitical tensions and the rise of protectionism posed threats to investor confidence, which could ultimately dent the bank’s performance. Such concerns were repeated on Tuesday. UBS said ""tough ongoing geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism have dampened investor confidence and remain a threat."" The Swiss lender added that muted market volatility has not been very supportive of client activity. Nonetheless, UBS has managed to meet its share repurchase target for this year. The bank bought back 550 million Swiss francs ($553.45 million) worth of own shares under its three-year goal to buy back up to 2 billion Swiss francs of its shares. Speaking to CNBC, Ermotti kept the door open to further repurchases this year if good opportunities come up, despite the bank already meeting its target. UBS shares were up by nearly 4 percent following the results.  The positioning of U.S. clients has shown relative confidence on the macro-economic side, but it has also shown some caution on equity investments, with investors holding more and more cash. Ermotti told CNBC that U.S. clients ""are still quite constructive in respect of the macro-economic outlook but if you look at their equity portfolio they are quite sticky, they don’t really move around their positions and that’s also explained why transaction volumes are down; and also very important compared to the second part of 2017 their cash balances went up to 5 percent … It it is very high.” Generally, investors hold on to cash if they are concerned about the future. One ongoing concern is the flattening of the yield curve — a line that plots short and long-term interest rates, and whether it will invert shortly. An inverted yield has historically preceded recessions, thus many investors track the performance of the curve to predict where the economy will go in the coming months. Ermotti told CNBC that an inverted yield curve “in general it’s not going to be good for banks."" ""But most importantly, from an historical point of view at least it would be one other leading indicator of recessions or economic troubles ahead and therefore it will play out almost inevitable into market adjustments.”",2018-07-24,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/ubs-earnings-q2-2018.html?&qsearchterm="

However, the bank noted there would also be second-order effects. These ""would be larger, with U.S. multinationals doing business in China also likely to be hurt by China retaliation."" Thus, in terms of company valuations, these would take an additional 9.1 percent hit, bringing a total downside of 21.3 percent for the U.S. benchmark after some further adjustments by UBS analysts. So far this year, President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on Chinese solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum, as well as on other imported goods for intellectual property theft. China has retaliated every time. However, there are more potential tariffs on the way, with Trump threatening to impose new levies worth as much as $200 billion. David Riley, the chief investment strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" Friday: ""If I was sitting in Beijing, I would be pretty worried."" ""I think we are going to get potentially more tariffs imposed on China coming at the end of the month, or early September,"" he said. UBS analysts warned Friday that equity investors are not preparing for a trade war scenario, mainly due to recent statements from U.S. and European leaders. On Wednesday, Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker struck a conciliatory tone that put an end to fears of imminent tariffs on European cars. European stocks rallied on the news. However, the agreement didn't eliminate the prospects of new tariffs at a later stage.

UBS Group's Global Real Estate Bubble Index puts Munich, Toronto, Vancouver, London and Amsterdam alongside Hong Kong as cities currently in property bubble territory. ""Major imbalances"" are also found in Stockholm, Paris, San Francisco, Frankfurt and Sydney, the report said. Los Angeles, Zurich, Tokyo, Geneva and New York are merely deemed overvalued, while Chicago is the only city included in the list that is viewed as undervalued. The UBS researchers found a widespread breadth of the rise in property prices in major cities with prices increasing 35 percent on average over the last five years. They identified price bubbles as regularly recurring phenomenon in property, defining them as ""a substantial and sustained mispricing of an asset."" The report said typical signs include a decoupling of prices from local incomes and rents, as well as excessive construction or bank lending. ""Although many financial centers remain at risk of a housing bubble, we should not compare today's situation with pre-crisis conditions,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a statement. Hong Kong is identified as the most extreme city in bubble territory. It has seen house prices rise at an annual rate of almost 10 percent since 2012. Current property cooling measures have failed to rein in prices in the former British colony and there has been some suggestion that tighter restrictions could be coming for non-local homebuyers. Both Toronto and Vancouver are considered by UBS to be in bubble territory. The bank noted that higher stamp duties on foreign buyers have done little to curb the boom in prices in Vancouver but do look to have checked real estate appetite in Toronto. For U.S cities, the UBS bubble risk scores sit below 2006 peak values. Boston and Chicago valuations remained low in fair-valued and undervalued territory respectively, while New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco all fell within the overvalued segment. The score for New York dropped following static sale prices over the last year. In Europe, London's index score declined for the second year in a row. Strained affordability, political uncertainty thanks to Brexit and increased taxes for overseas buyers and buy to-let investors have brought the U.K. capital's housing market to a standstill.

""I think that we are facing macro and geopolitical challenges that we all know, but in addition to that the first-quarter was lacking any of the elements of positive seasonality this year,"" Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Wednesday. Ermotti said that while the first quarter in 2018 had been ""exceptional"" for both the industry as a whole and even more so for UBS, which he said had ""a very outstanding quarter"" - UBS reported a 19 percent jump in net profit in the first quarter of 2018, boosted by its investment banking division - the lender's investment banking division revenues were down by around a third in the first quarter this year. Investment banking is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities. ""The IB (investment banking unit) for us, last year, had an outstanding quarter so on a relative performance point of view most likely we will give away a little bit away of that extra performance, but in this environment, it's true that equity markets have recovered but the conviction level of both institutional and private clients is not there,"" he said. ""The Chinese market is up 25 percent and Hong Kong is up, U.S. is up ,but the volumes supporting that rally are not there,"" Ermotti added. Stocks have been on a tear since the Fed's last meeting in late January. In that time, the S&P 500 has risen more than 5 percent. The broad index is also up more than 12 percent for 2019 in part because investors expect less policy tightening for the year. The rally could extend further as several investors are still on the sidelines. A survey put together by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found the allocation of global stocks among respondents was the lowest since October 2016. Given the market's gains this year, investors underweight stocks could be enticed to increase their equity exposure, thus lifting prices even higher. At the forefront of investors' minds is the rates strategy of the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. The central bank had been expected to push ahead with monetary tightening this year but has faced pressure from President Donald Trump to not keep on hiking rates which he said would damage the U.S. economy. The Fed surprised many onlookers on Wednesday by holding rates steady and signalling that no more hikes would be coming this year, just three months after indicating that there could be two rate increases in 2019. There were four increases in 2018. They also pointed to at least another one before ending a round of policy tightening that began in December 2015. Ermotti told CNBC that the change of course was a potential headwind. ""It presents a headwind vis-a-vis our expectations for the year. We finished the year with an expectation that the Fed would hike a few times during the year now it's quite clear that they're going to pause ... the ECB has also reversed its stance. So I think what is more important is not a headwind vis-a-vis last year but most importantly, vis-a-vis plans and the expectations.""

""I worry a little bit that the market is too optimistic about how much and how soon the Fed will move."" Weber also said he doesn't see the Fed taking any precautionary rate cuts ""at this point."" But Weber, who is also chairman of the IIF, said it is clear the Fed stands ready to respond if it deems such action necessary. ""The fact that the U.S. has some room to maneuver, I think it would be unwise to assume that they will not use that room to maneuver if the economy substantially weakens. However, I think the current pricing in markets is overdone."" Waldron, appearing on the same panel as Weber, added that ""the market is certainly pricing in more than a hundred basis points in cuts now,"" citing options markets. But he projected that the Fed will ""be more reliant on the data than they will on the short-term sentiment."" Weber also suggested that there is some room for optimism if trade conflicts don't worsen. ""Should these tariffs not escalate, there is a lot of room for complete repricing in the markets and some upside related to that,"" he said. —CNBC's Yen Nee Lee contributed to this report.",2019-06-06,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/06/goldman-sachs-and-ubs-execs-markets-are-overpricing-fed-rate-cuts.html?&qsearchterm="

While escalation isn't what UBS expects, a failed meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping that results in a new wave of tariffs would mean ""major"" changes to global GDP and market forecasts, global head of economic research Arend Kapteyn wrote in a note. If the trade war escalates, ""we estimate global growth would be 75bp lower over the subsequent six quarters and that the contours would resemble a mild 'global recession' —similar in magnitude to the Eurozone crisis, the oil collapse in the mid-1980s and the 'Tequila' crisis of the 1990s,"" he wrote. The impact of a scuttled trade deal at the U.S.-China meeting in Osaka and agitated relations wouldn't be felt immediately, however, but grow in severity over several quarters as higher prices stifle demand and growth, the UBS researcher wrote.

Source: UBS U.S. and Chinese negotiators are expected to begin discussions in Osaka this week before Trump and Xi meet, hoping to quell inflamed relations between Washington and Beijing, which have crumbled since late April. In a surprise move, Trump tweeted on May 5 that tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% and that another 25% tariff would ""shortly"" be imposed on an additional $325 billion of imported goods from China. Traders blamed the worsened trade outlook for an equity pullback in May, with the S&P 500 down 6.5% last month. But further aggravation of the trade conflict could push global equities down 20%, Kapteyn said, with the prior U.S. outperformance relative to Europe eroding and emerging markets taking a heavy hit. ""In global sectors, Materials stands out as most vulnerable, but some defensive and crowded segments are also at risk amidst weaker growth,"" he added. ""For a bottom up perspective, we lean on our prior work to highlight trade and crowded growth exposed stocks.""  Source: U.N. Comtrade database, U.S. Department of Commerce, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The economist added that all major central banks would be forced to ease monetary policy, with the U.S. Federal Reserve compelled to cut interest rates by 100 basis points on top of an expected 50-basis-point cut in July. Such a push would pressure the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below its record low of 1.3%, the UBS economist predicted. In China, the government would add another 150 basis points of total social financing growth, with GDP falling under 6%.

"A $10 trillion debt burden coming due one day could hit the stock market and Amazon, UBS proposes","UBS strategist Francois Trahan points out U.S. corporate debt has surged by 50% over the past decade and now stands near $10 trillion. Such a jump in corporate debt would be more worrisome had it not been for the steep drop in yields, he says.But these concerns could be front and center in 2020 as slowing economic activity and a potential fall in corporate earnings could lead to debt downgrades for companies such as Amazon, 3M and Walmart. ","This decade's surge in corporate debt could pressure stocks in 2020 as corporate earnings slow to a crawl, hurting the ability of companies to timely repay that debt and keep the solid credit ratings that allow them to borrow so cheaply, according to a theory laid out by UBS strategist Francois Trahan. Many Wall Street strategists share the concern about the ballooning corporate debt load but few sound as worried as Trahan. Most put it as a footnote in their 2020 outlook reports. The issue is, as Trahan points out, is that credit issues usually don't matter to the equity market unless the economy is in a slowing or contracting phase. In a Tuesday note, Trahan said that U.S. corporate debt has surged by 50% since 2009 and now stands at nearly $10 trillion. Such a jump in corporate debt would be more worrisome had it not been for the steady economic recovery and steep drop in yields, he said. Since 2010, yields on Baa-rated corporate bonds have fallen to around 3.9% from more than 6.3%. However, the impact could be felt as early as next year as slowing economic activity and a potential fall in corporate earnings lead to debt downgrades for some of the biggest companies in the world, including Amazon, 3M and Walmart. Debt downgrades could mean these companies would have to roll over their debt — half of which matures in the next five-to-six years — at a much higher rate, putting pressure on their shares and the broader stock market, he proposes. ""Leaving aside our biases for markets and the economy, LEIs of credit markets point to a deterioration of ratings throughout 2020,"" Trahan said. Trahan pointed to the Institute for Supply Management's new orders index as a key leading indicator, noting it has been in a downtrend for about six months. He also noted the index has been below 50 over the past four months. A reading below 50 signals contraction. This decline in new orders could foreshadow a drop in the S&P 500's average credit rating, which has risen on a year-over-year basis. Trahan notes that measure of economic activity leads the stock benchmark's average credit rating by six months. ""Moreover, interest rates argue that this decline in the ISM is not likely over, suggesting that this risk could possibly last throughout all of 2020,"" the strategist said. Rates fell throughout 2019 as the Federal Reserve pivoted away from the hiking cycle it set off during the previous year. The central bank cut the U.S. overnight rate three times this year after four rate hikes in 2018. All of this takes place at a time when earnings expectations are just above flat. However, if those expectations decline and turn negative, it could amplify debt downgrades for S&P 500 companies and in turn, hit their stock prices, he proposes. Trahan noted Amazon, 3M and Walmart are among the S&P 500 companies that are at risk of receiving a debt downgrade in 2020. The strategist made this determination using a model that accounts for company size, short and long-term capital turnover, profit margins and long-term liquidity. Based on that model, Amazon is at risk of seeing its S&P credit rating to BB, the highest junk-bond grade from AA. Meanwhile, 3M could see its credit rating fall from AA to BBB along with Walmart. Trahan has an S&P 500 target of 3,000 for 2020, which is tied for the lowest one with Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson. That represents a 6% drop from Tuesday's close of 3,192.52. To be sure, Trahan expected the broad index to end 2019 at 2,500, which is more than 21% below current levels.

Shares of the Beaverton, Oregon-based company hit $101.40 intraday Friday, boosted by quarterly earnings and sales released after the bell Thursday that beat analysts' expectations. It closed Friday down 1.1% at $99.96 but is up around 34% year to date. ""Even though it's a $41 billion company, it's only 9% global market share in footwear and just 1% in global market share apparel,"" Sole said on ""The Exchange."" ""There's lots of room to go."" Sole raised his price target Friday on Nike to $103, up from $97. He maintains a hold rating on the stock, citing the widespread bullish outlook on Wall Street. That attitude has helped propel the stock from the low $50s in the fall of 2017 to its current levels around $100. While sales and revenue have grown in the mid-single digits in that period, Sole said the stock nearly doubling reflects a belief that Nike still has brighter days ahead. ""I think the market is anticipating really strong double-digit growth, 15%, even higher, in terms of [earnings per share] over the next few years,"" he said. When asked if that was feasible, Sole responded, ""As big as Nike is, we do think it's possible."" In its quarterly report, Nike's revenue grew by about 10% to $10.33 billion from $9.37 billion a year ago, beating expectations for $10.09 billion. Its North American revenues did fall short of expectations, however, climbing 5.3% during the period to reach $3.98 billion. Analysts had anticipated sales of $4 billion. Nike saw strength in its Jordan brand, which reached quarterly sales of $1 billion for the first time ever. Nike's strong stock performance comes against the backdrop of a shakeup within the company. In October, it abruptly announced that CEO Mark Parker will step down in January. It also has dealt with allegations in November of abuse toward women at Nike's Oregon Project under track coach Alberto Salazar. The team was previously considered to be the best in the world.

"Europe can lead the world in green finance, UBS chairman says","Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, UBS Chairman Axel Weber said that while Europe  struggles to catch up to the size of U.S. capital markets, U.S. companies and federal policy trails the continent in sustainability.","Europe has the chance to lead the world in developing capital markets for green finance, according to UBS Chairman Axel Weber. Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Weber said that while Europe will struggle to catch up to the size of U.S. capital markets, one area where U.S. companies and federal policy trails the continent is in sustainability. ""If you are asking me, as capital markets for green finance develop, where will the nucleus of those markets be? It will be in Europe,"" Weber told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore and Steve Sedgwick. Asked whether the European Commission was to blame for European companies' failure to maintain pace with transatlantic counterparts, Weber suggested that banks and market players had failed to gain the ""dynamics and size of global capital markets that the U.S. has,"" adding that Europe will soon be surpassed by China on capital also. ""Europe has for too long been a bank-based system, and banks have been holding on to that position and haven't really been a gatekeeper to create capital markets,"" Weber said. ""That's the story of success for the U.S. banks; they are the gatekeeper to a deep and liquid capital market, and they have credit business, so they have two pillars of earnings whilst we in Europe largely rely on one."" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney recently said that the financial sector had begun to curb its investment in fossil fuels and shift its priorities toward sustainable investing, but at far too slow a pace. Weber agreed, adding that companies are left with ""two journeys"" at this stage. ""There is a glide path, where you get more and more into green finance, or there is a cliff edge.

"Investors pulled nearly $100 billion from hedge funds in 2019, but UBS insists popularity isn't waning","Data from U.S. research platform eVestment revealed that outflows in December alone hit $16 billion.UBS analysts attributed the flow trends not to the popularity of hedge funds waning, but rather to investors' more advanced understanding of how certain strategies can deliver their desired risk and return profile.","Investors withdrew a net $98 billion from hedge funds in 2019, the largest outflows in three years, but UBS analysts have argued that this does not indicate waning popularity. Data from U.S. research platform eVestment revealed that outflows in December alone hit $16 billion, while Bloomberg reported that investors last year directed 25% of their alternative investments, those outside of traditional areas such as cash, bonds and stocks, into private equity, up from 18% in 2018. However, in a note Monday, UBS Global Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele suggested that outflows from hedge funds only tell half of the story, as total assets under management are actually rising. ""While some investors may have reduced allocations to the asset class overall, hedge fund assets continued to rise amid strong returns, hitting a record high at $3.3 trillion according to the Hedge Fund Research database (HFR),"" he said, adding that hedge funds in 2019 returned on average 10.4%, their best year for a decade. Haefele suggested that while the industry is seeing redemptions, ""top-tier"" managers are continuing to attract capital, or at least suffer fewer redemptions, with only $8 billion outflows registered in total across managers with AUM over $5 billion compared to $32 billion for managers of between $1 billion and $5 billion AUM. ""Redemptions are largely concentrated in just a few strategies, in particular fundamental value equity hedge managers and multi-strategy macro funds,"" Haefele said. ""This is potentially a reflection of investors' emphasis on more specialized strategies and the search for a better diversifier with a multi-asset portfolio."" UBS analysts attributed the flow trends not to the popularity of hedge funds waning, but rather to investors' more advanced understanding of how certain strategies can deliver their desired risk and return profile. Haefele anticipated that top managers will likely continue to manage a larger share of assets while underperformers will continue to suffer greater outflows. ""Within the asset class, we continue to recommend low directional managers. These can include: relative value managers, such as those who exploit various arbitrage opportunities; discretionary macro funds that can, for instance, capture carry and exploit shifts in economic policy; and multi-strategy managers,"" Haefele concluded.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/ubs-nearly-100-billion-pulled-from-hedge-funds-but-popularity-isnt-waning.html?&qsearchterm="

Investors are standing by to withdraw some $7 billion from the UBS Trumbull Property Fund as a growing number move away from more cautious funds, a person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. Hoping to stem the flow, UBS has reportedly offered to cut costs for investors willing to stay in the fund and to forego management fees for new investments, the Journal added citing an analyst presentation to the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Swiss bank's Trumbull fund owns real estate in Cambridge, including the CambridgeSide mall as well as properties across the country in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. UBS did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. An isolated uptick in redemption requests can lead to a host of issues for investment funds like Trumbull if other investors grow nervous the peer withdrawals and, as a result, choose to join the exodus. If real estate fund managers don't have enough cash on hand to meet a small number of redemption requests, they may be forced to initiate the sale of properties. The sale of such illiquid assets can take time and add to investor angst in the meanwhile, placing even more pressure on the manager to sell property. But in contrast to riskier private-equity funds, which dictate when investors are allowed to extract money and include early-exit penalties, the majority of big core funds aren't as strict about how often or how much its clients are allowed to redeem. And while Trumbull isn't the only big-bank property fund seeing outflows, its underperformance versus industry benchmarks has hastened the investor flight. It had performed worse than the NCREIF NFI-ODCE index on a 1-year, 3-year and 5-year basis as of a 2018 presentation to the City of Naples, Florida, Police and Fire Pension Plans. — Read the original Wall Street Journal report here.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/ubs-reportedly-racing-to-curb-outflows-at-landmark-real-estate-fund.html?&qsearchterm="

","The United States steel sector has reached ""the end of the line"" despite efforts by the Trump administration to revive the industry, UBS told clients on Tuesday, advising investors it may be time to ditch the metal stocks. U.S. steel prices should decline 17 percent through the end of 2019, UBS analysts predict, even after tariffs announced earlier this year by President Donald Trump are imposed on some foreign producers . ""Section 232 in the U.S. resulted in lower imports and limited supply, creating volatility, but we expect the market to return to equilibrium,"" analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser wrote. ""Even if imports fall (e.g., because of quotas), we caution that end-demand (manufacturing) will likely trend down driven by higher prices."" ""We closely track China as a primary leading indicator of U.S. steel prices (by one month), and conclude that risk to prices and the domestic spread is to the downside,"" he added. tweet Assuming the predicted fall in prices and a ""structural decline"" in U.S. steel demand, Bokkenheuser initiated coverage of AK Steel and US Steel with sell ratings. His $30 price target on US Steel and $3.25 target on AK Steel represent 17 percent downside and 31 percent downside, respectively, over the next 12 months. Shares of AK Steel, which are down more than 14 percent since January, rose 2.3 percent Wednesday following the UBS note. US Steel's stock, up more than 6.5 percent this year, closed up 3.1 percent Wednesday.  China's voracious demand for and production of steel puts Beijing ""in the driver's seat"" when it comes to global pricing power, UBS said. The country accounted for half of global production in 2017 versus 5 percent in the U.S.; China's steel exports alone are equivalent to the total of U.S. demand as well as half of the global seaborne market. ""Credit support is slowing in China putting downward pressure on construction growth and upward pressure on steel exports,"" he added.

"UBS thinks the Bank of England could hike rates again in May – on one condition","The Bank of England (BoE) could increase interest rates far sooner than expected, according to UBS.The U.K. central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) ""is expected to raise rates in May, if a transitional deal has been struck,"" UBS strategist John Wraith sai","The Bank of England (BoE) could increase interest rates as early as May,  according to UBS, far sooner than expected by most analysts.  But this will happen only if the U.K. government is able to strike a deal with the European Union over a transition period after it leaves the bloc in March 2019, UBS said. The U.K. central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) ""is expected to raise rates in May, if a transitional deal has been struck,"" UBS strategist John Wraith said in a note published Wednesday. UBS has changed its forecast for the next rate hike, now predicting a 25 basis point hike in May that would take the rate to 0.75 percent. However, the bank's global research unit made its prediction ""explicitly conditional on a transitional deal being agreed by March."" The BoE made its first interest rate rise in a decade in November, but has signaled that there would be ""very gradual"" further increases over the next three years and these would be tied over progress in Brexit negotiations. Most analysts had thought the next rate rise would come later in 2018 and in November at the earliest, making the UBS note stand out for its May forecast. UBS said the rates rise could come in May amid a strengthening U.K. economy. ""While we still expect the Brexit process to generate strengthening headwinds for the U.K. economy for a considerable time, the stronger-than-expected outturn for fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) and the better momentum the economy starts 2018 with as a result could give the MPC a window of opportunity to raise bank rate by the middle of the year,"" Wraith wrote. ""However, there are growing doubts about whether the U.K. and EU will agree on a transitional deal by the time of the EU Council Summit in late March, and failure to do so would in our opinion stay the MPC's hand as uncertainty intensifies and the economy slows more materially."" UBS revised its forecasts for U.K. GDP following stronger further quarter growth, seeing growth at 1.4 percent in 2018 and 1.2 percent in 2019 — up from a previous forecast of 1.1 percent for both 2018 and 2019. ""We still expect the pace of growth to slow over the course of 2018, whether a transitional deal is agreed early or not. We believe a near-term resolution would not address the difficulties of arriving at longer term arrangements that are economically favorable to the U.K, nor will it diminish the acute domestic political risks that both increase the complexities of the Brexit negotiations and are likely to keep investment activity subdued."" There are signs that even a slight rate rise is putting off potential homebuyers, with the BoE saying earlier this week that the number of mortgages approved for house purchase in December fell to 61,039 in January, the lowest level since January 2015, following the bank's interest rate rise.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/01/ubs-says-bank-of-england-could-hike-rates-in-may.html?&qsearchterm="
"The ultra-rich want to make money through good causes — but there aren't enough options, UBS says","Along with financial returns, the super wealthy also want their investments to drive positive changes in the world, said Simon Smiles, chief investment officer for ultra-high net worth at UBS Wealth Management.But the opportunity to do that is lacking, Smiles told CNBC.That's because many sustainable investment products simply leave out financially risky companies or firms in the business of ""vices,"" he explained.","The super wealthy want more out of their investments these days. In addition to financial returns, they want their money to drive positive changes in the world, but the options for achieving both concurrently is lacking, according to a UBS expert. The Swiss bank, the largest wealth manager globally, was referring to a money-making discipline known as sustainable investing. That's an umbrella term for investing in financial instruments that generate returns from doing good — or simply supporting something that's not doing bad. But many of the available investment products marketed as being socially responsible or sustainable simply leave out financially risky companies or firms deemed to be in the business of ""vices"" — a method that doesn't resonate with all investors, said Simon Smiles, chief investment officer for ultra-high net worth at UBS Wealth Management. ""It may turn out that you don't want to invest in tobacco, firearms and alcohol, and so you don't do that. But to assume that everyone has that same value is inherently problematic,"" Smiles told CNBC in March. ""Some people like drinking alcohol, some people like smoking, some people like guns, so to tell investors they shouldn't be doing it because it's wrong, you're straightaway not aligning with their values. (But) that's the way a vast majority of sustainable investing products have been positioned,"" he explained. Instead of avoiding ""bad"" companies and investing only in firms with good credit ratings, super wealthy individuals want their portfolios to reflect what they believe in, said Smiles. That means building a whole portfolio with investments that best represent their views on the world, he added. For example, investors who want a part in driving global development could choose bonds issued by institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and those passionate about green efforts could invest in debt instruments that use proceeds to finance activities benefiting the environment. ""A vast proportion of opportunities across the industry focus on specific equities, specific funds, specific ETFs rather than thinking of it in a portfolio context,"" the CIO said, explaining that clients aren't interested in strategies that exclude kinds of products from a portfolio or pick out single equities in a ""piecemeal"" fashion. ""Instead, the conversation's more about: How do you ingrain sustainability in a coherent way across the entire portfolio?"" he added. The mismatch between what's available in the market and what super-rich individuals want is one reason why sustainable investment makes up a ""still small"" proportion in their portfolios, said Smiles. That's despite the overall growth seen in sustainable investment. The latest biennial report by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance published last year found that globally, the strategy grew 25 percent between 2014 and 2016 to $22.89 trillion. That's around 26.3 percent of total assets under management. At the same time, the super-wealthy are still holding onto large amounts of cash — a situation that hasn't changed much since the last global financial crisis, the CIO noted. A UBS survey last year found ultra-high net worth investors — those with at least $30 million in investible assets —  allocate as much as 35 percent of their portfolios to cash. He added that UBS has been advising clients to invest some of that cash, especially now that the environment is still favorable for ""risk assets"" such as stocks. ""But clients still, on average, hold more cash than what we'd recommend from an investment perspective,"" Smiles said. ""The memory of (global financial crisis) is still fresh enough for people to value significant cash balances more.""",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/15/ubs-ultra-high-net-worth-investors-find-sustainable-investment-opportunities-lacking.html?&qsearchterm="

"UBS plans to shift some staff to Frankfurt after Brexit: Memo","UBS tells staff majority of moves will be to Frankfurt: memoBank to merge its British entity with German hub: annual reportPlans assume no transitional deal is reached","Swiss bank UBS has told employees that the majority of those affected by Brexit will move to Frankfurt from London, setting out what it called a decentralised approach to relocating staff.  The moves are expected to affect fewer than 200 UBS staff, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. UBS employs around 5,000 people in London.  Staff affected will be informed in the next few months and relocations will depend on where clients are based, according to a company memo seen by Reuters.  Separately, the Swiss bank said in its annual report on Friday that it will merge UBS Limited, its British entity, into UBS Europe SE, its German headquartered European bank, in the absence of a transition deal between Britain and the EU. That would take place prior to Britain leaving the European Union on 29 March, 2019. ""After a thorough analysis, which included your feedback, we have opted for a more decentralized model and plan to leverage our existing UBS Europe SE and its extensive branch network,"" UBS's investment banking chief Andrea Orcel said in the memo. The plans announced by UBS are the latest sign of how banks are starting to execute on Brexit contingency plans after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.  The loss of these passporting rights - which currently enable finance firms to freely offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via just one local license - is a major concern for banks.

"UBS shares slide as bank issues cautious outlook despite earnings beat","The Swiss bank announced a net profit of 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($1.54 billion) for the first three months of the year, slightly above analysts' expectations.Equity trading revenue rose 17 percent in the first quarter, boosted by market volatility.","UBS shares dropped about 4 percent on Monday morning despite reporting a 19 percent jump in net profit in the first quarter of the year. The bank showed a somewhat cautious outlook going forward and some analysts were unhappy with the performance of certain divisions. UBS warned that the second quarter of 2018 could include higher funding costs related to long-term debt and regulatory operations compared to the same period in 2017. It also cited geopolitical tensions and the rise of protectionism as threats to investor confidence. Speaking to CNBC, UBS Group CEO Sergio Ermotti said the bank's outlook is ""balanced"" and it has a ""realistic view of the world."" He also said that UBS has proved that it is able to deliver good results in different market environments. The move in the share price was also caused by a slow performance, if investment banking is excluded. Gildas Surry, senior analyst at Axiom Alternative Investments, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that ""if you remove the performance of equities and investment banking, is actually a miss."" ""Wealth management in fact has been a bit slow... and also if you look at another headwind, which is regulations, they have front-loaded the cost of regulation... which is a bit of a hurdle for them in this quarter,"" Surry added. The Swiss bank announced a net profit of 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($1.54 billion) for the first three months of the year, slightly above analysts' expectations of 1.419 billion Swiss francs, and better than last year's 1.27 billion Swiss francs. Here are the key highlights: Looking at the bank's investment banking division, equity trading revenues rose 17 percent in the first quarter and corporate client solutions revenues grew 15 percent. The market volatility seen since the start of the year has supported investment banking. On the other hand, fixed income, rates and credit revenues dropped 11 percent compared to a year ago.  Sergio Ermotti, the UBS Group chief executive officer, told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore that he is ""very pleased with the way the year has started."" When asked if he was concerned about market conditions shifting and affecting the performance of investment banking going into the second quarter, he said: ""I still expect more of the same for 2018 that we saw in 2016 and 2017."" ""I do think that the second quarter, of course we are going to have some seasonality factor, but you know I really don't see things having changed a lot,"" Ermotti said. The Swiss bank also warned during its earnings report that the second quarter of 2018 could include higher funding costs related to long-term debt and regulatory operations compared to the same period in 2017. Speaking to CNBC, Ermotti also said that as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield — a benchmark for global debt — gets closer to the 3 percent threshold, ""there's an absolute but also a psychological element that will kick in."" ""People will assess their asset allocations and potentially look at bonds,"" he noted. The 10-year yield reached 2.96 percent Friday, hitting its highest level since January 10, 2014. Some market players are wary of the move between long and short-term rates as it can indicate how the economy might perform in coming years. The flattening of the yield curve, (every time the short-term yield comes closer to the longer-term yield) could be a problem for banks. ""Of course this is not really good for banking, for banks in general and particularly for banks that have a meaningful part of their balance sheet in Swiss francs and euros,"" Ermotti said.",2018-04-23,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/ubs-q1-2018-earnings.html?&qsearchterm="

This time round in Russia, Swiss lender UBS has thrown its hat into the ring by using econometric tools — more traditionally applied to assess investment opportunities — to predict who will lift the trophy in Moscow on July 15. Perhaps unsurprisingly, simulations indicate no country has higher odds of winning the tournament than current champions Germany, leading the table with a likelihood of 24 percent. By its own admission UBS's system is not perfect, but the bank is confident that it has identified enough key variables have been identified to support the claims that also install Brazil and Spain as the most likely to challenge the Germans. ""No matter whether they are analyzing global markets or soccer tournaments, people tend to be biased towards local favorites. The same quantitative discipline that the chief investment office applies to investments has proven useful in successfully looking beyond a home bias in portfolios and sports events,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a research note Thursday. Perennial underachiever England could be a surprising sight to some to be as high as fourth on the list, especially as it limped out in the group stage at the last World Cup four years ago. England Manager Gareth Southgate named his 23-man squad for this tournament on Wednesday, with a clear emphasis on youth, with an average age of 26 years and 18 days. With a favorable draw, potentially avoiding the likes of Germany, Brazil and Spain in the second round, it's predicted the team could be in line for their best World Cup performance since 1990, with an 18.7 percent chance of finishing as runners up. Despite being the lowest ranked team in the tournament, the report also suggests host country Russia should still be optimistic about its chances. Six out of the previous 20 champions lifted the trophy on home soil, while two more hosts made it to the finals, and five more to the semis. Those expecting Russia to go all the way and claim an improbable win though, look set to be disappointed, with the formula suggesting it has a 2 percent chance of being the overall winner. Using the system, each World Cup group has been rated in terms of its perceived difficulty to qualify from, with Russia's Group A, containing Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay emerging as by far the weakest. According to the same formula though, Group H containing Colombia, Japan, Poland, and Senegal is hardest to predict, as teams are all ranked fairly close. Although the model predicts Colombia should take top spot, followed by Poland. As for the chances of Argentina and Portugal, even UBS's report states much of their fate will come down to the performances of their respective key men Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The data predicts the chances of both their sides diminish beyond the quarter-finals, as the world's two best players begin what could be their last shots at a World Cup winner's medal.",2018-05-18,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/world-cup-winner-predicted-by-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="

Analysts from UBS's Global Automobiles practice estimate that Tesla will incur an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) loss of $2,800 per Model 3 sold at its base price of $35,000 but the company will break even if it can achieve an average sale price of $41,000 — a level UBS thinks will most likely be exceeded. The UBS analysts developed their estimates after tearing down a new Chevrolet Bolt — a car that they say shares many similarities with Tesla's upcoming Model 3.   Many skeptics have said Tesla may not be able to make money on the Model 3, which is priced steeply lower than the company's high-end cars but still makes use of much of the same technology and materials. Unfortunately for Chevrolet, UBS estimated that GM loses $7,400 (EBIT) on every Bolt sold today, mainly due to the lack of scale.  That loss comes even after the group found that the Bolt's electric powertrain is $4,600 cheaper to produce than UBS had previously thought. Still, UBS says GM and all electric-vehicle makers have the potential to reduce costs further. This means the total cost of owning an electric vehicle can match that of an internal combustion engine car much sooner than UBS had previously estimated, creating an ""inflection point for demand."" Therefore the group is raising its expectations for global electric-vehicle sales in 2025 by about 50 percent to 14.2 million, or about 14 percent of global car sales. Currently, worldwide sales of electric vehicles are around 0.7 percent of all new cars sold, according to research firm IHS Markit.  The things that could prevent this demand from growing include low or no political support for electrification, low gas prices, or a lack of understanding over the total cost of ownership among cars.

""We are now in a position to continue and implement our attractive capital return policy, we increased our ordinary dividend and announcing (a) share buyback program,"" Ermotti told CNBC. Net profit included a writedown of 2.865 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter of deferred tax assets due to the introduction a new tax cuts and the jobs act in the United States.

UBS also said on Monday that it would increase its dividend for investors to 0.65 Swiss francs per share — an 8 percent jump from last year. The bank also introduced a three-year share buyback program of up to 2 billion Swiss francs.

""We have to pay attention to what we are wishing for here, if volatility is triggered by sudden changes in the macroeconomic environment, which we don't expect, more particularly geopolitical events, that wouldn't be a welcomed volatility for sure,"" he said.

"UBS, Deutsche Bank and HSBC to pay millions in spoofing settlement, CFTC says","Deutsche Bank will pay $30 million, UBS $15 million and HSBC $1.6 million to settle civil charges that some of their traders engaged in spoofing in the precious metals market.The CFTC charged six individuals, and the Department of Justice charged eight with crimes related to deceptive trading in a wide-ranging investigation.","Until now, an illegal trading technique called ""spoofing"" has been associated with two-bit commodities outfits and lone wolf traders operating in the shadows of the markets. But prosecutors revealed on Monday that their investigations have hit the big time. Deutsche Bank, UBS and HSBC will collectively pay nearly $47 million to settle civil regulatory charges that some of their traders engaged in spoofing in precious metals. Deutsche Bank will pay $30 million and UBS $15 million of that total in a wide-reaching investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that also names six individuals. HSBC will pay $1.6 million. All three banks cooperated with the probe. In addition, the Justice Department said Monday it has charged eight individuals with crimes related to deceptive trading, including seven who have been charged with spoofing. Five of these people were employees of global financial institutions, two were traders at large commodities trading firms and one owned a technology consulting firm. Spoofing involves placing buy and sell orders with the intent to cancel them before completing the transactions. The orders create the illusion of demand, which distorts prices in a way that benefits the trader's positions. So-called high-frequency trading, in which traders use computers to rapidly trade in and out of positions, has been a focus of investigators. The traders named individually, ranging in age from 30 to 55, face accusations they manipulated various futures markets, including S&P index and precious metals, by placing hundreds, in some cases thousands, of ""spoof"" orders to induce other market participants to trade at prices, quantities or times they otherwise would not have traded, the Justice Department said. They traded from their workplaces scattered around the world, from Chicago, New York, London, Zurich, Sydney and Singapore. Six of the individuals were named in both the CFTC and criminal charges. Two others were named in a criminal case. ""Spoofing is a particularly pernicious example of bad actors seeking to manipulate the market through the abuse of technology,"" said James McDonald, the CFTC's enforcement director. ""The technological developments that enabled electronic and algorithmic trading have created new opportunities in our markets."" In a separate statement, John Cronan of the criminal division of the Justice Department said, ""Conduct like this pose significant risk of eroding confidence in U.S. markets and creates an uneven playing field for legitimate traders and investors."" A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in a statement, ""The bank has provided substantial and proactive cooperation with the government's investigation and has enhanced controls and surveillance to help ensure that the underlying conduct does not occur in the future."" An HSBC spokesman said, ""We are pleased to have resolved this issue."" A UBS spokesman said,  ""UBS is pleased to have resolved this several-year-old matter. As the CFTC recognizes in the settlement, UBS self-reported this alleged conduct to the CFTC, cooperated fully in the investigation, and has long since remediated the conduct."" High-frequency trading, which gained steam as a strategy more than a decade ago with the popularity of electronic and computer-driven trading, brought with it a modern twist on trading abuses that have long affected financial markets. Though traders in past eras faced similar accusations of price manipulation, high-speed trading made it possible to carry out a scheme on a grander level. Anti-spoofing rules were spelled out in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, designed to clean up Wall Street after the financial crisis. Prosecutors and the CFTC set out to find cases but until now had only named traders working for smaller outfits or for themselves. Michael Coscia, a New Jersey-based trader, was the first person to be tried. He was sentenced to three years in prison in 2016 for spoofing and commodities fraud, and his conviction was upheld on appeal last year. Prosecutors said Coscia made more than $1 million manipulating the prices of gold and other commodity futures using computer-generated trading strategies.",2018-01-31,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/29/ubs-deutsche-bank-and-hsbc-to-pay-millions-in-spoofing-settlement.html?&qsearchterm="
"UBS Chairman Weber: Central banks are keeping cautious faith in policy normalization","UBS chairman tells CNBC that central banks fear that continuing easy monetary policy will build up risks in markets.Axel Weber noted that the Fed is normalizing its policy rate at around half the speed it had in previous years.The former central banker said markets should remember that liquidity will not suddenly end.","The chairman of UBS told CNBC that central banks around the world will stick to the path of policy normalization in a bid to avoid the risk of volatility in markets. Policy normalization is the attempt by central banks to reduce the size of their balance sheet and raise benchmark interest rates so that monetary policy returns to the environment prior to the global financial crisis in 2008. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche in an exclusive interview at the UBS European Conference in London on Wednesday, Axel Weber said that global liquidity, while still increasing would soon start to shrink as central banks stopped buying assets. ""That's going to produce a headwind to global markets, but the central banks are confident enough they can manage the situation and that their monetary policy normalization is the right way to go,"" said Weber. Weber said central banks fear that continued easy monetary policy will build up risks in markets as volatility grows, putting strain on any financial instabilities. The U.S. Federal reserve has led the charge in raising interest rates, leading to some criticism that the world's most influential central bank could choke off economic growth. That concern has been reflected in equity markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 600 points on Monday, and as of Tuesday 65 percent of S&P 500 stocks were considered to be in correction territory. Weber noted that the U.S. Federal Reserve has actually been normalizing its policy rate at half the speed it did over previous cycles and being a buyer of last resort was not a function that any central bank had at the core of its remit. He added that market participants should remember that market liquidity was unlikely to disappear quickly. ""What you will see is that as the Fed has reduced its balance sheet and as the ECB balance sheet has stabilized, they will still reinvest any maturing debt in the future, so it is not as if their balances will shrink."" The UBS chairman said he expected policy normalization would not arrive in a finished form until the next economic cycle. ""Clearly the central banks are in a cautious normalization,"" he said before adding that current evidence of a slowdown in some countries around the world would also give central bankers pause for thought.",NA,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/ubs-chairman-weber-central-banks-want-policy-normalization.html?&qsearchterm="

""I still believe, and the UBS house view also believes, that China (is) still representing the most investment opportunities in the world. Maybe we can conservatively say one of the most opportunities in the world … We still think the next year will see moderate growth in the equity market as well as the GDP (gross domestic product) growth,"" she told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Wednesday. Her comments come as a trade war has escalated between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, and disrupted the markets after the President Donald Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on Sept. 24, and those duties will rise to 25 percent on Jan.1, 2019. Trump has since suggested in a Wall Street Journal interview this week that he could place a 10 percent tariff on iPhones and laptops. He also said during the interview that it is ""highly unlikely"" he will delay an increase in tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on Jan 1. Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are due to meet at the G-20 summit in Argentina this weekend and it's hoped the two will come to an agreement. Cai was asked her opinion on the impact it's having on the markets in China. She said: ""I think every article, people read different views on what is going to happen three days from now ... I think everybody hopes the two leaders will reach some kind of agreement because it will be good for the world economy, particularly very positive for China and the U.S.,"" she said. ""The market has been very fragile and in the past two weeks the whole market both U.S. and China has been further weakening. So the market is waiting for good news and nobody wants to see bad news from these two leaders meeting,"" she added, but said the market wants to see something specific and not just hand shakes between the two leaders. Regarding Chinese assets, Cai added that global equity investors should perhaps be shifting to more stable parts of the economy during this trade turmoil, suggesting that growth stocks and technology could see more volatility. ""A lot of people mention the trade war will bring more damage to the China market but not necessarily. Any war is going to damage both sides,"" she added. ""In past two weeks, the U.S. market has turned very soft, a lot of big tech names have lost their market value in a very significant way. Take for example Apple have lost $200 billion in market valuation. Also, a lot of economic indicators from the U.S. demonstrated the potential softening for the upcoming years ... So I hope the U.S. government also realize the trade war, more or less, is also going to impact the U.S. economy and not only China's economy,"" she added. Cai was also asked about fintech (financial technology) developments in China. It's an area that has been hampered by government policy after crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) were banned in the country in 2017. However, whilst the government is not endorsing crypto, it wants to be a frontrunner in blockchain technology, as CNBC reported from East Tech West Tuesday. ""I think there is a lot of potential for China's fintech industry to develop … There is a lot of things that can be developed, to be done in this sector,"" she said. On what opens the gate to get the ball rolling for fintech, Chi said it's less about valuation and more about regulatory concerns. ""Everyone is waiting for more clarity and transparency on the regulation front in the fintech sector … We hope next year we will have better certainty,"" she added. Cai said her outlook for China in 2019 depends on what happens with the trade agreement between the U.S. and China when Trump and Xi meet at the G-20 summit in Argentina this weekend. ""Regardless, 2018 has been (a) very tough year for the equity markets and the bond markets, and also for China's economy. For 2019, we are expecting, we hope we will be more stabilized on both bond and equity markets. However, that's depending on the trade tension between these two countries.

""I can say to you that we're seeing very little panic, that we're seeing very little evidence of flight,"" John Woods, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""It seems at least both depositors and businesses are not moving money in any meaningful way."" ""There is a lot of talk about perhaps capital flight, but we are not seeing any sign of that,"" added Tan Min Lan, head of the Asia Pacific chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management. The protests over a now-suspended extradition bill which would have allowed China to potentially freeze assets in the city, initially sparked talk that Hong Kong tycoons have started moving their personal wealth offshore. Later, with the deepening unrest, bankers and wealth managers reportedly said that they were receiving more queries from individuals to move their funds to Singapore. But Woods told that the indicators being watched by his team — on funds moving out of Hong Kong — ""are essentially flat."" ""These are indicators which suggest money is actually leaving the Hong Kong territory, or for example, deposits in Hong Kong dollars being unwound,"" he said. ""We're seeing absolutely no sign yet of that behavior."" Hong Kong has been rocked by a protracted period of protests since June, that has evolved into a wider fight for democracy, raising concerns over the outlook for its economy. In August, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam warned that the city's economy faces a risk of downturn amid the unrest. The government announced an economic support package worth $2.544 billion, saying that the 2019 GDP growth is expected to be lower at 0% to 1%, from the original 2-3%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's private sector activity declined at the fastest pace in more than a decade in August, a business survey showed on Wednesday, as an escalating trade war and the local unrest hit all aspects of demand. For decades, the Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the greenback. To ensure stability of its currency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — seen as a de-facto central bank for the city — intervenes in the foreign exchange market. For example, if the Hong Kong dollar weakens too much, it will step in to buy the currency with its foreign exchange reserves. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged in a tight range of around HK$7.75-7.85 per U.S. dollar, but has been weakening this year. But Tan said the peg appears stable amid the unrest. ""The peg is very solid because the currency in circulation is backed 1.7 times by (foreign exchange) reserves,"" she told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Tuesday. ""The (foreign exchange) reserve is huge, we're talking about 435 billion U.S. dollars.""

An escalated trade war between the U.S. and China has deepened fears of a recession, while the so-called yield curve inversion, a bond market phenomenon that's historically predictive of an economic downturn, also intensified the concerns.

But while the environment is currently slow, he said global growth will see a ""significant recovery going into the second half of 2020, particularly in the fourth quarter."" The two sides agreed to a ""phase one"" deal in October, but officials in Beijing say they don't anticipate sitting down to discuss a ""phase two"" deal before the U.S. election, in part because they want to  see if President Donald Trump wins a second term. Trump himself said Tuesday that it might be better to wait until after the 2020 election to strike a trade deal with China. ""We see that the U.S. economy has actually slowed down and we see a relatively good chance that there may be a first phase deal and maybe the December tariffs get pushed out or actually even removed.

The next tariff deadline is Dec. 15 but it is still uncertain whether the two sides will pen an official agreement before that date. If the two sides cannot reach a deal by mid-December, then additional U.S. levies on Chinese exports will go into effect. Since the world's two largest economies started their trade war in early 2018, Asia has seen a downward trend, said Zuercher, but trade was not the only contributing factor to a global slowdown. It was also during that time when central banks ""started to remove some of the stimulus and started (to) actively to shrink balance sheet globally,"" he said.

Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against the president following a series of public hearings detailing the administration's conduct regarding foreign policy in Ukraine. Thus far, markets have shown little reaction to developments in the impeachment inquiry, and this could be down to the unlikelihood that the Republican-controlled Senate will convict. ""The UBS U.S. Office of Public Policy regards impeachment as likely, as it can be passed in the House without any Republican votes, but considers a Senate conviction unlikely, as Republicans hold a majority in that chamber and a two-thirds supermajority would be needed,"" UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele said in a note to investors on Monday. Senate Republicans have rallied behind the president throughout the inquiry, consistently adapting their defenses in response to each piece of evidence presented by senior officials and diplomats in sworn testimonies before the House Intelligence Committee. As a result, UBS does not regard uncertainty around the process as a source of market risk. However, the upcoming election in November 2020 could be pivotal, impacting key equity sectors such as technology, energy and health care, the Swiss lender projected. Trump has previously suggested that tech giants could face scrutiny from antitrust regulators, and a Department of Justice review is underway. There is a polarization of views within the Democratic contenders, with frontrunner Joe Biden urging further investigation before action is taken while Senator Elizabeth Warren has published a plan to break up ""big tech."" The Trump administration has loosened environmental regulations on energy companies, but this trend would almost certainly be reversed under any potential Democratic president. Warren has gone as far as to propose an out-and-out ban on fracking by executive order. On the health care front, Trump has set out to weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which is still favored by the Democratic field, albeit with varying views on the extent to which greater provision of public health care is required. There is also a broad consensus among the hopefuls that a form of restriction on drug pricing is necessary, a position which enjoys some bipartisan support and could hurt the health care and pharmaceutical industries. ""So, while the U.S. is one of our preferred markets, specific sectors could face volatility — or even longer-term headwinds — as the election campaign progresses,"" Haefele added.

"Buy Netflix before earnings because subscriber growth will top Street: UBS","UBS tells its clients Netflix will report third-quarter subscriber growth above expectations later this month.Netflix shares are crushing the market this year, up 45 percent year-to-date through Tuesday.The streaming giant is set to release a ""very strong"" host of new content, including renewals of popular shows including ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" as well as eight new original dramas.","Even though Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks this year, one Wall Street firm continues to recommend the streaming video giant's shares ahead of its earnings report. UBS told its clients the company will report third-quarter subscriber growth above expectations later this month. ""We see upside to third-quarter guidance based on our analysis suggesting subscriber growth momentum has sustained into the third-quarter with broad-based year-over-year improvements across almost all markets,"" wrote UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson. ""Based on the lackluster stock performance this quarter and investor expectations for an in-line quarter, we see near-term upside to shares."" Shares of Netflix jumped 3.5 percent Wednesday after the report. The company is slated to report third-quarter earnings results on October 16, according to its website. The analyst raised his price target on Netflix to $225, which is 26 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price. The old target was $190. UBS also raised its third-quarter estimates on U.S. net additions to 100,000 and international additions to 300,000, pushing total second-half net addition estimates to about 1 million above Wall Street consensus. Since highs in July, Netflix shares have fallen about 4 percent, a dip Mitchelson attributes to a recent lack of compelling original content compared to last year's third quarter. Netflix remains one of the strongest stocks this year, up 45 percent since January. ""We see 3Q17 as a tougher year-over-year comparison as 1) no ""Stranger Things,"" 2) five fewer dramas, and 3) no apparent new smash hits,"" explained the analyst. But looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Netflix may have more reason to celebrate. It is set to release ""very strong"" new content, the analyst said, including renewals of popular shows ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" as well as eight new original dramas. Netflix also revealed a new slate of anime originals and made its first acquisition by buying Millarworld, a comic book publishing company responsible for franchises including ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" and ""Wanted."" The original content is what has ""played a crucial role"" in the company's subscriber growth, he said. Still, investors may be hesitant to acquire more shares of Netflix with fears of competition looming. Many have turned to streaming services by rivals Hulu and Amazon, which announced plans to expand its streaming service into India with Italy, Spain and France potentially next, according to an earlier UBS report.

"CME's plan for bitcoin futures mirrors moment just before the 1637 tulip bubble crash, UBS says","UBS economist Paul Donovan said plans for bitcoin futures contract mirror the situation just before the tulip bubble burst in the 1600sCME Group announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures contracts, pending regulatory approvalThe price of bitcoin soared above $7,000 to hit a new record high","CME Group announced plans for bitcoin futures contracts earlier this week, a move that UBS analyst Paul Donovan has compared to the introduction of a similar product just before the tulip bubble burst in the 1600s. The tulip craze in the Netherlands in the 17th century saw the price of the flower skyrocket. This resulted in a crash of that market in 1637. In 1636, cash-settled futures were introduced in the tulip market. A futures contract is one where a buyer and seller will agree a price for a commodity that will be delivered on a certain date. This previously meant that the physical product had to be delivered. But cash-settled futures contracts allow cash to be delivered upon expiration. This method was used during the tulip bubble and a year later in 1637, the market crashed. The CME Group said earlier this week that it plans to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory review. Those futures will be based on cash settlement too. Donovan, wealth management global chief economist at UBS, said: ""We've been here before."" TWEET In a follow-up email to CNBC, Donovan explained the issues with the cash-settled futures contracts for tulips and how that compares to bitcoin.  ""The idea of not physically delivering the product was rather shocking to contemporaries (as it turns out, the market crashed before bulbs could have been delivered anyway – bulbs were lifted in June 1637 for physical delivery). Traders met in groups (in taverns), called 'Colleges.' Think of the taverns as the cryptocurrency exchanges of their day,"" Donovan said. UBS has been been one of the bearish voices on bitcoin. In a research paper published last month, the investment bank said that bitcoin is a ""speculative bubble"" and will never be a real currency.  Bitcoin has often been compared to the tulip craze. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called the cyrptocurrency a ""fraud"" and said ""it's worse than tulip bulbs"" and ""won't end well."" The cryptocurrency continues to rally. On Thursday, bitcoin smashed through the $7,300 level to hit a new all-time high. ",2019-06-19,"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/02/bitcoin-futures-mirror-1637-tulip-bubble-crash-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="
"Lawmaker calls for House hearing on UBS bonds sold in Puerto Rico, following CNBC investigation","A senior member of the House Financial Services Committee is calling for a congressional hearing following a CNBC investigation.The investigation found that UBS was not forthcoming about the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds sold to residents in Puerto Rico.""The reported claims... are egregious, unethical, and potentially illegal,"" Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.) wrote in a letter Thursday to Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas).","A senior member of the House Financial Services Committee is calling for a congressional hearing, following a CNBC  investigation that found UBS was not forthcoming about the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds sold to residents on the island. Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter on Thursday to Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), the chairman of the committee, urging him to convene a hearing to investigate the marketing and sales practices of investment companies operating in Puerto Rico. ""The reported claims of deception, mismanagement, and coercion highlighted in the CNBC article, if true, are egregious, unethical, and potentially illegal,"" said Velázquez in the letter. ""All Americans deserve honesty, integrity, and trust when it comes to investing in our capital markets -- they are the fundamental truths that our free-enterprise system is based upon."" ""A culture of deception and deceit erodes that trust and could lead investors to lose faith in our institutions and markets,"" she wrote. Read Velázquez's full letter below: CNBC obtained 2,000 pages of documents, which detailed the dialogue among executives at UBS related to the firm's proprietary bond funds, which were majority comprised of Puerto Rico debt. The funds, which were not traded on a public exchange, collapsed four years ago, causing thousands of residents on the island to lose their savings. CNBC's investigation, ""Broken Bonds,"" was published Monday.  Due to a loophole in a 77-year-old piece of U.S. legislation, none of the funds was regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Investment Company Act of 1940 allowed funds offered outside of the mainland — in this case, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico — to avoid restrictions, such as leverage standards and certain affiliated party transactions. Velázquez sponsored a bill that is seeking to close that loophole: The ""U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act of 2017"" was passed in the House earlier this year and is still awaiting a vote in the Senate. She has said that if Puerto Rico had the same regulatory oversight as the mainland had, much of the residents' losses from the bond funds may have been prevented. The legislation would amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to repeal the exemption to ensure that financial institutions that operate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and elsewhere operate under the same rules as their stateside counterparts. When Congress first enacted the Investment Company Act of 1940, it was deemed too expensive for regulators with the SEC to travel to U.S. territories — which then also included Alaska and Hawaii, in addition to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Since then, both Alaska and Hawaii have become states, air travel to and from Puerto Rico has become less expensive, and a large portion of financial activity takes place electronically. Therefore, it would be far easier to patrol financial activities in U.S. territories than it was 77 years ago, Velázquez has argued. This is Velázquez's third attempt at proposing a bill that would close this loophole. Her first effort was in 2015, after she first heard about the substantial losses residents had on the island. That version would have closed the loophole immediately. She tried again in 2016 with an updated version of the bill that included a three-year safe harbor period, with the option for the SEC to grant an additional three-years if warranted. The bill was later approved with bipartisan backing in the House, sending it to the Senate where the bill stalled, unable to get approval before the end of the 114th Congress. ""Lobbyists retained by UBS Puerto Rico have tried relentlessly to gut the bill or block it,"" a Velázquez spokesman said. ""What they call modifications would actually prevent the bill from safeguarding Puerto Rico's most vulnerable investors. One need only follow the money and they can draw their own conclusions."" Velázquez said that an anonymous senator put a hold on the bill at the end of that year. So she reintroduced her bill on March 6 of this year with eight bipartisan co-sponsors, including Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.), and the sole congressional representative for Puerto Rico, Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, a Republican. González-Colón spoke about the bill over the spring on the House floor, saying that ""investors residing in Puerto Rico and other territories have experienced investment losses, some of which likely would have been prohibited had the 1940 Act applied to the territories."" González-Colón notes that UBS was able to serve as an adviser to the Puerto Rico's pension agency, the Employee Retirement System (ERS) and then, in 2008, also led the underwriting of $2.9 billion bond issuances for ERS. UBS Puerto Rico then sold approximately $1.7 billion of those bonds directly into funds managed or co-managed by the firm and sold exclusively to customers on the island. ERS's bonds are currently undergoing bankruptcy-like proceedings. Publicly filed documents reveal substantial lobbying efforts related to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Luis Fortuño, who served as governor of Puerto Rico from 2009 to 2013, was hired as a lobbyist for ""advocacy work in relation to proposed amendments to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related matters,"" lobbying disclosure documents show. Fortuño, who is a partner in Steptoe & Johnson's Washington office, along with his colleagues, have been paid $485,000 for lobbying services related to the Investment Company Act of 1940 since being hired in July 2016, according to quarterly disclosure statements. Lopez Sanchez & Pirillo LLC, a San Juan-based law firm, is listed as the client who hired Steptoe & Johnson in 2016 and 2017. That same firm has previously represented UBS Puerto Rico in a 2016 lawsuit, a court filing shows. José Sánchez-Castro, a co-founding member of Lopez Sanchez & Pirillo, has represented UBS Financial Services, UBS Puerto Rico Family of Funds, and the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico under the ""representative cases/matters"" portion of his bio page on his firm's website. Neither Sánchez-Castro nor a representative for UBS responded to multiple requests for comment. ""Our client is a group of Funds. UBS Puerto Rico-sponsored funds are members of that group ,"" Kathy King, a spokesperson for Steptoe & Johnson, said in a statement to CNBC. ""Steptoe represents a group of mutual funds that represent more than 95 percent of the mutual funds of Puerto Rico. These funds all have local independent boards of directors with a fiduciary duty to their specific fund's Puerto Rican shareholders."" ""We support the bill and want to protect Puerto Rico investors, but the potential consequences of approving the bill without an amendment to the safe harbor provisions could further harm the local Puerto Rican investors that the bill purports to protect,"" Steptoe & Johnson's King said in the statement. ""We have consistently offered to work with Rep. [Velázquez's] staff to assist in the approval of the bill in a way that will not harm the local investors in hopes to protect."" Fortuño also has his own ties to UBS. The firm is listed as Fortuño's third biggest contributor to his campaign to be governor in 2008, according to election-contributions database, OpenSecrets.org. The site notes that for the contributor category, the organizations themselves have not donated, rather the money calculated in the total is from the organizations' PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families. Velázquez's bill has passed the House Financial Services Committee by a unanimous 58 to 0 vote and was passed, in a voice vote, by the full House in May. It was received by the Senate the next day. The Senate read the legislation twice and then referred it to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on May 3. That was the last public action taken on the bill. If Rep. Jeb Hensarling does agree to convene a hearing, it would be the first related to the recent issue of financial sales practices in Puerto Rico. ""If enacted, this legislation would provide fundamental protections for the mutual fund investors living in Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories,"" Velázquez wrote in the letter.

"After Trump backs it into corner, 'inevitable' China hits US supply chains next, UBS economists say","UBS economists say they were wrong and now see the trade disputes between the U.S. and China escalating with potential economic ramifications.""At $450 billion, the list becomes comprehensive and supply-chain damage seems almost inevitable,"" the report said.","UBS economists said Wednesday their prior assumption was wrong and they now believe the U.S. trade war with China is escalating and could hurt the economy. Their note followed the Trump administration's announcement Tuesday that it plans tariffs on a further $200 billion in Chinese goods. The economists said they now see the potential for a trade war that could cause supply-chain disruptions, create inflation and bite into GDP. They said they had expected just a list of new tariffs, but the U.S. Trade Representative is seeking an expedited process to impose the tariffs as part of its existing case. That means the supplemental action will have its own hearing Aug. 20-23 and could be implemented by the end of September. ""Once the administration implements the additional $200 billion in tariffs, the Chinese government will almost surely retaliate. On this path, the US government would then almost surely retaliate in response, raising the stakes immediately to $450 billion in imports of Chinese goods under tariff,"" they said in a note. The UBS economists said the $50 billion was aimed to limit economic damage and alternative goods were available to replace impacted goods. ""At $450 [billion], the list becomes comprehensive and supply-chain damage seems almost inevitable; many of the goods on the longer list are imported largely from China, making substitution essentially impossible. Such an escalation pushes the situation from a trade skirmish to a trade war,"" they said. The economists said they had not included an escalation in their economic forecast, and the larger amount of tariffs would do economic harm, weigh ""substantially on GDP growth and boost US consumer inflation."" The economists say there is a way to reach a positive outcome through negotiations, but with the escalation the path to resolving the disputes has ""narrowed substantially."" The U.S. imposed tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods last Friday, and China retaliated with a like amount. An additional $16 billion in goods are expected to be tariffed under this first $50 billion round. But the second round had come sooner than expected, with more detail. News of the new tariffs sparked a global equities sell-off Wednesday. ""While we now believe these new tariffs will be implemented, understanding their precise effects requires detailed analysis and a specific forecast of further actions both from China and the U.S.,"" they wrote. Because the additional tariffs are supplemental to the first round, the negotiations would have to resolve the U.S. issues with Chinese IP practices.

"There could be a major move in the bond market in 2019 but don’t panic, UBS analyst says ","The yield curve indicator has caught the attention of investors over the last few weeks given that the line has become flatter.Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management, told CNBC last week that the indicator will continue to flatten and invert in late 2019.","Markets could be in panic mode by late next year if the flattening yield curve turns into a full-on inversion, but it won’t turn into a massive sell-off, the head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management told CNBC. The yield curve, which shows the gap between the interest rate on the two-year Treasury note and the rate on the 10-year U.S. bond, is interpreted by several investors as an indicator of an upcoming recession. As the gap between both yields narrows and the curve flattens, the more the market believes there will be economic turmoil. This becomes a more worrying phenomenon when the yield on the 2-year note becomes higher than the one on the 10-year paper — a phenomenon described as an inversion of the yield curve. This is because it indicates that markets see a higher risk of borrowing money for the short term than at the long term. In a growing and healthy economy, lending at the longer term should be seen as a riskier because it is harder to predict what’s going to happen. The yield curve indicator has caught the attention of investors over the last few weeks given that the line has become flatter. Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management, told CNBC last week that the indicator will continue to flatten and invert in late 2019 — causing major stress among market players, who will be wondering whether or not a recession is about to kick in. ""I expect that the U.S. yield curve will continue to flatten and will invert in late 2019. While I expect volatility around the inversion event to pick up, I don’t think investors should take inversion as a sign of an impending recession,” Browne told CNBC via email. “The absolute level of rates is very low, and thus an inversion will have less of an impact on financial conditions than in the past,” Browne said. Interest rates have fallen to record low levels in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis to prop up the economy. Only now, about seven years down the line, central banks have started to assess and implement some rate hikes. However, the expectations are that rates will be moving gradually and thus remain low for some time. According to Browne, because rates are low, an inversion of the curve won’t bring a huge impact to the markets. ""We do not expect a massive sell off from yield curve inversion. While there will be volatility around the event, the practical implication of inversion should not induce a significant sell off given the low absolute level of yields relative to growth,” she added. Morgan Stanley also argued in a note earlier this month that it forecasts the yield curve will invert by the middle of 2019.",2018-07-23,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/yield-curve-to-invert-next-year-but-dont-panic-ubs-analyst-says.html?&qsearchterm="

The latest news on the additional round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods did not ""totally surprise"" everyone, she said, given that investors knew they would likely come. ""We still think, among all the emerging markets, China's still representing the most attractive market,"" she told CNBC at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.

But the impact of the tariffs on the Chinese economy will be ""very small,"" and the Chinese government is now ""prepared"" to manage that, Cai pointed out. ""In the meantime, the Chinese government has taken a lot of proactive policy, such as loosening up monetary policy, and the central bank maybe going to ease more credit. So that's taking these opportunities to further beef up China's domestic consumption.""

They highlighted the prospect of repeat elections and the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government as potential flashpoints that might derail recent progress among Italian lenders. ","Italy's banks have made steady progress in reducing their exposure to bad loans in recent months, but the potential for further inroads is likely to rest on the outcome of the upcoming general election, UBS analysts have said. The euro zone's third-largest economy has been hamstrung by a sizeable pile of non-performing loans (NPLs) over the past decade. This unwelcome legacy has spiraled to such an extent that Italy not only has the biggest exposure to NPLs of any country on the continent, its bad loans also account for almost 25 percent of the European Union (EU) total, according to the European Banking Authority. The next challenge for Italy's banking sector looks likely to be the result of Sunday's general election. UBS analysts suggested the outcome would probably be ""broadly neutral"" for the banking sector, before adding that there are two outcomes that could spell danger to the industry. They highlighted the prospect of repeat elections and the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government as potential flashpoints that might derail recent progress among Italian lenders. ""In such cases, a potential increase in sovereign yields would impact banks via higher funding costs and the mark-to-market of government bond holdings,"" UBS analysts said in a research note published Wednesday. The European Central Bank's (ECB) massive program of quantitative easing (QE) has aided Italy's economic recovery in recent years, while also providing a platform for the country to make strides in reducing its pile of bad loans. Nonetheless, an extended period of robust economic growth is essential in order for Italy to make further progress. The Swiss bank has estimated that the Italian economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2017, lifted by domestic demand and trade. Meanwhile, the rating agency Standard & Poor's upwardly revised its sovereign credit rating by one notch to BBB in October — the unexpected change marked the first such increase for more than three decades.

Analyst Steven Fisher, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, also told clients that a potential dividend increase and a strong earnings performance this summer could prove lucrative for shareholders. ""We think the slow recovery in Deere's large agricultural business could accelerate in fiscal year 2019 with higher grain prices, which have a favorable set-up entering the growing season,"" Fisher said in a note Thursday. ""We think higher grain prices would stimulate a recovery in North American high-horsepower tractors, which have been declining for five years."" In addition to the burgeoning demand for tractor equipment, UBS believes Deere will raise its dividend 21 percent in fiscal 2018 to a 30 percent payout ratio. Assuming the company continues to return 50 percent to 60 percent of its operating cash to shareholders, Fisher said, Deere will have $1.25 billion in cash flow left over to buy back shares.  The equipment maker upgraded its sales outlook earlier in the year, citing stronger conditions in its agricultural and construction markets. For the past four years, Deere has been struggling against weaker demand for farm equipment as global oversupplies kept a lid on prices.  ""Given the recovery ongoing in 2018 and management's expectation that operating cash flow will grow 56 percent year over year, we think it is very likely that Deere could raise its dividend and continue to buy back shares,"" Fisher said.

"China's bond market to surpass Japan as world's second largest in five years: UBS","China's bond market will double from the current $9 trillion over the next five years, UBS Asset Management predictsChina will overtake Japan as world's second largest bond market behind the U.S., according to UBS Asset ManagementPIMCO says China's yield curve indicates ""strain"" in Asia's largest economy","China's bond market will double in size from the current $9 trillion over the next five years, overtaking Japan's to become the world's second largest behind the United States', UBS Asset Management said in a report. Underpinning that growth is a law passed in 2015 to prohibit local provinces and cities from borrowing from banks. Instead, they were required to borrow in the public debt markets as Chinese authorities sought to transfer some risks away from banks. ""We believe more and more Chinese entities will raise capital in the onshore bond market, given that the domestic market is already large and liquid enough to attract new investors,"" the Swiss fund house wrote in its report. It predicted that China's local government bond market will grow to more than $3 trillion in the next three years from the current $1 trillion — just about on par with U.S. municipal debt size of $3.8 trillion. Such growth prospects, coupled with the country's financial reforms, make China's debt market an attractive investment, UBS said. Those with higher credit risk may select state-owned enterprises, local government bonds or issuance by the five largest banks, it added. ""In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, unorthodox monetary policy led to asset price inflation in all traditional asset classes. This in turn has created yield compression, with the amount of negative-yielding sovereign debt globally estimated at $8.6 trillion, according to Fitch Ratings (March 2017),"" according to the UBS report. Chinese bonds, on the other hand, offer ""attractive yields"" on both a nominal and real basis, UBS said, adding that ""there remains the potential for capital gains should bond yields move lower from their current levels."" The fund house also noted Chinese bonds' ""defensive characteristics"" (investment grade and a from net creditor country) which make them ""attractive in a portfolio context."" China's rising debt and moderating growth have often been cited as a key risk to global markets as the country's economic influence widens. Moody's last month downgraded the country's rating from A1 to Aa3 and flagged that its economy-wide debt levels were expected to increase further in the years ahead. Reforms were only likely to slow China's growth rate, the agency said. Yet while UBS may see opportunity in the bond market, China's own government bonds may be signalling problems with the wider economy. In a note this week, PIMCO's emerging markets portfolio manager Isaac Meng noted that the 10-year Chinese government bond yield sank below the one-year yield — which happened only once before, on June 2013, amid ""a severe liquidity crunch in the interbank market."" ""The [People's Bank of China] has clearly tightened monetary conditions, pressuring banks to curb corporate and mortgage lending while passing through higher lending rates to borrowers… On the margin, China's monetary tightening and financial deleveraging will be a headwind to a rebound in global manufacturing and reflation in commodities,"" Meng wrote.

For reference: That's roughly 1.5 times the size of the U.S. economy in 2015. The wealth of this demographic group, now roughly ranging in age from 21 to 35, is driven by inheritance, entrepreneurial activities and income gains, the bank said in its report Thursday. ""Looking ahead, this generation looks set to benefit from one of the largest intergenerational wealth transfers ever, carried out over a comparatively short timeframe,"" write UBS' Mark Haefele, Simon Smiles, and Matthew Carter. Quoting a 2015 Accenture report, ""Baby Boomers are expected to pass down around USD 30 trillion between 2011 and 2050 in North America alone."" But companies are going to have to do their research in order to win business from this generation.  ""It is critical that institutions adapt to the needs of these new guardians of capital,"" Simon Smiles, UBS' chief investment officer for its ultra-rich client group, said during an interview on CNBC's ""Street Signs."" ""A first step in making changes would be to understand millennial tastes and behaviors, comparing those to other age groups in order to establish any observable differences,"" he said. For their part, UBS suggests three differences in millennial traits compared with older generations: a desire for convenience, multi-channel delivery, and transparency. According to the Harvard Business Review, millennials accounted for nearly half of all on-demand consumers in the U.S. in 2015, compared to 22 percent aged 55 or older. In turn, Deloitte Digital announced that 47 percent of millennial consumers used social media as part of their shopping experience. Smiles added that millennials are more concerned than their parents are with the sustainability and impact of their consumer choices and investing. He said 87 percent of millennials ""are likely to check the sustainability criteria of the products they buy. They're two times more likely than the average person to divest from a company that does not meet sustainability practices."" They are also risk-takers in business.

UBS analyst Eric Sheridan noted that his $1,600 ""upside"" scenario is primarily based on Amazon growing North American and international sales by more than he and Wall Street expects.  ""Such upside could be driven by: 1) better than expected sales stemming from Prime subscriber growth; 2) success in new geographies and new product verticals within its eCommerce competency; 3) better than expected overall retail sales; and/or 4) little to no long-term headwinds stemming from hardware/software/service sales from competitors such as Apple and Google,"" Sheridan said in an investors note.

During its annual Prime Day last week, Amazon sales broke records, growing over 60 percent from 2016 and adding more new Prime members than on any other day in the company's history. UBS bullishness is about CEO Jeff Bezos' leveraging four ""long-tailed opportunities"" in Prime, third-party sellers, advertising and Amazon Web Services. ""Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods is one of the most recent examples underlining the company's ambitions to drive greater wallet share among current Prime members,"" wrote Sheridan. ""Based on our last UBS Evidence Lab survey among 2,500 US consumers, 75% of respondents stated that they had never shopped for groceries on Amazon before, followed by household products (65%), personal care products (52%) and pet supplies (51%).""

The fines for UBS and Deutsche Bank will be upward of $10 million, while the fine for HSBC will be slightly less than that, the people said, without providing exact figures. Spokesmen for HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and UBS declined to comment. Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions. Spoofing is a criminal offense under a provision implemented as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. Some of the manipulative behavior came to light as a result of the authorities' previously-settled probes into forex market manipulation while UBS self-reported the wrongdoing, according to two of the people with knowledge of the matter. The bank investigations have been ongoing for more than a year, one of the people said. The settlement is the most high-profile brought so far by the CFTC's head of enforcement James McDonald who was appointed to the role in March 2017. McDonald, who was previously a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, said in September he plans to encourage companies and staff to report their own wrongdoing and cooperate with investigators, a strategy he hopes will make it easier to prosecute more individuals.

","Shares of Netflix rose 1.5 percent in after-hours trading Thursday after an analyst at UBS upgraded the video-streaming giant. Analyst Eric Sheridan hiked his rating on the stock to buy from neutral. He also raised his price target to $410 from $400 per share, implying a 26 percent upside from Thursday's close of $324.66. In a note to clients titled ""Taking The Blindfold Off,"" Sheridan cited the success of Netflix's content, solid subscriber momentum and a better understanding of the headwinds the company has faced recently. ""After six months of stock underperformance & key debates emerging about competition, margins & FCF, we think these debates are better understood by investors and reflected in the current stock price,"" Sheridan wrote. ""With content spend now at a scale of the major media companies and titles continuing to demonstrate outsized marketplace success, we see the moat around NFLX's global positioning widening and its long-term secular winner status remaining intact."" Netflix shares have been on fire to start off 2019, rising 21 percent in the first seven sessions of the year. The surge in Netflix comes after the stock plummeted more than 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. ""Over the past months, the potential for new (& more pronounced) competition for both subscribers and to source original/licensed content among regional & global streaming media companies has caused NFLX's stock volatility to remain pronounced,"" Sheridan said. ""However, looking at the global opportunity among home broadband (~790m global broadband households (ex-China) in FY2023) and/or mobile device users (~2.9bn global smartphone users (ex-China) vs. NFLX estimated penetration of ~20% in FY2023), we see a long runway for NFLX subscriber growth that remains intact despite increased competition,"" he added. — With reporting from Michael Bloom.",2019-01-10,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/10/netflix-shares-rise-after-hours-on-upgrade-by-ubs.html?&qsearchterm="
"UBS names the price where the British pound becomes a 'buy'","The EU and the U.K. have agreed on a flexible extension of the Brexit deadline to Oct. 31.But the extension could open the door to general elections in the U.K., which could increase the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, said Tan Teck Leng, a foreign-exchange analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management.Such ""heightened uncertainty"" could send the British pound lower to 1.24 against the U.S. dollar, which is ""the opportunity for you to buy pound cheaper,"" Tan said.","""Heightened uncertainty"" over Britain's divorce with the European Union could be the trigger that sends the pound even lower, making it more attractive for investors to buy, according to UBS Global Wealth Management. The pound has been trading above the 1.30-level against the greenback over the past month. But increased uncertainty could send the sterling to levels of about 1.24 or 1.15 against the U.S. dollar, said Tan Teck Leng, a foreign exchange analyst at UBS. The EU and the U.K. on Thursday agreed to a flexible extension of the Brexit deadline, pushing it to Oct. 31. That would allow U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May more time to garner Parliament backing for a withdrawal agreement, take the country out without a deal, or cancel Brexit altogether. ""We don't think that Theresa May is able to get the current deal through the U.K. parliament. It is not likely to happen and with that, it opens the door to general elections,"" Tan told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Thursday. ""Is that higher or lower uncertainty? It is a lot higher because you don't know the parties, if they were to campaign, are they going to campaign on a harder Brexit or softer Brexit,"" he added. ""If you get a no-deal Brexit, it is not going to be 1.24, it is going to be 1.15 or below — that is the reality. Now, what can take the pound down to 1.24? The simple trigger would be just pure heightened uncertainty,"" he added. He explained that the U.K. heading into general elections will likely introduce greater volatility into the currency markets. That will result in the pound trading in a wider range, with the possibility of touching 1.24 against the U.S. dollar — that's ""the opportunity for you to buy pound cheaper,"" said Tan. Some investors have stayed away from trading the pound due to uncertainties on how the U.K. would leave the EU. Jasslyn Yeo, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said she's been taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach on the currency. Yeo said she has also remained ""cautious"" on European stocks as a whole, partly due to Brexit. ""We continue to remain cautious on European equities especially over a 12- to 18-month time horizon. But that's not just because of Brexit, there are other reasons,"" she told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Thursday. One concern cited by Yeo is the potential earnings disappointment among European companies. She explained that margins — an important driver for earnings — are likely to suffer because of higher wages in Europe. In addition, economic outlook for Europe is ""challenging,"" she said.

"Adidas shares rise 8% after first-quarter profit hike, improved outlook","Shares of Adidas jumped 8% on Wednesday after the company unexpectedly raised its full-year guidance and reported a year-on-year profit increase in the first quarter.The firm raised its full-year revenue and operating profit guidance on the back of the results.","Shares of Adidas jumped 8.2% on Wednesday after the company unexpectedly raised its full-year guidance and reported a year-on-year profit increase in the first quarter. The German sportswear company said that it now expects currency-neutral revenues to increase at a mid-to high-single-digit rate in full-year 2024, compared with a previous projection of growth near a mid-single-digit rate. Operating profit for the year is now expected to reach around 700 million euros ($745 million), Adidas said in its unscheduled trading update published late on Thursday. It had previously forecast operating profit near 500 million euros. Adidas has been selling off its loss-making Yeezy inventory since breaking ties with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The firm said it now expects the sale of the rest of the Yeezy inventory during the remainder of the year to result in additional sales of around 200 million euros. The company also said its first-quarter operating profit rose to 336 million euros, up from 60 million in the same period of last year, according to preliminary figures. Unfavorable currency effects are expected to weigh ""significantly"" on Adidas' profitability this year and impact both reported revenues and gross margin development, the firm said in its report. Adidas underwent a transition year in 2023 after it lost revenue from the Yeezy sales. Back in March, CEO Bjørn Gulden said that he expected some growth in the first quarter, which will strengthen in the second half of this year. The underlying sales growth from the Yeezy products confirms the ""rapidly accelerating momentum"" of the Adidas brand, according to UBS analysts. The guidance and continued expectation of better sales growth throughout the year will be taken well by the market, making Adidas one of the ""best earnings momentum stories in the space,"" the analysts said. The sportswear company is also seeking a boost from its partnerships with the Olympics, Paralympics, EURO 24 and Copa events this year. Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, flagged that the company's Terrace footwear brand should drive momentum in other franchises. ""With a packed summer sporting calendar, the group is investing in performance shoes (running and basketball), and as inventories are cleaner,  we suspect retailers would want more of adidas on their shelves, as evidently the brand is picking up,"" said Valechha. — CNBC's Ganesh Rao and Jenni Reid contributed to this report.",2024-04-17,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/17/adidas-shares-rise-after-first-quarter-profit-hike-improved-outlook.html?&qsearchterm="
